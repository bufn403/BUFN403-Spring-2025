And so the FIDs that we're seeing now, give me confidence about the trajectory for 2020. You're early to call growth rates for next year.

We're seeing international pricing. It is getting traction. It's getting traction around tool shortages in demand in certainly the North Sea. We've seen it in a few other markets as well.

And it seems like your thinking is evolving in terms of how you're looking at CapEx next year. Could you maybe just walk us through a little bit of flex points? I know it's still a bit early in the year, but how you're thinking about some of the flex around putting that budget together. I think one of the most common questions investors are wrestling with now is, for Halliburton, with the largest legacy frac fleet, how electric frac may or may not factor into those thoughts into next year? Could you help, maybe frame that out for us a little bit?",0.8731265,0.807

Clearly, we're in the early planning stages. But I wouldn't have highlighted if, it wasn't going to be meaningful. So, just to kind of discuss CapEx 2020, we believe firmly that we don't sacrifice growth and opportunities internationally and we still have room to grow in North America if customer budget support that, important, the kind of behavior and decisions that capital scarcity is driving and we will then continue that into 2020.",0.7117953,0.954

And at that point, we're presented with choices and this is around replacement. Do we replace that asset with a quiet fleet or a dual fuel fleet or in this case could be an electric fleet?

And then Lance, I mean, can we talk a little bit more about working capital? You mentioned the inventory build in the first half of the year and your expectation that that will convert to a source of cash in the back half. How would you characterize collections across the different operator types at this stage? Are we in a fairly normalized environment or there's still some challenges here?

So, look over the last two years, we've generated over $1 billion of free cash flow and I expect that that trend continues in 2019. Now we've got work to do in the second half of the year, but the path to that free cash flow generation first starts with sort of margin improvement in 2H, particularly with our D&E business, right? But it also includes making progress on collection. We saw DSO improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I suspect that that will continue throughout the course of the second half of the year.",1.1396694,0.955

We've invested a considerable amount in inventory in the first half of the year as we continue to deploy iCruise and our Sperry technology deployment as well as I expect us to burn that down in the second half of the year in addition to the normal traditional completion tool delivery that we expect in the back half of the year.

I mean James, I'm not ready to call 2020 at this point, but there's no reason not to believe that's possible. I think, the thing we're going to stay dead focused on though going into 2020 are going to be margins and we want profitable growth.

I mean I would say that our state customers look at that scenario and realize that service pricing isn't adequate and returns aren't adequate and need the work done well and we have a lot more success with those customers and that's a bigger group of customer. It gets to be a bigger group of customer all of the time. It also helps when we say or demonstrate that tools are sold out and we can do that by making choices and so that also helps.,0.0003709,0.935

And so we looked at all of this in terms of returns. From a share perspective, the pace that I'm describing actually is perfectly adequate if we're happy with the returns and the technology deployment to keep up with where we are in the market.

We also discontinued the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business, leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognize a $12 million pretax charge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our completion in production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%.

From a labor perspective and, if you described 20 more fleets into 2022, your 40 to 85% utilization today, that takes us what, like close to 100.

During the fourth quarter, we recognized $2.2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted largely of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. They also included approximately a $100 million of cash costs, primarily related to severance. As a result of the charge, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a benefit of approximately $35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which reflects two months of DD&A impact. The after-tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately $0.03 of EPS, of which $0.02 is included in our Completion and Production results and the remainder in Drilling and Evaluation numbers.

In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease. This decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction. This decline was partially offset by higher yearend completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, revenue was $598 million, a 2% decrease, resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region.

I think, what the key is that the setup is constructive. And so, managing capital in a more prudent way, focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth, all of those things conspire to create an environment, where we're able to get better pricing. Is it widespread, I'd say it's generally widespread, but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others, sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing.

The collection cycle is still going to be very similar. Albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer DSOs, so we may see some impact there.

And I think today, our business, we need to address the $3.8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years.

So, it isn't that we are starving anything. The reality is we're feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations.

Look, I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically. And that is the reason why I think you see that bifurcation today, it's more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today. And I kind of view it that way. It gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed. That's why I tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to -- okay, here are the more digestible groupings being drilling, production and reservoir, and then even down into the tools. Because the reality is number of these tool don't have to be integrated but they can be and they are more effective when integrated. And so, if I use a fairly simple example, like in EarthStar tool, it's a tool, it's metal, it runs in the well, it's fantastic tool, but what's most important about it is the answer product, which is the 3D inversion. And now, that 3D inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere. But that's difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it's very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems. So, the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform, the ecosystem as you described it, while at the same time, driving immediate returns around these tools.

And obviously, at the same time, we'll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this. So, I think it will be deflationary in some ways but I think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really winds the moat that may be isn't there, is prevalent today, but I think we will see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us, in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business.",0.606454,0.727

I think as you might expect, some of the spend in our pressure pumping business would be more in line with DD&A. So I think, as we look out for the reminder of the year, we believe the range of $1.6 billion is the appropriate level of CapEx given the strategic investment that we're making in the level of activity that we expect at this point.",1.214876,0.615

What's your confidence level in terms of C&P top line being able to grow year-on-year and your confidence level in margins bottoming in the first quarter and the first half of the year?",0.1157198,0.837

So we typically will see margins bottom the quarter after we see activity bottom, and that's not unusual that's kind of what we're seeing happened in Q1 right now. What I see on the - as I look through the balance of the year, if we think about the DUC count that's out there and that it needs to get converted into cash flow by customers. Pipes alleviate as we work through the year in the Permian Basin. No question about that. Supportive price environment, commodity price environment, which we do see shaping up at this point, and so that will be very helpful.

Lance, could you maybe just - is there a range that we can talk about around that $1.6 billion? You give some detail on where you expect to see some of the growth areas, maybe within North America depending on how things shake out as you go through the year, could we quantify a bit of how that could flex from that $1.6 billion?",0.2007668,0.816

But I think it's pretty obvious from the rest of our commentary that we are willing to flex down, if need be, if it doesn't play out the way that we think it will with the catalysts that Jeff described.

We have become the largest service company in North America and that growth didn't by accident. First, it was due to the leadership of Jim Brown and his visionary management team. They saw the potential of unconventional resources in the region but the same time as a group of key early mover customers.

We continue to collaborate with our customers to lower the cost on these projects and while some are moving towards FID, it's important to remember that there is a significant time between planning FID and revenue generation for Halliburton. And finally, I've been consistently more conservative on the international market. And it's played out exactly how I called it. Today, I expect that there will be improvement and activity over the remainder of the year. But these improvements are not concentrated enough to offset the continued pricing pressure. As a result, the international markets will continue to move sideways. With all of this said, it's important to understand that we are now into the third sequential year of significant under spending in the international markets. This implies that the production decline outside of certain OPEC countries will begin to accelerate, particularly next year as the backlogs of new projects are completed and additional projects are not coming behind.",0.6817507,0.975

We believe current sand price levels have encouraged operators to optimize their completion design using more science as opposed to simply maximizing sand and trade for increased production. We maximize returns on our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customer's cost per BOE. Our strategy around technology development is to make returns for Halliburton. Very simply our decision process around technology can be summed up in a three questions. First, does it reduce cost?

What are we doing around new build equipment? The simple answer is that we are first and foremost a returns focused organization. We have the ability to make a series of discrete decisions around equipment and will only bring it out under certain conditions. First, that it is backed by customer commitment. Second, that it captures leading edge pricing which is accretive to our margins. And finally, it generates acceptable return on investment. So let me remind everyone, that we have not invested in our legacy fleet in two and half years, prudently managing the health of our fleet is important to maintain the type of service quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect. Therefore, some replacement of equipment will be necessary over time. Our manufacturing center in Duncan is a powerful, competitive differentiator for our organization. It allows us to be nimble and build equipment is needed with short lead times. This flexibility allows us to control the rate at which we manufacture, building as little as 2,000 horsepower at a time if need be.",0.8356825,0.949

And that's because we got there faster and cheaper than we thought. Our Duncan manufacturing team just simply way out performed both by speed and bringing down the cost of everything. The other thing that happened is our people went back to work faster and that's principally because of all of the demand that we saw for our equipment. I supposed one other thing as we were successful in bringing back a large quantity of former Halliburton employees which is something we always wanted to do, but that also mean to say go back to work more quickly with substantially less training. As we look ahead to Q3, obviously there will be new challenges to deal with. For example our employees. Our employees haven't had raises in three years. So we plan to for example provide our employees with raises. But I would like to do is to listen Chris' guidance on completion and production.

But let's go back to why there is a spread there. And it's because we are aligning with very good customers, they are very efficient and so we want to be part of their business. And we believe we can do a lot to help drive down sort of their overall cost and lower their cost per BOE. And so that's why we never had -- we abandoned half the market to go move somewhere else. We absolutely want to support all of our customers. So I am not going to give that spread. But I'll tell you it's something like I said in Q1 that we would be closing in on that over four quarters.

So I mean I'd say we are probably in the 60% range or so for the following reactivation. The important thing about that equipment is that it is build for total cost of ownership. I mean we don't sell this equipment in the market. Our guys at Duncan are absolutely motivated by one thing. What is the most resilient, the efficient piece of equipment? And I go out and check to make sure that it's competitively priced which it is, but more important thing is cost is what it does for our guys in the field. And the way that it is integrated. So it runs a higher rate, it uses all the available horsepower, it's more efficient by still about a 20% efficiency compared to what we see in the market.

That gives put to work with clearly an economic backdrop. And I think that back to Dave's earlier comments on our customers. I mean this is an incredibly adaptive group of customers that I think it demonstrated through tougher cycle in our history and ability to consume science, consume lesson learned and move the cost per BOE down almost in the face of anything. And so I think what you are seeing is really the nature evolution of, okay as inputs move up for better ways to get more barrels and in some cases we are seeing that.

Trans load infrastructure that we have is valuable. I'd say probably the toughest part to get to realistically is the Permian basin and local sand in my view opens up a whole new avenue of what is lower cost.

Cost is always a component of that. But we've seen other media sort of go into vogue and out of vogue and we've got mark risk out which is an NO style solution or micro style solution. So I think that obviously what's being talked about today is consistent with what I hear from customers. And what is being consumed today. But again that the drive for better science is always going on and that's one of the reasons our labs are constantly looking at, how to take what's available and make it better and how to either or to substitute with things that are better.

Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region.

Look, I really like the macro setup, and I have said that before. And what we really see is the fragility, as I described it, of supply and the returning demand. And so, I think, there are factors that the underinvestment internationally means that has to be recovered over a longer period of time. And I think a lot of the return expectations of this industry in North America are still in place and such that is a bit of a cap on production growth. But nevertheless, the activity, that just means a longer upcycle in my view. And I feel really good about the cadence, meaning it continues to move up this year, next year and beyond. And the way that sets up for us is we got -- we have an opportunity to take advantage of the operating leverage that's already in our business. The pricing environment will be good throughout that period as equipment gets tighter everywhere and our technology is more valuable to customers in this kind of environment.",1.7488872,0.976

Just from an e-fleet deployment standpoint, we view e-fleet as replacements for our current equipment. So, the pacing of that is consistent with how we think about sort of fleet management over time.

And what I expect happens with electric broadly is, yes, it grows, our share will grow of that. I think we've got fantastic equipment in the market working today. But the power piece, we're power-agnostic. And if you recall, over time, I've always said, the issue here was the power, who owns the power. And I think we've partnered with a very good firm, successful firm that has modular power such that over time, as operators can optimize power sources, meaning the grid, our partner has the ability to scale that back and sort of optimize along with clients.

I'm excited and encouraged about what I see, more so today than I was before, which was all the -- it's basically the simultaneous growth, North America and international and the -- effectively, the demand for equipment that we see, which now allows both activity and price to move at the same time. So I don't -- from a risk perspective, look, I think that we're in a good place to manage those risks that might be out there, whether it's a range of things.

And I think we're in a great position to take advantage of all of those things that happen, whether it's price and tightness, it's our technology.

We spent a lot of time on this call, I know Jeff has, talking about the trajectory of the denominator in that equation. And we have work to do on the numerator. So, we expect to continue to find ways to attack gross debt. And I think starting with retiring the '23s and what's left of the '25s post this redemption is a good target.",1.1900826,0.852

So, this is the result of technology investment, an excellent drilling business, drilling technology, collaborative approach with our clients, our value proposition; and the other service lines that are in D&E, very strong service lines, drilling fluids, I won't try to name them all here, but a very strong group of businesses. And I think what you're seeing in the margin is a demonstration of the improvement in capital velocity that we saw from the new technology in Sperry; also the improved capabilities, whether it's LWD or the ability to manage the data around that with the 3D inversion. So, there's a whole series of things that we've been working on and actually have many more things left to deliver in that business during 2022. So, our expectations are that we're starting at a higher point -- or we're starting the year lower, but we are moving to a higher point. And I think we'll see that sort of repeat.

But you're right. I think stronger free cash flow starts with stronger margins. And I think what you should expect for 2022 is to see that continued strength, operating cash flow less or excluding working capital to continue to drive higher, obviously. But I think that we're running into a period of time in 2022 that the amount of growth that we expect in the business is just going to drive an investment in working capital as opposed to a release of cash. But, as I've always said, we are looking to put that investment back much more efficiently than when we took it out.

Latin America Revenue grew by 5%, resulting primarily from increases in software sales and project management activity in Mexico as well as stimulation activity in Argentina.",0.4049793,0.765

Look, when I talk about flat earnings, that does not mean flat revenues. We see revenues up in North America and quite frankly internationally, and expect to outgrow the rig count in both. From an earnings perspective, let me say this, internationally, we face the same issues as our competitors. In North America, quite frankly, no one knows it better than we do. And I've already mentioned a lot of those challenges in my remarks.

I mean this was a fantastic quarter and delivered the highest revenue, highest margins and best returns. But, I did talk about customer dislocation in the northeast to a degree as they've met their production goals, and at least likely moderation or perception of moderation in the Permian Basin. But, I do know with certainty that 2019 is going to be humming. I mean, we're looking at demand that's already on the books. And I know this business. And so, whenever equipment moves around or we see any kind of slack in the system at all, I know the maintenance goes up, cost. And I've told our people to take advantage of that and spend more but be ready for 2019, which realistically translates into about $0.04 incremental impact on Q3.

And it's part of a strategy that we've had in place to grow our chemicals business. It's a small acquisition, but it's the kind of thing that I'd like to do because it gives us all of the platform to grow at organically from here, and it complements some things we're doing internationally. Over time, it's going to deliver terrific returns. We are early in that cycle having just closed. But, the approach that we take on these kind of acquisitions, really works. This is an example where we buy a plant that's sort of moderately utilized. We've got internal utilization that will actually ramp it up to a high rate of efficiency and lower our costs.

But, as I described, it's not naïve to the math. I mean, clearly, this is the world class resource. And the entrepreneurs in that market will get it solved, I mean never bet against them. But in the near term, I think perception has as much impact as anything. And by that, I mean weighs on customer urgency, which ultimately has an impact on our utilization and efficiency.

Debt-to-cap, as you mentioned is still low 50s. We want that to be down in the 30. So, some work to do there. We've made a lot of progress on debt repayment, $1.5 billion in 2017, targeting about another $1 billion in second half of this year. That's 2.5 billion in total over two years, and that's put a meaningful impact on credit metrics. But, we still have some work to do. And we'll be thoughtful about looking for opportunities to do that going forward, as we think about how to deploy excess cash.

So, first, we are seeing some tightening in certain markets. And I think, it's got going to be -- sort of international is a really big place. We can't paint it with only one brush. As I described North Sea, seeing some tightness there, we'll see some tightness in markets as we move around. And as a baseline of work is tendered, the follow-on work after that quite frankly is where there is more opportunity from a pricing standpoint or bidding, tendering standpoint to do things around price. And I expect that will unfold as we work into '19. But the base level of business is always very competitive, and that's where a lot of efficiencies and work is done to improve those. But, so, my comment around tightness is, I think I'm seeing some tightness in certain service lines, as I described billing tools, which I think will drive some tightness. But, it's more -- it will come in sort of geographies. Now, unfortunately, we're seeing this across a number of geographies in terms of an uptick. But as far as that tightness goes, that will be sort of one at a time, I expect.",1.5678783,0.915

Deepwater, as I've always said is sort of the last to come back into the frame. And I think deepwater still is push to the right as far as widespread recovery. But, the macro that we see shaping up is certainly encouraging, but the kind of deepwater, new AFE type activity I expect is going to require confidence in what is the long term outlook on the forward-look on oil, which I think is improving and is reaching a point that it's supportive. So, as we look out a couple of years, I think that's where we see inside of that three-year window, as you described it, as we see deepwater pick up, probably in a more meaningful way. And exploration, again, the exploration that we're seeing so far has been certainly more focused around sort of step outs and things that are near to existing infrastructure, generally speaking. And I think more confidence, a, in cash flows and by our clients. And again, speculating here, but I would expect that as confidence builds, so will that.",0.9981454,0.99

So, we've certainly done some work around electric frac fleets and have tested that process and how -- and what we think about it. Not convinced today that -- well, I shouldn't say that, but we need to see that unfold and see what are the real return capabilities of that, mean the physics say, it still has to generate energy. We have to move big things around. So, I'm not as convinced that we see the type of return around the cost of that, it's probably a 2X cost of getting into that electric sort of power generation versus what we're able to accomplish today.",0.9903561,0.929

Certainly, in markets where -- really across the piece, there is demand. We still have inbound demand in a market like this. So, I'm describing efficiency, the challenges to utilization efficiency through the second half of the year. But, that's not to say we don't see inbound demand today. And we also see very strong demand as we go into 2019. That's the North America comment. As I talked about international, again, we see a contract set that we won today. And we also have visibility of, sort of, as I described last quarter, the doubling of tender activity. That's all going to manifest over the second half of this year.

But, those decisions would be shortsighted, in my view, not right for the business. So, as I said, what hasn't changed is Halliburton does have largest revenues, highest margins, best returns. And so, we're going to do those things to capture as much of 2019 as you expect and probably more.

I mean, because of the things I've described this morning, I mean, I think the total market is temporarily balanced. And I know our equipment is sold out and we could sell more. And that's because of there's a lot of demand for what Halliburton does from a service quality standpoint, reliability, efficiency and technology. And the demand or the pressure, the work rolled on the equipment hasn't changed, and that's the -- so, it means that the attrition story hasn't changed either. And we still see probably half of the incremental horsepower that comes into the market being ploughed back into existing fleets, and that's reason I spend so much time and we spend so much time managing fleet size.

It is important to remember, we were coming into this downturn from a very different place than in 2014, and we believe these differences prepare us better for what lies ahead. Spending in the North America market was down in 2019. In response, we introduced a new playbook to prioritize returns over market share.

Given the forward outlook, the uncertainties, $600 million a year staying on the balance sheet seems pretty useful. I appreciate you have no intention to take on leverage to fund the dividend.

I guess to compare and contrast, we took out $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. That was largely -- that was fixed cost as we approached the business. I described this cost reduction similarly, because it is not the variable item. So I guess it's overhead and it's things that are fixed, it's things that take big steps down when you take them out, you don't necessarily add them back, in contrast to crews and the equipment on location and the supplies and all of the things that go with that. So a lot of that -- a lot of our strategy around North America really had been to accelerate our ability to make those decisions and take costs out quickly.

And the current environment really accelerates or allows us to really test the art of the possible with respect to how we work and digital is front and center. And I can see, when we embrace that wholeheartedly as opposed to incrementally, we're able to do things quite differently in terms of less people, less footprint, actually working more effectively in my view. But it really does require divorcing the mind of what a lot of us grew up doing to make that step to, wow, this is all possible without you fill in the blank.

But I am an optimist and I think we take advantage of an -- time like this and say ""Okay, forget everything you thought you knew."" First and foremost, service quality and safety. Everything else, let's go relook at given the robust set of tools that we have. And a lot of these are tools that we've invented at Halliburton or they're built off of our own native cloud platforms.

We've seen a meaningful uptick just in the last 30 days in demand for native cloud services and apps and things that would allow not just working remotely but take the same kind of cost removal that I'm describing, our customers do that when they adopt cloud technology, a lot of what Landmark and our digital organization has been building and has on the shelf. And so it's really -- it's accelerated the demand for that. And obviously necessity is the mother of demand creation in that regard.

Historically we have generated cash from working capital during the last three downturns. I would say on the absolute amounts probably a little bit different profile than particularly the 2015 comparison that you were referencing, just given the fact that on an absolute basis our receivables and inventory are at levels that they were coming off of 2014 record level of revenue. So that's a little bit different, but I still expect the relative behavior to be the same.

But it's not the crews, it's partly crew size, but it's really all of the things that are in between the crew and sort of the overhead of the company. There are a lot of steps that involve designing work and how work gets actually prepared for delivery, the delivery of products and materials. The ability to embrace the automation of all of that is pretty meaningful. I think crew size can come down as well because there are a few things around the crew that are required to deliver all of that input. But I think the more impactful part will be all of the sort of transaction friction between sort of the top of the organization in there.",0.1824926,0.964

And so in that kind of environment, there isn't much flight because there's not a lot of new things being added.

The early work around trials in a number of countries continues on. It doesn't take much capital to get that going and continue that strategic push into those markets albeit I don't think we'll see the same growth that we had anticipated. It's more a matter of pushing those services or delivering those services through the existing infrastructure that we have. So, to continue that strategic initiative is one that we bought those businesses in order to do that. Obviously, we'd like to see better market for those services as we do this. But it doesn't change the fundamental interest and actually opportunity to continue to do the things required to grow those businesses.

I mean that's just -- it's moving so quickly that our view on the U.S. is that we see dramatic reduction in Q2, though not able to call a precise number or timing and then likely kind of works off the rest of the year, the -- flattish. The international market reacts a little differently and I just say that because taking a frac holiday is a lot different than taking a deepwater rig holiday. They just happen at different paces. And so, we've got a view of slowing activity internationally. It doesn't necessarily slow at the same pace that we see it, just because they pick a day, it's like we're going to stop on X date, but it's not today. It's at a point in time. And so, I think that unwind is over more than just Q2, albeit the COVID-19 disruption part should get behind us quickly. It's the same operators that are conserving capital in the U.S., in many cases are the operators that will look to conserve capital internationally. NOCs, if we had a grade level of how effective or impactful, NOCs would be less impacted, probably IOCs more so internationally over the balance of the year.

By that I mean, returns are front and center, albeit challenged, but we're not chasing market share, don't intend to. I don't think that the dynamics have changed. The things that form our view on our strategy for North America haven't changed, the bigger full cycle type things. And so therefore, we're going to manage our costs. We're going to look at the returns on equipment, the best utilization of equipment, whether that's to stack it or work at. But we don't believe that anyone working below EBIT or EBITDA is not going to be successful in the long-term and we plan to be very successful in the long-term.

The market never really recovered from '16 other than nominally. So if it would be hard to follow the same distance.

The dialogue with them at least with me has been disappointment over the near term, but all to bit firmly in their teeth looking ahead to what it looks like on the other side. And the dialogue is always that we're going to need to be super competitive and work with Halliburton when we get to the other side.

That said, though, the ability to reduce cost by implementing these things is in the here and the now. I mean that is like here and the now this week having an impact. And so I think the ability, for example, on our integrated projects as we -- this accelerates the acceptance by customers and the demand even by our own people to implement those tools that de-man rigs, work remotely, all of those are tools that we've been building over the last several years.

But again, if we step back and think about North America, to maintain steady production, whatever the exit rate ends up being, implies the number of wells that need to be drilled. And so, if drilling is below that, then we start to see production drift lower, which then would have a positive impact on commodity price and an impact on - more so on international activity.",1.7010386,0.813

So, those cost cuts are permanent. I expect when activity moves up, we'll see margin improvement follow. We'd see D&E margin start moving upwards when we see broader international drilling activity recover. As I've described, how we might see that next year. C&P is going to benefit from stronger completions activity recovery in North America and also internationally. So, I think C&P probably sees recovery more so first. And margins in D&E improves, gets into the double digit range as we see more sustained recovery internationally. So, again, really like where we are strategically.

In fact, we were seeing a lot of good things happening in Q1 and it tailed off in Q2. So, I don't think the full year of 2021 eclipses 2020. But trajectory I think is really important because that leads to the eventual recovery that I believe happens. And so, I think we get on that pace starting in 2021? Does it overcome 2020 immediately? Not necessarily. But it's going to just be slightly below. I think we're on a pace because of the sort of under investment that we're seeing. And we're seeing it in the US today and we'll see it - we've seen it really internationally.

And so, there are a lot of things that we're doing that are different that will allow us to make more free cash flow in this type of market. And so, I think all of these things are positive.

As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery.

We are stronger, technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature fields, completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas.

We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient and as longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion.

We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services companies still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre-pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remained supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program.",0.4747774,0.941

I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels with completion spend outpacing drilling. I am excited about Halliburton's future in North America and here is why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing.",1.0801187,0.967

Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs, and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return.",0.8123145,0.975

Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time.

In the North Sea, we have successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job for the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain.

Let's begin this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9% and adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America.",0.4206612,0.856

In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits.",0.9433884,0.914

In our completion and production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia.",0.7528926,0.637

These increases were primarily due to higher drilling related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia-Pacific and Guyana and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia-Pacific and Saudi Arabia.",0.8045455,0.823

These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year end completion tools and software sales. Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil.

These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million, or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region.

While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our completion and production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points largely due to a different business mix.

Is it the - the question in my mind and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further is the outlook for the full year '21. With North America, I know you mentioned -- you feel like the momentum is still good, but I guess first is there some peak that we are going to see or some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined which should get back to kind of this maintenance level?

And I think in terms of magnitude into the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe we will be up low-double digits. So, that's fairly solid and that's based on the tender pipeline that we are seeing and the types of barrels that are produced shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. And maybe one last word on international outlook, I mean, I think we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean, 2020 was the worst in our history, and we view 2022 as when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multi-year upcycle, and so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there.

Look, I think it's simply as it relates to the guide that we gave, it's simply a business mix for C&P. So, we have got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not the same level of profitability. But look, we are encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business, and I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I would remind you and others on the call that we are starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and that's on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations are that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we are happy with what we have done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business.

So, I am encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that's coming off again a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectation is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we are ready to do that through capitalizing on obviously a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we have made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021.

Yes, I think the free cash flow profile for 2021 versus 2020 will be much more from an operating profit perspective, right. So the full year of cost cut benefits will be rolling through 2021. We will also have the increased activity that you have heard us reference so far on the call. Yes, you are right, capital discipline and our philosophy around that remains in place, but as the business begins to grow, working capital will require investment, right as activity picks up. And so think about it outside of some of the noise that's created from working capital movements. So excluding working capital for a second, I would expect free cash flow to more than double in 2021. Is that helpful?",0.0731405,0.942

And then on international markets, you talked about shorter cycle maybe taking back some share, I think that makes sense. And you noticed that tendering activity is picking up, can you just talk about expectations for bidding behavior between you and your competitors, how that may compare and contrast to what we saw in the most recent cycle? What should give investors confidence that tendering rounds may look different than what they did in the most recent round we saw, let's say prior to the pandemic?",0.1999258,0.992

Look, Sean, I am not going to comment on the strategic and the competitive issues that you brought up. But what I can speak from our perspective is our focus is on profitable growth and profitable growth that maximizes free cash flow and drives returns. And I would say that, that's been something that is important and we were making progress on that in the first quarter of 2020 in terms of improving margins and cash flow and returns and then we took a COVID pause internationally. Now, I don't think dynamics have not changed in terms of available equipment for the international markets during the COVID period of time. So, with activity and our focus on profitable growth, I am encouraged by what I see, clearly, it's always competitive. Certainly, it's always competitive. But that focus on profitable growth is front and center with me.",1.8330861,0.44
HAL-2020-Q4-2021-01-19,81,Question,2021-01-19,4,2020,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess so I wanted to come back to the conversation around kind of your E&P spending and then kind of your outlook for 2021. I don't know if you can maybe just take a minute and talk to which your expectations are for North American E&P spending this year and then also on the international side, I know you said kind of activity up low double-digits in the back half of this year for international, but I don't know if that means that we can actually kind of get more flattish spending this year by E&Ps or is that still going to be down?",0.0871662,0.995
HAL-2020-Q4-2021-01-19,82,Answer,2021-01-19,4,2020,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, from an international standpoint, I mean, I think that's a fairly tight range around flat. But I also think what's more important is the improvement that we are seeing into what we believe is supply and demand balancing in 2022 and that's the right kind of trajectory to have going into that. And so if we have got double-digit growth in the second half of the year, we have called the bottom in the first quarter of the year, we used to kind of work through that. And like I said, I believe that the tighter range around flat, but I think that's going to be, it's got to be the path to solid improvement. And I am pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison, but the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined, but we have got a lot of road to go just to get back to where we were, even pre-pandemic when the first quarter of '20. And so I think that and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So, just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook, which gives me good confidence that while we have got good momentum in the first quarter and we have got pretty good visibility for the year. So, I think that our outlook that, that momentum it builds in the first quarter, but it doesn't fall off at the pace that it has in the past certainly, I think that just because the drivers will be different. And I think capital discipline and flat production coexist in the market and that's what gives me confidence.",0.6060831,0.202

We will see different behavior at different times. Yes, I think the under the most important thing is I think we are going into a multiyear cycle internationally and building profitable roads is what will be most important and certainly most important to Halliburton. And I say it that way, because the equipment availability hasn't changed. Certainly, we do capital efficiency as one of our strategic priorities, which also means we want to put it to work where in the places where it's going to make the best returns and that's not going to be everywhere. That's going to be in the best returning opportunities, but I think there is enough growth there. And again, it's this multiyear cycle, it's the balancing in '22 and the progression through '21 gives me confidence in certainly taking that approach.",0.7644659,0.818

Hey, just I wanted to follow-up with you in the context right on the international front since that's been a point of focus on your messaging, you kind of gave the dynamics for the second half of the year, but when you talk about short cycle opportunity sets and short cycle projects kind of what regions and areas would that be geared to?",0.0764095,0.93

So, I think it's going to be fairly widespread in terms of where I think it's the type of work and again, the short cycle type barrels of what require less capital upfront, they yield production more quickly, they demonstrate better returns for operators.

And then I want to follow-up on your experience using highline power to run frac in the Permian. We have outlined some benefits of that highline power relative to turbine-driven e-frac.

Look, we learned a lot through the first project and so early days and still learning, but we have always said about electric that the capital upfront around power was going to be the sticky wicket and one that we were not willing to dive off and invest in, because from one day to the next, it's not clear what's most efficient. We actually knew all along that ultimately there would be a better both market for availability for power and also ultimately grid power. So, I think that there is a lot of collaboration that's required. There is a fair amount of technology involved in solving for how to get power of where it needs to be. But I can - as I said in my remarks, it's a very good solution to both a capital efficiency problem and an emissions problem. And I will look forward to seeing it catch on, so I don't think it will be immediate, because it takes quite a bit of work upfront to get that all put in place and very much a commitment by the operator to stay the course.",0.1364985,0.859

We certainly saw a lot of it visibly in 2020. And I think our view is or my view is that the supply and demand gap continues to tighten. I also think the market structure is improving. And so - and as we look forward from here just normal attrition or normal replacement probably runs 10% to 12%. So we have got that at a minimum in front of us. I also think that capital constraints are - the current market for capital and capital investment makes us a lot tougher for companies. And so harvesting and cannibalization of equipment that we saw in 2020, we also saw entire transactions predicated to a degree on harvesting equipment as part of that cycle, but all of those things are taking equipment out of the market.

We're not trying to put older equipment into the market. And because of that it makes for a totally different conversation. But I think backing up and looking at overall supply and demand, it looks like the market's undersupplied probably 1 million, 1.5 million horsepower today. And I expect that it stays that way certainly for this year and likely beyond. And a lot of that is because of the attrition that I talk about that is very real and we look at horsepower announcements versus actual fleet adds. And all that does is it affected about half of the horsepower announcements going back into existing fleets tells me that that market stays tight. And so for that reason from our perspective anyway, we see solid pricing. We push it every day. We're not going to get into the strategy around how we do that, but certainly see cost recover - pricing recover, inflation out there as well as pushing on the net pricing side of that as well.",1.9161721,0.891

We look at pricing internationally. We're excited about the volume of activity and we like to see more tenders. But I can tell you our customers know that we're at the bottom as well. And so from our perspective price is actually continuing to move down not up internationally as we start to see the large projects come through.

So, Jeff, maybe if we could talk about where your contract position sits for frac just thinking about your existing fleet versus leading edge pricing, how much that roll forward do you think will support incremental margins for the year even if net pricing were more on the flatter side just to give us a sense of how much that impact could be?",1.2056466,0.74

So price is always important. So when I look at margin progression, clearly price is important. But at the same time utilization is an important lever and allows us to move on the margin front as does technology help us do the same thing and technology in effect helps our customers generate more value but at the same time reduces our cost and that's the important piece of that in terms of supporting our margin expansion outlook for the balance of the year. Our business development guys are in the market every single day and because of our efficiency and technology and science, that's the price support for what we do. But at the same time those are the two levers very important.",1.4465875,0.967
HAL-2018-Q1-2018-04-23,87,Question,2018-04-23,1,2018,Sean Meakim,JPMorgan Chase,"So in terms of looking through the year, fair to say that there's still some pull forward as your backlog of contracts rolls into current pricing, so that's a net tailwind for you?",0.7518299,0.318
HAL-2018-Q1-2018-04-23,88,Answer,2018-04-23,1,2018,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I would say if we look back a year now and talk about the contracts that we had there, a large part of that has rolled over. And so what we look at now is improving the margins on the contracts that we have. And a lot of this does get to efficiency and this is one of the reasons why our business development team is so focused on where are the customers where we can get the best efficiency and utilization. That's a key part of how we expand margins. And so that opportunity is clearly still there. Customers remain urgent and that customer urgency is critical because even spending within cash flow, for example, urgency around effectiveness of every dollar spent matters a lot and that may not have been the case two years ago at the absolute bottom of the downturn but today that is a critical factor for our customers. And again where we spend a lot of our energy is making sure that we are able to execute that way.",0.0051929,0.933

And then just thinking about the other service lines in North America, curious how pricing progressed end of quarter when thinking about drilling services, cementing, wireline, coiled tubing? You touched on it a little bit in prepared comments but just what are your expectations for those other lines as we move through the year and the impact on C&P as well as C&E?",0.4112931,0.61
HAL-2018-Q1-2018-04-23,90,Answer,2018-04-23,1,2018,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think none of those service lines declined as much as pressure pumping did through the downturn, so they don't have as far to move up.

HAL-2018-Q1-2018-04-23,96,Answer,2018-04-23,1,2018,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Angie. We look at sort of headline horsepower in the marketplace. We think it's probably 18 million horsepower, somewhere in that range. We look at what's been announced in terms of new build and reactivations that comes to maybe 4.5 million horsepower. Of that, we expect roughly half of that is going to get plowed back into existing fleets. In Halliburton, we've maintained our fleets at 36,000 horsepower on average which tells me that we're getting differential performance around that equipment. And so that clearly in my view with the kind of rig count that we have today and the outlook for growth this year keeps that tight. And so I think that's how we see it unfolding for the balance of the year. Now your question around horsepower age, so much of that has to do - we think about our horsepower in terms of how effective is it on location and clearly we've got proprietary technology around our pumping and in other things we do around maintenance, et cetera. And I think because of that, we're differentially positioned in the market and of course that has an impact on where we can work, how effective we are, what kind of margins we can earn.",1.3230712,0.936

But I'd say today it's staggered. It's all over the place as we work through the downturn and back out of the downturn, a lot of variability in what contracts look like.

Now I think so full year will be about $2 billion, a little bit higher than we were guiding before. And I think it's important to note that we're pretty thoughtful about our capital investment decisions always looking at it through the returns lens and is it going to be value accretive, is it going to generate attractive returns. And that's what we saw with the opportunity with regards to the CapEx rate. And the majority of the increase is going into Sperry. And so we're excited about it. As Jeff talked about, this is a product line that we underinvested in for a number of years. This is a strategic priority for the organization. We're seeing great demand both for existing technology and the new technology and it's actually positioning equipment for work in 2019. And we think we'll generate attractive returns over the long term. So we're excited about the opportunity.

That's been something we've talked about it over some period of time and that's where I think the business settles. And if we go - we were getting to that place, we were at that place in 2014 realistically. What we had was demand go away but it wasn't necessarily an oversupplied market. What we had was a downturn where demand went away. But I fully expect that we'll work back into that range and that's just what we're doing with the levers I described.

And that's sort of the projects that we see or at least are in process of getting built. So it's probably never a 100% but it could be a substantial portion of the sand demand in the Permian will come from buy-ins in the Permian. It's a dynamic we're starting to see in other basins as well. What it ultimately does is it serves to relieve pressure on rail and then certainly provides for more availability of Northern White to the markets that will probably continue to demand that.",1.4981454,0.85

It's gone by a lot of different names over the years; integrated solutions, IPM, as I say a number of names. I think the key again is execution risk and how well we manage that. We're not afraid of execution risk and that's really the basis for the contract is that execution risk. What I do like about them is that they aren't the kind of investments in oil and gas that take long time in commodity exposure. So from a cash return standpoint, it certainly work. I'd say the key components of executing those well around project management and understanding that risk. We've got terrific experience during this. That share for Halliburton grew dramatically through the last two or three years and we've done it for a long time. And so the skill sets are different and it takes time to develop those and I'm pleased that we have those skills today at Halliburton and compete very effectively. But I would wrap up with though is that they do get progressively more competitive over time.",2.4580861,0.952

And having spreads spoken for is radically different from utilization in terms of pumping hours per day. And so we spend a lot of time and apply big data and apply algorithms and have a lot of effort put into how do we drive better utilization of our equipment every minute of every day. And there is a lot of room to run there. And that also is why I spend so much time talking about customers and where we are most effective and customers that better utilize our value proposition because that is truly a win-win.

It's probably less than overall market number though mid upper single digits is a good place to think. But it's more around specific markets where we see tightness. And part of what we see right now is a sort of thinly spread addition of sort of activity is not sufficient in any particular market to create the tightness that would allow for pricing inflection. And so I think it's better to look at particular markets as we go through this process and it is maybe the overall. Clearly there's a place where overall growth is enough to create overall tightness.

We've made a lot of gains over the last several years in terms of open hole and deepwater technology around drilling fluids is fantastic and growing. And so I feel like those margins will continue to expand as we see sort of tightness appear around the world internationally.

It may not be as strong just because we had such--you know, with the revenue declines just in the course of Q2 and the unwind around receivables, and then offset by payables, it was good to see. The organization continues to be really efficient on how we continue to wring out the cash flow generated for working capital.

As we expected, year-end presented some spotty activity caused by holiday schedules, weather and exhausted customer budgets. The frac calendar remained full due to the tightness in the overall market, but it came at a higher cost due to the increased idle time and mobilization required between jobs.

The price of sand escalated over the last few months of 2017, but I believe that increasing sand capacity, particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout 2018. Trucking is tight across North America and is particularly tight in areas like the Permian where activity is strong and locations are remote. We believe our increasing use of containerized sand will help mitigate trucking inflation by reducing the required trucks per well site and demurrage. Now, these headwinds were anticipated, are transitory, and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle.",0.175816,0.913

To remove any doubt, I am confident that we will achieve our normalized margin goals and here is why. As I've said before, we have three levers to pull in order to achieve normalized margins and they're working. All three levers are important and the great thing about Halliburton's scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull them all in a meaningful way. Halliburton is the execution company. We are going to pull these levers to get to our normalized margins.",1.7229228,0.881
HAL-2017-Q4-2018-01-22,21,Remarks,2018-01-22,4,2017,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The first lever is pricing. North America completions market remains tight and we are sold out. Therefore, we continue to push pricing across our portfolio. Improving oil price and demand for equipment provides runway for us to continue to increase our pricing through the first half of the year. The second lever is utilization. Equipment utilization is very impactful for a Company of our size. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. I can tell you that customers rapidly returned to work after the holidays and we expect improved utilization to drive margin growth.",1.1424332,0.967
HAL-2017-Q4-2018-01-22,22,Remarks,2018-01-22,4,2017,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Finally, the third lever is technology that reduces cost and increases efficiency and production. We use our continuous improvement initiatives to focus on designing technology that meets market demand and reduces costs for ourselves and our customers. A great example of this is Snapshot, our digital tracking and analytic system for our hydraulic fracturing equipment. With Snapshot, we can assess what every piece of equipment is doing every moment of the day. This big data application allows us to optimize operations to reduce downtime, minimize maintenance and compare the efficiency of completion designs. We're able to compare operations across basins and countries to get optimal results from our fleets. These levers, combined with superior service quality, allowed us to triple our margins in C&P since the fourth quarter of 2016. I believe the effort, economics and enthusiasm that I see today, puts Halliburton well along the path to 20% margins in 2018.",1.3219585,0.974

We have a set criterion, it is return driven, and we follow that criterion. That criterion was met in the fourth quarter and we delivered a handful of spreads to the market. This additional equipment along with our existing equipment maintained market share, improved our margins, and generated industry-leading returns. So, let's get some perspective.",1.1709941,0.649

The supply and demand dynamic is correcting and commodity prices are improving, supporting activity around the globe. Our strategy resonates with our customers. This helped us navigate the downturn and more importantly, positioned us to win a recovery domestically and abroad. I believe that the U.S. land market will be very busy in 2018 and that demand for horsepower will continue to grow. Rigs continue to get more efficient, but more importantly, completions intensity continues to grow with longer laterals and tighter spacing. As a result, I believe that the rig count to frac spread ratio has narrowed such that today, this ratio is nearly 2 to 1. Think about that for a minute. It's gone from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 in four years.",0.8638724,0.894

The impact of wear and tear on the working fleet is demonstrated by the industry's rise and average horsepower per crew. Today, the industry is forced to employ redundancy measures to mitigate non-productive time on the well site. We know this is happening because we see, customers pushing our competitors to bring spreads of 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower to a job while Halliburton remains at 36,000. As a result of drilling efficiency, completions intensity and equipment degradation, I am confident the market will remain tight in 2018.",1.2893175,-0.71

It's great to hear the change of tone in our discussions with our customers and to be able to work collaboratively with them to create solutions that overcome the challenging economics.

We're in every market around the world, so we have great visibility into that. And the short answer is there still a lot of pressure. When I describe green shoots, I'm talking about activity. But that activity is spread thinly. A lot of capital available in the marketplace, and because activity is spread thinly, it doesn't create the kind of tightness for a price inflection. And then, the concessions given were significant and in some ways continuing into 2018, some of those haven't even been implemented. So, look, trust me, my tone is changed and I see price inflection, but I don't think it's until later 2018 and certainly we will see it in 2019.",1.3753709,0.881

It takes -- that ramp is slower, Jim, because of contractual nature of the market and it's really driven off of, first and foremost, tightness in the U.S. But, what we are seeing is I think the kind of commodity price support that will build that confidence with our customers, which will then create the tightness, which then creates the path back. And so, and I guess, my last comment on that, I think our value proposition is perfectly suited to drive back towards those normalized international margins, because we are so focused on maximizing asset value.

It's a confidence building and we grow into that activity. But, what I'm most excited about internationally would certainly be North Sea. I think that's a market that's going to have legs in 2018 and we'll see activity growing there. And we're certainly excited about how we're positioned there, clearly excited about I think Middle East broadly.

I mean, literally more sand, bigger stages, takes longer to pump. I mean, you start to reach, generally, limits around what faster looks like. And there's a lot of debate at the minutia level around A versus B but realistically, overall, how much more does that move? When I think about making better wells over time, I think that will be more and more significant, just because the complexity of how this gets done will increase. And, typically, it involves working equipment harder, even if not necessarily faster, which I think keeps us all very busy over a much longer period of time, over the long-term.

When we allocate capital and we think about what we do, I look first at what do we do that's unique? What can we do that is unique and drive differentiation? And with respect to sand, we do more around moving it and pumping it and that's really our uniqueness. So you see us spend our capital on either equipment or technology around that equipment that don't add much technically to a grain of sand. And we've got great partners that we work with and I think we have always found that there's plenty of sand in the marketplace and the best thing to do is make the best returns.

But there are other parts of the market, Middle East, that have been fairly resilient throughout the downturn.

So if I slice it by mature fields versus offshore or onshore, it feels, certainly, like that's a better part of the business. And, again, from Halliburton's standpoint, it lines up perfectly well with what we do, in terms of completions and I talked about what we're doing around wireline and case fill wireline and some of those kind of things.

We said our North America sequential revenue would significantly outperform average U.S. land rig count growth, and it did. We told you that our completion and production margins would continue to expand, and they did. We said operators were beginning to optimize as opposed to maximize the use of sand and turn to technology to increase production; this trend held true as we saw average sand per well remain flat sequentially.

During the quarter, the U.S. land rig count effectively flattened as customers reacted to shareholder input and their own view of market conditions for the balance of the year. However, our revenue increased and we saw improved activity in our completions related product lines due to the natural lag between drilling and completing wells. Today, the industry is drilling approximately the same footage as in 2014 with half the rigs while completions intensity has significantly increased. As the rig count stabilizes, our customers are focused on efficiencies, optimization and making more barrels.

All three levers are important, and the great thing about Halliburton's scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull on them all in a meaningful way.

The first is sand. During the third quarter, total sand volume for Halliburton continued to increase, but our average sand per well remained sequentially flat. Data points from the last two quarters and my discussions with customers indicate customers are focused on cost-effective production. They hear a lot of conflicting anecdotes about sand used today, because they are based on individual operators and individual basis. But the facts are, for Halliburton, sand per well was down in the Bakken, Rockies and Northeast, and it was up in the Permian Basin. This happened because customers that know the production characteristics of the reservoirs have streamlined their operations to focus on cost per barrel of oil equivalent and are optimizing sand utilization. Conversely, those customers that are still drilling the whole acreage or exploring production boundaries at their reservoirs are continuing the pump jobs with higher sand loads. At the end of the day, Halliburton benefits from both scenarios.",0.9302671,0.922

Now, first, let me be clear. I believe the market is undersupplied today. At the same time, equipment is being used harder and maintenance costs are higher. As a result, there will be a greater call for new equipment, just to replace the active equipment that's being worn out more quickly, meaning the day when supply and demand come into balance is further out than people think.",0.4595697,0.34

We are pumping more sand with less equipment, and as a result, the maintenance costs associated with today's completion designs are increasing. The design of our equipment gives us an advantage over the market that even we have seen an increase in maintenance costs. I believe deferred maintenance is happening throughout the industry. A proxy for deferred maintenance and the simplest place to see it is in the industry and horsepower creeping crew size. Now, while Halliburton continues to operate with an average fleet size 36,000 horsepower per crew and have for the last several years, the rest of the industry is now averaging closer to 45,000 horsepower per crew.

We have the technology portfolio to solve our customers' problems from single density, variable slurry cement that can be used for all sections of well to our data sphere array monitoring system that due to its modular design provides customized reservoir monitoring. We help structurally reduce cost by decreasing the time to drill and complete a well or by producing more barrels. What's most important to point out is how we collaborate with customers and together we create terrific results. Another example is in the North Sea where our ruthless focus on service quality, collaboration with the operator and rig contractor, driving efficiency on critical path items and responding to customer insight has laid to record-breaking performance on a multi-well integrated services contract. This project is truly a collaborative effort and through the collective thought and execution of the team, they've been able to reduce the time to finish a full year scope of work by over 165 days, saving over $170 million.

And as I described, what we see in front of us in terms of activity as I described international, described North America, I think at that sort of pace, then we ought to have a business that returns solid cash flow from that kind of market. And so, when I've described those types of parameters it's to describe what we see. And you know again, focused on returns means that we are very efficient and we drive a lot of velocity with the equipment that we have, utilization, things of that nature, spend a lot of time talking about that.

Clearly, we need share to drive the volume and the scale, and that's where the efficiency and some of the things that I talk about are more meaningful at scale. But, specific to the building question, I'm just going to go back to what I said on this, answered this a couple of quarters now, but the three conditions being to meet client, leading edge pricing and generating adequate returns. But I don't think that -- there is a lot of juice in utilization, there is a lot of juice and in effect market share comes from better utilization.

This is -- for us, we call that integrated asset management, and it is really a capital allocation question; it's where do we put our capital and what will make the best returns. And so, -- and along with those better returns, my view, a key part of that is asset velocity and to produce returns for shareholders. So, we're not going to tie up our cash and things that we think had longer duration and likely lower returns. We have done some smaller deals, we've done a few things, we understand this space.

We're focused on margin expansion. We talked about margin improvement and our profitability. When we look at the pace that we're at, I mean, we got almost a 1,000 basis points of margin expansion in few quarters of C&P. And Jeff spent a lot of time talking about the path towards those normalized margins, the levers that we have to pull. So, we're confident of that path. Now, remember C&P is more than just frac and P&E in North America. We've also got our production business lines; we're investing in those business lines, looking to grow in line with that Summit acquisition.

And so, maybe not accelerating the way it did in the spring, but still opportunity and momentum in North America. I think if we look at Q3, bit of a cause just as commodity prices bounced into the 40s, but we talked about, first and foremost finding the right customer to drive efficiency, and it doesn't change the demand for our services today, and along with that comes ability to move on price.",0.8189911,0.875

We see that, calendar power being also important in terms of driving utilization and working with the efficient client. In terms of how far there is to move, each of those levers has fair amount of ways to move. I won't give you the specifics, but it's one of those things that we work every day. But it's the precision around, for example what happens on location being able to measure all of those steps. And again, the measurement scale is a bit of a different matter. But, what's special about that is that now when we make changes and drive efficiency, again driving better utilization, we can drive across just a fleet at a time.

But again, big push several years ago with our retrofit, the fleet with Q10, don't have that same requirement today, and that's when we talk about capital, that's why I'm comfortable with the kind of capital progression we laid out in this kind of market, because there is a very natural sort of replacement that happens over time. I will do that with Q10s, but I don't think it's going to be -- it won't be anything like maybe what you've seen in the past. And the Q10s really have delivered and we continue to go to market with solidly less horsepower than competitors.

The pulling on the different levers, you know us; we're going to pull every lever we got. But those are the big levers that when we pull them, have the more meaningful impact.

Summit was such a nice add, I give a shout out to the new employees we have from Summit, fantastic business and yes, very scalable. And clearly, the plan is to scale that beyond the U.S. and to our international operations. And those activities are underway. The other components of that, I've talked about chemicals. I think that will likely be a more organic move than it is M&A, maybe a little bit a bolt-on around that. But, the guys are working hard at that every day, and I really think that that is something that we will just systematically build out and we'll talk about it from time-to-time along that path, probably not every quarter but as it continues to grow, we'll give you a better insight into that.",1.0515579,0.945

For example, we're seeing more activity or at least signs of activity in the form of FIDs and things. But those are not tenders; those don't convert the service revenue quickly. We did find the bottom, but I think that those are very competitive markets with a lot of visibility around the activity in those international markets.

No, very excited about our strategy and I think we've laid that out but it is -- at its heart, and this is an important distinction and open architecture strategy which makes it a lot easier for customers to use. I think there will always be competition around data between customers. And I think customers are taking a closer and closer look at their own data and who owns and controls that data, and I suspect they will control it more so. It is just very competitive for our customers. And so, when we think about that, we want to make certain that we have the right set of tools that can be used effectively by them. And they're open in the sense that our customers uptake of those tools and they can make them do what they need them to do.

And I think that's more evidentiary of our market that's being learned as opposed to one being optimized and that makes perfect sense and that's what our customers do. They make the best investment and they manage their business very carefully. And so, when they make decisions to do more of something, there will be a reason for that. I think that's more the reason in West Texas today as reservoirs are better understood in other parts of the country that's where you start to see more of that optimization. But, I would expect that it does free up more cash for doing more work, which is certainly positive. But, I would not assume that they don't optimize in West Texas at some point either.",1.0259644,0.991

And so, there is more going on in that than purely North America frac. But, as it is a different question in terms of what kind of bottlenecks do we see, obviously, the Hurricane drove some bottlenecks here and across the country. I think that as mines come on, a lot of the bottlenecks you hear about around sand get alleviated. Again, when you have a bit of a differentiated view to those things given where we are and the fact our ability to buy at scale particularly with respect to sand, but then equally around people, again, we talk about people lot and our ability to hire the national level for people I think gives us a differentiated position as we view those bottlenecks.",1.8093472,0.761

So, to be seen. I fully expect we'll see the - we see it actually some today, the flight to quality. Our service delivery is very, very good; our safety performance very, very good.

We think it's 15% to 20% easily in the marketplace. But then, we watch equipment adds, of which there really aren't any, and we know how hard equipment is working. And so, I really believe we will continue to see that as we go into even 2020 in terms of the attrition happening. And our view of the market is we want to be super careful with our equipment.

That said, the performance of the tool, very good, very excited about what it can do. And coupled with EarthStar, for example, really is delivering on the technical promise that that we had hoped. So, I expect, as I look through Q4 and into 2020 and beyond that the value of this suite of technology is going to be very impactful.

Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $426 million, a 31% decrease.",0.2983471,0.44

In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 4% and operating income was $368 million, a decrease of 26%. These results were primarily driven by increased stimulation activity in North America, which was offset by lower pricing. The Completion and Production division also benefited from higher artificial lift and cementing activity in U.S land, increased stimulation activity in Latin America and higher completion tool sales in the Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions.",0.0247934,0.25

Operating income was $123 million, a decrease of 35%. These results were primarily driven by mobilization cost that we incurred on multiple international drilling projects, coupled with reduced project management activity and lower pricing in the Middle East.",0.4252066,0.44

In North America, revenue decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher artificial lift, cementing and stimulation services activity. Latin America revenue increased 28%. This increase was driven by higher activity for the majority of our product service lines in Mexico, increased stimulation work in Argentina and improved fluids activity throughout the region, partially offset by reduced drilling and testing activity in Brazil.",0.4417355,0.751

We will continue to differentiate in a very important, but highly competitive space in hydraulic fracturing. The intense exploration of top-tier acreage, fueled by rapid trial-and-error technology cycles led to the explosive increase in production from US unconventionals that we've seen in the past decade.

That doesn't mean there's nothing, but it also means that when we look at the market and how it's shaping up, that does -- will there be some trickling effects, potentially I'm not going to give precision around our strategy there. But what I will tell you is that we're saying no where the thresholds aren't met, which gives me confidence. And then aligning that with what we see around activity and tightening capacity, which all of that should progress as the year goes on and I view that as lending of support to pricing being behind us.",1.6034866,0.84

I think broadly though our view is that we will see tightening capacity on the balance throughout the year. I described how hard equipment is working. Also, the capital discipline that our customers see, we see the same and so I think the reduction in CapEx or the actual -- the discipline around CapEx goes a long way to support balancing of the market. Now when does it balance? I think it's more balanced later in the year certainly than it is today. So I think that's all supported.",1.3264095,0.827

So couple of years ago we took a fair amount of cost out, but most of that cost came in the form of an organization that would operate more efficiently and more quickly and it's really what we're doing here. This is not targeted at frontline by any means. What this is more around how do we brighten the lines and more quickly operate, make decisions and go to market now. The efficiency or lower cost is useful in any market in terms of driving performance, but that's not the intent.",0.9821958,0.965

On the first topic, we did stack equipment in the first quarter and I'm not going to go any further than that, but as we look at the market and look at returns on equipment that causes to make those decisions and we will continue to manage our business around returns. The second question though was around rebundling and look I've always had a view that over time those things that make sense to come back together do. I think we are early days of that, but there is just such an elegance and efficiency around how things fit together. That doesn't mean we're not very competitive with each slice and I think we demonstrated that. But at some point once the pieces and parts have been examined you start to see, wow, it's a lot simpler to put those pieces and parts back together but to come, James, but I feel good about where we are in that process.",1.935089,0.97

The -- look, I think what gives me more confidence is how broad-based this recovery looks today. And so we start to see not just a green shoot here and there, but I think as I described in my commentary nearly every region I talked about in terms of some form of growth we also see are broadening base of offshore sort of activity, not maybe activity and also the tendering activity that leads to more activity as we go into 2020. From a margin standpoint, I will focus those comments on D&E, obviously. We expect stronger decrementals as we -- incrementals, excuse me, stronger incremental to clarify that. What we saw in the first quarter, James, was I mean it really was a mix of different things both mobilizations that generally get done at midyear as we move to the year, the mix of services, there's a real pricing impact from the Middle East that we saw, I mean, a lot of the tender activity that happened in '18, it all started in earnest on January 1 of this year.

I mean in 90 days ago, we were coming off what was -- wasn't a clear path for commodity prices, obviously Q4 was pretty hard on everyone. So in the range of 90 days, commodity price set up. What we had thought would happen has happened in terms of customers going back to work. And as I said in my commentary, sort of each month was progressively building and that shapes our view. You know as we talk with customers, we look at the calendar, those things are all constructive as we look out to the next couple of quarters. More specifically around the second half of the year, a couple of ways we think about that, but I think importantly, is the production targets that are out there today, all of that require some level of completion activity to meet that. I also think that some part of the CapEx reduction gets captured in sort of other things, that's -- whether it's sand or service price deflation and maybe lowering rig count a bit. And I think the last question really be around, what do the smaller operators do going into the back half of the year? And I think they may be the most opportunistic, it's most important to them also just with the smaller asset base investing in completions really matters a lot to the value, not just of the asset, but likely the company.",1.1420623,0.935

I think the -- it kind of goes back to what Jeff was saying maybe an earlier comment, I think you may see some of the trickling effect to continue from the pricing side, but it's more than offset by the level of activity that we see, which is what informs our guidance, so it's really volume related with some modest impact from pricing.",0.7012397,0.402

As we look further in the year, particularly the back half, I think there are some sign posts that we look for in terms of production targets met, not met, also around rig count with smaller operators, what that may look like. And I think that cadence also could be different in different basins, but I think we obviously have discussions with customers and I think there's -- it's quite a mixed bag in terms of outlook and how they plan to manage activity throughout the year, but we are asking those kind of questions certainly earlier than we have in the past and I feel like with our business development organization and ability to be very sharp around the edges in terms of where we're and how we perform, I feel confident in at least Halliburton's outlook for the balance of the year.",1.6531899,0.943

We've historically -- and look we do a lot of business with IOCs, we do a lot of business with all -- all of the customers in the marketplace along different of those 14 service lines that we have. But we've -- historically, we've optimized our frac fleet around what we view as the most efficient customers, we could drive the most margin.

Through a degree we are reaching some sort of maximum velocity here just in terms of hours a day. If I would think back there have been some big sort of milestones in efficiency when Halliburton has been at the front edge of each of those. So the first was going from 12 to 24-hour a day operations, that was a big step. Next was more around zipper fracs as opposed to single well fracs and then multi-well pads as opposed to single well pads. All of those are sort of structural step changes. We've done a lot at the margin around being more efficient and our focus is taking capital off location not putting more capital on location. And so we do some things to drive our capital efficiency, but the big steps, I don't necessarily see those today. What I really see over the next cycle or the next few years is more emphasis around what's happening around the well bore as opposed to on surface and you hear a lot of discussion around that. But I say that to include everything from parent child, the spacing, the velocity, the all of these other things that we believe and I believe will have more impact on productivity and efficiency over the next three, five years.",1.3557122,0.883

Look, I think in terms of the sort of CapEx to revenue relationship that we sit at today, I believe it was like high 6% is lower than it's been on average over the last 10 years where we've averaged closer to 10%. I think, clearly this year, we've been pretty vocal about what buckets we're out spending as a part of that $1.6 billion of CapEx. I don't know that that -- to me, it feels like in and around 7% today, feels like a good number even for next year. Now the slices of that pie, right, as we go -- as we think about how we invest may change, but I think the rate of CapEx spend as we reinvest in the business feels pretty good.",1.6516529,0.956

I mean, we are focused on what I would call returns focused growth. And so if we think about where we are spending this year, we are continuing to invest in strategic initiatives and we are building out sort of our Sperry iCruise fleet and investing in international growth. So we are doing all of that today, sort of in and round where we and sort of the 7% -- 6%, 7% of revenues today. So it feels sustainable to me and I don't see this as a shift in our approach.

Even though spend is down in North America, that takes the form of lower sand pricing or lower drilling expenditures versus the actual completions activity. And then as we think about D&E, particularly driven by the international markets, we see a broad recovery, pockets of pricing improvement, but also weighed down by pretty competitive Middle East today. So it's a balance of all of that.",0.961157,0.765

And look, I feel great about Halliburton in this kind of paradigm. I mean, we've always been returns focused, clearly it starts with margins, so improving pricing and managing costs, we are always managing costs in that environment. And then I think disciplined investing, I think that maybe informs more of what you're asking, but we make capital scarce when we need to make capital scarce and we are also and might be investing in the right businesses. So if we think about lift and chemicals and where we've put our CapEx, we will do that very thoughtfully and certainly focused on returns.",1.2503709,0.975

I think it's tough to call -- hard to really put a number on it, right? I mean, I think attrition has always been a tough one to try to define in the pressure pumping industry. But one that we know it's happening because we see what it's -- how it's working on our fleet, right and we talked about some of the stats that we had in our prepared remarks, you can't ignore it. And today we know that there's under-investment. We know that there's more pressure than ever on all of the fleet in North America around wear and tear and therefore the repair and maintenance costs associated with it and the burden that a lot of our space has had to shoulder it, I think, look, at the end of the day, there's going to be some that are just going to flat out, be retired.",1.1892562,-0.828

And that's part of that discussion is making sure that we are investing and pursuing the right things. And look, we are really encouraged.

I think we told you that a third of the Sperry fleet will be iCruise by the end of the year, we are working hard to get those tools out, that's part of the working capital build that you saw on the inventory side that I mentioned in my commentary around the international strategic investments and so those are the things that give me confidence that we can continue to build on what we need to get to those commitments.",1.2053719,0.586

I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time.",0.4317507,0.0
HAL-2021-Q2-2021-07-20,114,Answer,2021-07-20,2,2021,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think that some of what we've seen over the last couple of days, I think, lays out a path for OPEC. And so, that's, to a certain degree, defined. If we look at pent up demand for oil at least today - if we look up the pent up demand that we see for oil today, we're at 98 million barrels a day now, the economy feels more than 2 million barrels shut in, to me. In fact, it's probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. So, I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. So then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation is that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of - is it 500,000 barrels, some number like that? Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022. That, the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly, and we have - in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So, those are the things that underpin our outlook.",1.1747033,0.778
HAL-2021-Q2-2021-07-20,116,Answer,2021-07-20,2,2021,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if we always look at our - we're fortunate today that we have one of the youngest fleets in the market. And as we replace equipment, we also have a large fleet. And so, as we systematically replace equipment, we have a choice to make. So, what type of equipment do we replace it with? And it's a combination, generally, of electric or dual fuel. But I think that our steady drumbeat of replacements and within our 5% to 6% of capital spend, we're able to meet demand and also at terms that are adequate. I think those two things have to be in place. Fortunately, we're in a position where we are able to deliver those things today. I say today, but today and over the near term from operations. Remains to be seen the pace at which all of that can happen in the market, given where sort of broadly that market stands today in terms of returns. So, without the returns, it's not - we wouldn't be investing in these types of equipment at all. Fortunately, we're in a position to do so and do it ratably along with our sort of planned replacement cycle.",0.7611276,0.785

But I think it starts with some clarity around what is the trajectory over time that's sustainable as opposed to all of the ups and downs that we seem to have had sort of intra-period gyrations. And I think what's shaping up today, as I've described it, is a more sort of predictable, sustainable trajectory. And that's what we see out over the next couple of years and really beyond that, just because I think we've been through a lot of the over-capitalization. There's been under investment for a long enough period of time, particularly in the resource that, as demand recovers, which it will recover, I think there's a solid opportunity set for our services.",1.3983471,0.459

And because of that, Halliburton has tools, whether it's our value proposition, our technology or sort of our portfolio and how it's placed to maximize value in North America, which we've always been clear on. We want to maximize value in North America and grow profitably internationally. And I think both those macros are set up perfectly for doing that. And so, as a generalist, there's some clarity around where we're going. We've got some track record of where we've been, where we're going. And I think that sets up well for a generalist investor.",0.4276706,0.765

And I think that we're going to continue to reevaluate what it means for us in the near term as we continue to grow into this recovery. We certainly believe that we need to improve those yields today on a dividend basis. But we're going to continue to look at and get comfortable with the forward free cash flow profile, what we think that this business, we believe, can generate in these out years that Jeff discussed. But, clearly, we believe it requires improvement from where we are today.",1.615727,0.938

Strategically, we have changed the cash flow profile of our business, and that is the shift from 10%, 11% of revenues going into capital down to the 5% to 6%. But what that does is that sets Halliburton up to do those things. And so, I think it's our view and the change in our cash flow profile certainly aid that process.",1.6687685,0.318

I'd say operators have not said anything about next year, and I'm not going to project what they might say. I think I have - we can see what the demand sort of looks like to us as we look out into next year. But I also think that every operator will make their own decisions around how they deploy their capital. And overall, a supportive commodity price, which we see creates headroom for our clients to do work and return cash to their shareholders, which is important for them to do. So, I think the improving commodity price and the structural sort of support that we will see in the commodity price makes all of that work as we go into 2022.",1.1873145,

And we really haven't seen budget exhaustion, to this point haven't talked about it. And I think that is because operators are ratably doing exactly what they said they were going to do. So, I don't anticipate that we see any of that or much of that this year. And I'd say the other thing that we've done a lot of work to variabilize our business, such that when we see slowdowns or holds or anything else, we're able to respond to it very, very quickly as opposed to how we might have done it in the past. And that all is process change and really philosophy change, but it's working quite well. I think we'll have a solid sort of working through the balance of the year just because of the clarity that our clients have and are providing to us.",0.8820475,
HAL-2021-Q2-2021-07-20,132,Answer,2021-07-20,2,2021,Jeffrey Allen Miller,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that as we look out, I believe that we've got the opportunity to meet those expectations within the guidance that we've provided with respect to CapEx. I think there is growth CapEx in that sort of 5% to 6% range that we've provided. For example, if I look back over the last five years, asset turns have improved by 50%. That's strong improvement. But this is back to my commentary around strategically approaching capital efficiency. So, as we're very sharp around our R&D dollars, drive capital efficiency, our process drives capital efficiency, and those are the kind of results we see in terms of capital efficiency. And so, we will continue to drive that as the market expands over the next couple of years. And really, strategically, that becomes our operating process. And I expect we'll continue to do that.",0.421365,
