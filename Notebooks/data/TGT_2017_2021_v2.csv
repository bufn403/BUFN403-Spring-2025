TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,6,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which gives us increased confidence that we are focused on the right long-term strategy. Our team is energized and remains on track to deliver the ambitious agenda we laid out for the year, including the physical transformation more than 100 stores in 2017. On the way to transforming, more than 600 stores over a 3-year period, nearly doubling the number of small format stores are shared in support of our goal to open more than 100 new stores in dense urban, suburban and college campus neighborhoods over a 3-year period.",2.4203848,0.979
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,7,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Development and rollout of digital capabilities that will continue to drive Target's digial sales growth in excess of the industry, completely transforming our supply chain from end-to-end creating a smart network of stores and distribution facilities that will allow fast reliable fulfillment regardless of how our guests use the shop, rejuvenating our own brand portfolio by launching 12 brands over a 2-year period, replacing brands that represent more than $10 billion of our current sales volume, investing in systems, training and additional labor hours in our source enabling our team to provide an even better experience for our guests and enhancing our value perception among consumers by reducing promotions and highlighting the right everyday pricing in key categories. Later in the call, John, Mark and Cathy will provide more details on our efforts to advance each of these priorities.",0.2914449,0.914
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,8,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On our last conference call, I mentioned that beyond our focus on advancing our long-term priorities, we need to have equal focus on strong execution in every channel, everyday. That's why we are really proud of the execution by our team in the second quarter as they delivered better-than-expected performance in a continuing challenging environment. In particular, second quarter traffic, which was up more than 2% was much stronger than our expectations and better than recent trends and the strength was broad-based across the country, across categories and across channels. And while the consumer and competitive environment remains choppy better-than-expected performance occurred throughout the quarter and wasn't limited to a short period within the quarter, with better second quarter traffic, we saw improved performance across each of our 5 broad merchandising categories: apparel, home, food and beverage, essentials and hardlines. 4 of those 5 saw comp increases in the second quarter, while comp sales in food and beverage were flat. However, given continued competitive and deflationary pressure in food, we are pleased that we are seeing early signs of progress. Specifically, we saw really strong positive comps in adult beverages and produce in the second quarter, both categories in which we have identified opportunities and focused on improvement. The positive response from our guests demonstrates that we are making progress and we are taking additional steps to build on that momentum over time.",0.8473189,0.993
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,9,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I also want to call out our progress on pricing and promotions. As we mentioned in the last call, we undertook this effort with a long-term view knowing that we might create some headwinds in the near term. Specifically, as we move towards a stronger everyday price proposition in our business and pullback on excess promotions, we can expect an adjustment period before value perception proves and consumers respond. While we continue to face the risk in future quarters as we expand the scope of this work, it's notable that in the second quarter we saw a meaningful increase in the percent of our business done at regular price and a meaningful decline in the percent on promotion. This demonstrates the progress we have already made and gives us confidence we are on the right track.",0.4064675,0.966
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,10,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I also want to call out the team's progress on Target's digital capabilities which continue to show up in our results. Target's digital sales grew much faster than industry in the second quarter, up 32% on top of 16% growth last year. If you do the compounding of these two growth rates, you will see that this represents more than a 50% growth rate compared with 2 years ago. And importantly as a result of our comprehensive effort by our team to reduce friction and increase the reliability of our digital operations, we have seen meaningful declines in guest contact center activity related to digital. This is a tangible reflection of our work to create a stable digital platform and successful collaboration between our digital operations and merchandising teams to create a more cohesive experience for our guests.",0.6299632,0.979
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,11,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"To build on this success the team is rapidly testing and rolling out additional fulfillment options for our guests. This includes Target Restock, our next day delivery option for everyday essentials that we recently rolled out the Twin City Red Card holders. It includes same day delivery which we began testing in our Tribeca store in the second quarter. It includes an early test of curbside fulfillment which we recently began testing with Twin City team members and which will expand to again facing tests in the third quarter. And of course our efforts include the expansion of ship and store locations, in-store pickup capabilities and our work with third-party providers to speed up ship times from our stores and distribution facilities. In each of these efforts the team is moving quickly, more quickly than ever before to rollout, test and iterate and expand where we see positive results. We are really excited to see the engagement of our team and the collaboration occurring across our operations which allows these tests to move quickly and we intend to continue moving quickly in the months ahead.",0.734343,0.954
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,12,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Another area where we have increased our speed is the development and rollout of new exclusive brands with last year's rollout of Pillowfort and Cat & Jack in kids we demonstrated the power of reinvention in categories that were already performing well. Specifically both of these new brands grow double digit comps following their launch last year. Regarding the Cat & Jack brand, we have long said that it was on pace to exceed $1 billion in sales in its first year. The performance has actually exceeded those expectations. Cat & Jack just crossed the $2 billion mark only slightly more than a year after its launch. Based on the success of those brands, our team took on the ambitious goal of launching 12 additional new brands before the end of next year and those plans are coming to life.",0.8354482,0.889
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,13,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"At the end of May we launched Cloud Island, an infant brand which we developed in partnership with our guests. And like last year's new brands Cloud Island has generated double digit comp increases in the period since the launch. In July we launched a new maternity brand Isabel Maternity and announced plans to launch four more brands in the third quarter crossing women's apparel, men's apparel and home. I also want to comment on our recently announced decision to partner with Casper in advance of the back to college season. I spent some time with the leadership team at Casper and I have been really impressed with how they think long-term and focus on outstanding execution on behalf of their customers. Their brand and products are a great fit with the Target brands and we are proud to be featuring their products online and in our stores, including a couple of exclusive items they have developed only for Target. This relationship is the most recent example of our ability to differentiate our assortment while helping outstanding brands to extend their reach.",0.5566926,0.984
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,14,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"During this period of rapid transformation in retail in which many others are shrinking, we will continue to look for ways to partner and deliver incremental growth for high quality brands while delivering differentiation and value for our guests. As we look ahead, we are committed to continued progress against our long-term goals. And we expect the environment will continue to be challenging. The pace of change in the consumer and competitive environment doesn't show any signs of slowing down. And we are well positioned to emerge as one of the winners in retail. It starts with the underlying health of our business, a business that generated profits of nearly $700 million in the second quarter. Our business is backed by amazing assets including our team, our network of stores and distribution centers, our unique merchandise assortment and a deeper relationship with our guest. Beyond those assets we have a very strong balance sheet and operations that generate a lot of cash providing us the flexibly to undertake the ambitious 3-year transformation we first laid out at our analyst meeting in February. And we continue to look for ways to move faster.",0.7126484,0.986
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,15,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In February, we announced our plans to complete 250 store transformations in 2018 on top of the 100 plus we are on track to complete this year. However, based on our success so far and the hard work of our real estate and construction teams to grow our capabilities quickly, we now believe we can accomplish more than 300 store remodels next year. While the scope of our transformation is large we remain focused on what has made Target an outstanding retailer over the long-term, all the way back to our first store in 1962. The key for us is embracing the power of ant which makes us unique among our competitive set. When we are at our best our model delivers the best of both mass and specialty retail. We deliver inspiration and convenience and we invite our guest to expect more and pay less. Because we delivered on all of those dimensions over time, we have developed a unique emotional relationship with our guests and we believe that relationship is positioned to thrive in the new era of retail.",2.9304134,0.981
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,16,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"If we continue to offer our guests inspiration and aspiration, differentiate merchandise and experiences and deliver convenience, reliability and great everyday prices we will continue to stand out and succeed in a crowded retail environment. One way to see how the best the Target comes together is a visit one of our exciting new small format stores we have been opening across the country. I visited our new store that recently opened on the USC campus and despite my loyalty as a proud UCLA graduate I couldn't help being excited by what I saw. The store is already quite busy even though most of the students have yet to return from summer break duty, baby, food and beverage are all selling well. And the store team is quickly evolving their assortment based on feedback from a diverse set of guests, it's truly inspiring to see the team interact with our new guests and an exciting new shopping environment and I am proud of what they do every day.",1.499386,0.989
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,17,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C.

First John will provide detail on our work and supply chain and our stores to enhance our fulfillment capabilities and provide a more reliable and inspirational experience for our guests. Then Mark will cover category performance and provide more detail on our recent and upcoming brand launches. Finally, Cathy will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and expectations for the rest of the year.",0.7617683,0.745

TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,19,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks Brian. Across all the operations team, we are focused on modernizing Target's network to create a complete seamless efficient and reliable menu of fulfillment options for our guests. And while we are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, the team continues to move with unprecedented speed developing skills and processes that allow us to develop, test and iterate much more quickly than we have in the past. Some of our fulfillment capabilities are already well developed and in those cases the team is focused on finding ways to increase our speed, reliability and reach. At the other end of the spectrum, we are in the early stages of testing completely new fulfillment options for our guests. In those situations the work is fully focused on learning from our guests and vendor partners, understanding what is most important to our guests and beginning to evaluate reliable, repeatable processes that will allow Target to fulfill guests rapidly evolving needs and expectations.",0.5607859,0.975
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,20,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Among our more developed fulfillment capabilities, we have offered in-store pickup of digital orders across all of our locations for years, but we continue to find opportunities to improve execution and we are seeing and continued momentum. Specifically through the first half of the year store pickup volume has grown more than 30% above last year and in July we saw more than 40% growth. As more and more of our guests respond to the convenience of order pickup, we are investing in system enhancements and store labor hours to continue to elevate the guest experience. These investments will be especially important in the fourth quarter holiday season when guests are particularly time pressured and rely on this fulfillment option even more frequently.",0.9181334,0.938
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,21,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Another way we can enhance the pickup experience is to offer a drive up option, so guests don't need to leave their cars. And in second quarter we launched the new test of the service, unlike the past when we partnered with third-party to offer this service this new test is being implemented with our own team members and internally developed technology. The offer applies to approximately 180,000 shelf stable items currently eligible for in-store pickup. And in the early stages, we are offering it only to team members in a handful of Twin City stores. However, based on our early results from the test, we expect to move to a guest facing pilot and select Twin Cities locations later in the fall.",4.5693819,0.361
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,22,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"While the capability for our stores to ship digital orders directly to guest homes was also launched 2 years ago, we are seeing even more rapid growth in this fulfillment mode. For the first half of the year ship from store sales are only about twice as high as last year, accounted for more than 40% of digital units shipped. Since the rollout of this capability we have added new ship from store locations every year. In this fall we plan to roll it out to another 350 stores in advance of the holiday season. This will bring the total number of ship from store locations to more than 1,400 stores. In addition, we are creating additional capacity by ramping up the order volume running through our mature ship from store locations. Because so many of our stores can now ship directly to guests, we have been able to increase delivery speed while still controlling costs and that in turn has allowed us to offer new fulfillment options like Target Restock.",0.9496521,0.935
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,23,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This service allows guest to order a shopping cart size box filled with items chosen from an assortment of more than 15,000 essential items like coffee and paper towels and have it shipped to their house for a fixed $4.99 delivery fee. Because these orders are fulfilled from a nearby store location, we can promise that any restock order placed before 2 PM will arrive at a guest home on the following weekday. You will recall that we rapidly developed this capability the team member test in the first quarter and we moved to the next stage of the test in the second quarter rolling out to Twin Cities Red Card holders in late June. Operationally, this guest facing test has gone well and as a result we just rolled out restock to the Dallas and Denver markets and we plan to expand into another seven markets before the holidays. With restock available in these 10 markets we will already be reaching one quarter of the U.S. market less than six months from the day we launched the test.",2.3663528,0.931
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,24,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond geographic expansion, we began offering restock to non-Red Card holders in all three test markets. We will be extending the delivery window by adding Saturday delivery and will move the cut off for next day delivery later beyond the current 2 PM cutoff. And given the strong store execution we have seen so far, we will begin ramping up communication and marketing efforts in restock markets which will increase awareness in order volume providing visibility into the capacity of our store team to reliably process higher order volumes. Beyond our internal fulfillment capabilities, our team is also working with transportation partners to improve the speed and cost efficiency of last mile delivery.",0.525174,0.836
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,25,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"To supplement these efforts, this week we announced our decision to acquire Grand Junction, a San Francisco based transportation technology company. Grand Junction has developed proprietary technology tools and has relationships with more than 700 carriers, allowing retailers to choose the most efficient option for last mile delivery on an individual order. While this acquisition is not expected to have a material direct impact on our financial results, we are excited to bring Grand Junction into the Target team and believe their model will help accelerate our progress in delivering speed, efficiency and a high level of service to Target's last mile fulfillment. We worked with the Grand Junction team on the test of same day delivery in our Tribeca store which we launched in the second quarter. In this test, guests who check out can choose to have their purchased items delivered to their home on the same day in a delivery window of their choice.",1.011052,0.975
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,26,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We have been pleased with the results of the test and have gained some useful insights from the guest response to the offer. For example, the value of the average basket for these same day delivery orders is more than 6x the store average at the Tribeca store and contains nearly 4x the units compared with the stores typical basket. Also notable home is the most common category in same day delivery transactions, ahead of essentials and food and beverage. And importantly net promoter scores for the same day delivery service have been higher than for the Tribeca store overall demonstrating the quality of execution so far. Based on these encouraging initial results, we plan to expand the same day delivery test to several other New York City locations in the fall.",0.7936963,0.95
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,27,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Of course the most common mode of shopping is still overwhelmingly in our stores. So while we are investing in new ways to leverage our stores for digital fulfillment, we are also investing to bring our great store shopping experience to guests across the country. This includes our remodel program in which we plan to transform the look and feel of more than 600 stores over a 3-year period. In support of this plan, we are on track to deliver more than 100 remodels in 2017. In the second quarter we completed 42 remodels, bringing us to a total of 63 so far this year. And while we are obviously seeing a range of outcomes on an individual store level, we are continuing to see average sales lists in line with our plan to deliver a 2% to 4% sales lift in remodel stores. And as Brian highlighted, the team is doing a great job of scaling up our capacity, which will enable a faster pace of remodels in 2018 than we previously expected. Beyond remodels, our team is delivering our plan to rollout more than 100 small format stores to dense urban, suburban and college campus environments over a 3-year period. For 2017, we are still on track to deliver our plan to add nearly 30 new small format stores. In July, we opened 9 new small stores across the country on top of the 4 we opened in the first quarter. While we have only been open a few weeks, our July openers have been particularly strong out of the gate.",0.6872698,0.941
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,28,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And as Brian highlighted, the guest response had been phenomenal. For the 7 small format stores, they have been open for more than a year, we are continuing to see sales productivity more than double the company average and these stores have been delivering high single-digit comp increases so far in 2017. So, clearly, our team has been busy transforming our assets and developing new and more efficient ways to fulfill guest demand. But as Brian mentioned, we also need to focus on execution everyday. Even though strong execution may not always grab the headlines, it has a real impact on our performance. An outstanding example is our work to improve the fundamentals of our digital business, which has dramatically reduced the number of guest center contacts related to digital transactions.",0.4126074,0.962
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,29,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Specifically in 2017, guest contacts per digital order are running 30% lower than last year. This dramatic reduction is the result of concerted effort by our team who looked end-to-end at the digital guest experience, all the way from our site and our apps to ordering, purchasing and fulfillment. Based on this foundational work, the team has worked methodically to reduce friction and pain points and you are seeing the benefit both in our contact statistics and in our digital traffic and sales.",0.5378633,-0.361
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,30,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Another example is our partnership with CVS. As we outlined last year, the conversion of pharmacies created some inevitable friction for our guests driving an initial decline in script count in our stores. Since the conversions began, we have been working closely with the CVS team to minimize the guest impact and build awareness of the benefits CVS can provide. As a result of our joint efforts, guest experience scores in our pharmacies have been climbing since the CVS conversion and are now running well ahead of our pre-conversion levels and we have been seeing the impact in our business.",0.7187884,0.691
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,31,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In the second quarter, comparable pharmacy script counts turned positive for the first time in more than a year. While this is encouraging, we know we have more opportunities to build on this momentum and we are working with CVS on marketing and guest engagement plans for the fall season. Execution in our stores has been a big focus this year and we are investing in hours training and technology to our large store team members to elevate the shop experience. Depending on the stores volume and buying patterns, we are adding hours to enhance the order pickup experience. In our visual merchandising teams in apparel and home, in beauty and in food and beverage and given all the brand launches that Mark's team is planning for the fall, we have invested in training and materials to help our store team is best present and sell these new lines to our guests. Across all of our stores, we are asking the team to increase their engagement with guests and ensured they are finding all the items on their list. To support this effort, we are rolling out a new tool that will help our store teams locate items, colors and sizes not available in their store and allow them to sell those items directly to guests right on the sales floor. We are in the very early stages of rolling out this new capability and guest awareness is still low, but we are already getting some initial insights. Not surprisingly over half the activity on these devices has been related to apparel where the ability to find additional sizes and colors creates particular value for our guests.",0.6422431,0.969
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,32,Remarks,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So now before I close I want to give a nod to the team. I am incredibly proud of what they have already accomplished and I am energized by their passion to transform our operations in our business on behalf of our guests.

As you have been hearing from many of the industry peers, this continues to be a challenging competitive and consumer environment. That's why we are particularly pleased by the ongoing progress we saw in the second quarter when we gained further momentum in the areas that we are already performing well and so improvement in the areas where performance needed more focus and our aggressive has come from both stores and digital channels, wherever our guests wants to shop us. From market share perspective, we saw broad-based market share gains across all ad discretionary categories. In hardlines, comparable sales grew between 3% and 4% in the second quarter, the strongest performance we have seen in 10 years. Growth in this area was broad-based including double-digit growth in both videogames driven by Nintendo switch and Apple within electronics. Toys grew more than 3% with board games continuing to be a strong highlight. This is an area where we already enjoy a leading market share position, but continue to grow and take further share due to our focus on innovation and differentiation within our assortment.",0.1770833,0.978

In apparel, growth was widespread across subcategories as guests responded to fashion and newness all underpinned by value through great price right daily items. We were particularly pleased with the ongoing positive performance in kids, which continues to benefit from last year's launch of Cat & Jack and is now achieving strong year-on-year sales growth and in our strong swim business.

We are also very pleased with the performance of our seasonal businesses from greeting cards to outdoor furniture. Within the seasonal event moments, our 4th of July holiday was strong as we quickly leverage guest and business insights from Memorial Day. In essentials, comp sales were up almost 1% benefiting from the launch of our Target Run and Done campaign that began in the first quarter. We are pleased with the response from our guests specifically with awareness and return on ad spend for this campaign, where results are higher than average. The top two messages guests recall from the campaign are that Target is convenient and I can fulfill all of my need to Target, which were our cool campaign goals. Essentials are also seeing the early benefit from our work to improve our value perception. Specifically, when we are price right daily on key audit and essentials, we are seeing increased traffic and unit sales trends.",0.3482143,0.989

We are seeing improvement based on our work to improve freshness and reliability as well as the work on value perception. In produce, we saw high single-digit comp increases in the second quarter driven by even stronger growth in organics. And in adult beverage, we saw ongoing double-digit comp growth driven by assortment and display enhancements we have been rolling out across the country. Importantly, we continue to build food and beverage expertise on our team. Following the hiring of Jeff Burt to lead food and beverage in merchandising at the end of the first quarter, we announced that we have hired two new members of his team earlier this week. Looking ahead, Japanese total team, are focused on building on recent momentum. We know we need to enhance our assortment of convenient options for our guests through this ready to eat, ready to heat or ready to cook and save families time and money.

Specifically, surveys are showing that consumers are noticing Target's investment in price and value and we saw a much stronger mix of regular price selling in the second quarter as we sort to simplify our promotions, clarify our voice and bring great price right daily items into focus. And it's working. In fact, our second quarter balance of regular and promotional sales was consistent with levels we haven't seen since 2012, well before our credit card data breach that changed our promotional cadence and stance.",0.9270833,0.965

Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"Also encouraging was the fact that our unit share in key categories grew more quickly in dollar share, which is a key leading indicator of the impact of this work. At a high level, our second quarter average ticket also reflects the impact of this work. At first glance, reporting a slight decline in average ticket might not sound like good news, but when it's more than offset by an increase in traffic, the picture is more positive. As we dig into the drivers, the change in basket reflected two key factors. The first was a reduction in general incentive offers, which were replaced with better daily value pricing and more category focused discounts. The second was a meaningful increase in the number of quick trips and fill-in trips we saw from our guests.",1.6676587,0.985

So, we are pleased to see our strategy taking hold and generating both trips and conversion. This work on value perception is about ensuring we are price-right daily on key items while delivering more thoughtful and effective promotions throughout our assortments. In many categories, this means we are reducing our everyday pricing and communicating with much more clarity building confidence among our guests.

We reduced out total inventory to last year by more than 4%, while improving the quality of our inventory by bringing unproductive inventory levels down to historical lows. The savings in markdowns through better sell through rates and lower inventory levels has created the capacity for us to invest in what's new and what's working which will position us well in the back half of the year.

In the second quarter our traffic sales and financial performance were all better than expected. Notably, the upside to our expectations was broad based across the country, across channels and in all three months of the quarter. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.3% driven by a traffic increase of 2.1%. We are particularly pleased to see this growth in traffic which reflects strong execution by our team and the early benefit of the work we are doing to transform our business. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.23 was flat to last year. GAAP EPS was $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting some small unfavorable tax items not related to our current operations.",0.7253116,0.961

This favorability was included in the adjusted EPS calculation, because it reflects a structural benefit to our tax rate resulting from our operations. The amount recorded in the second quarter reflects the year-to-date benefit of our global operations on our tax rate and we expect to recognize an ongoing benefit in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 in both the third and fourth quarters as well. Our second quarter gross margin rate was down about 40 basis points to last year, driven by increased fulfillment costs and the impact of our efforts to improve pricing and promotions.

This elective reclassification which resulted from an internal review of how we classify depreciation expense and discussions with the SEC during one of their routine reviews of our filings is reflected in our second quarter 2017 reporting. And we have reclassified prior year results as well.

Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"On the SG&A expense line we saw a year-over-year increase of about 50 basis points in the second quarter. This increase was driven by compensation costs reflecting the store labor investments that John highlighted earlier as well as higher bonus expense along with impairments related to anticipated store closures and our work to transform our supply chain. These costs were partially offset by the benefit of continued cost discipline throughout the organization. As I mentioned in one of our calls in 2016 for the last couple of years we have been working to create a culture of thoughtful cost discipline. And I am really pleased to see the ongoing benefit of that effort. I want to pause and thank the team both for their passion to transform our company and for their thoughtful cost management, which is helping to fund our investments in this transformation. At the end of the second quarter, our inventory was more than 4% lower than last year. This is vivid confirmation of the benefit of the work of both the operations and merchandising teams to reduce unproductive inventory and speed up our supply chain. These efforts are driving continued strong in stocks and sales growth on a smaller base of inventory.",0.3000959,0.989

The combined benefit of these two factors was an increase in our inventory leverage of more than 10 percentage points compared to last year. The working capital benefit of this leverage improvement is substantial and will provide additional cash to support our transformation. In fact, we are now forecasting 2017 cash flow from operations will be higher than last year despite the operating income reduction we have planed for the year.",0.3087248,0.967

We first invest capital into our business on projects that support our strategic and financial objectives. Second, we support our dividend and look to extend our record of raising the dividend annually since 1971. And finally, we repurchased our shares within the limits of our current single A credit ratings. In the second quarter, we devoted more than $700 million to capital investment, paid dividends in excess of $300 million and repurchased just under $300 million of our shares. For the year, we continued to expect that our CapEx will be in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range. However, with the increase in 2018 remodels Brian mentioned earlier, we now expect next year's CapEx will be $3 billion or more somewhat higher than our previous expectations.

As we look ahead, we will continue to move with urgency, but plan prudently. Of course, we are facing a tougher prior year comparison in the third quarter and we continue to expand the scope of our pricing and promotional work, which may create additional headwinds for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter comps will be within the range we established across the first two quarters of the year. For the full year, we expect that our comp will be in a range around plan plus or minus 1%. In the third quarter, we are planning for a declining event of approximately $230 million. More than half of this decline will be driven by D&A as we recognized accelerated depreciation related to the anticipated remodels we are planning for 2018. The remaining EBIT pressure will reflect this year's operating margin investments to support our transformation.

We have deployed that cash to fund capital investment of more than $1.2 billion. We returned nearly $1.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we have retired about $600 million of our long-term debt. As I said in our financial community meeting at the beginning of the year, we are so fortunate to have such a strong business and balance sheet, which allow us to invest while many of our peers are pulling back.

With regards to both third quarter, fourth quarter and full year we made our guidance as we said we will continue to move with urgency but plan prudently.

And so that's how I would think about the backside of full year. With regards to the reclassification we did on the supply chain depreciation expense, we posted a great schedule. John and the team posted today to the IR website gives you three full years by quarter. You can see but bottom line is 30 basis points to 40 basis points a quarter change.

Really wanted to simplify into one question all these different tests and get at one issue whether it's the world, the tests of curbside and same day whether it's the rollout of in-store, all the work you are doing, could you talk about all the new initiatives and is it - does it have more traction with existing customers, anything you can share existing customers capturing back more of their wallet or is it new customers that are new to Target as you go through these new initiatives?",,0.791
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,83,Answer,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"David, I would tell you it's the combination of both. And overall, we are very focused on improving the guest experience whether they are shopping in-store or online, making sure that we deepen the relationship with existing and new guests. And we are very pleased with the traffic increases we saw during the quarter. We are honestly very excited about the work that Mark and his team are doing around bringing new brands to our guests. And we have recognized that to move forward and to continue to execute, we have got to continue to make sure we are providing fulfillment options that our guests are looking for today. So as John talked about during our prepared comments, we are very focused right now on testing and expanding different fulfillment options. We have seen some very positive responses to think like Target Restock and we are going to continue to ensure that we can meet the needs of our guests no matter how they want to shop at Target.",0.3925501,0.983

Just as a sort of an add-on to that, one other things over the last decade that some retailers run into with all these attempts to reengage of a lot of which are very exciting is either overdoing it or over complicating it, how are you guarding against at the store level the associates not being overwhelmed by these initiatives and managing through that?",,0.739
TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,85,Answer,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It is a very important question and I am going to turn it over to John here to build on that. But we are trying to make sure we are very, very focused right now. And we have the guests in mind first that the initiatives that we are bringing forward are guest centered, but importantly that we have the right focus on execution each and every day. And I think what we saw in the second quarter is a byproduct of our focus on execution each and every day in our stores, online, in our supply chain and I think you are starting to see that focus really connect with the guests.",0.6835858,0.738

I think the key challenge there for us is to continue to take work that is not guests facing out of the store and guest facing work there like we study investments we are making in food and beverage and beauty, in visual merchandising, that includes things like order pickup and shipping from the store. But there are opportunities everywhere else to pull work out of the store and I think the stores teams have done a great job optimizing within the box. We need to continue to optimize upstream to help them take work out and that's a lot of testing we are doing today. I didn't talk a lot about it, but we have tests going on in multiple parts of the country, focused on taking work out of the store, so they can be focused on the guests.",0.8792468,0.959

Brian the - you guys have been mentioning the environment challenges and we are seeing very aggressive promotions out there in categories like apparel, your store traffic improved a lot this quarter, I am just curious are there - can you give us any color - are you picking up more share from competitor store closings than you would have thought? And then also as you shift more to EDLP while others are getting maybe more promotional, any insights from what you have seen so far in August that you can share with us on how all this is working out? And sorry just to add on this also and I don't know whether John Mulligan or Mark want to jump in on this, but as you pulled back up almost more you shift more to EDLP, can you remind us where things like cartwheel fit into that as you move forward and also how you see Red Card penetration playing out in your strategy?

TGT-2017-Q2-2017-08-16,91,Answer,2017-08-16,2,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Robby, there is 4 or 5 different questions there and we will try to un-bundle each of them. But as Mark talked about during his prepared comments during the second quarter, we saw very strong market share growth across a number of categories. We continue to see share growth in apparel, in home, in hardline and one of the things that I think we felt best about in the quarter and it's a byproduct of the work we have done from a promo standpoint as we continue to see our business in essentials shift back to regular price sales and the impact of our new marketing and advertising campaign, the Target Run and Done campaign, which has driven really positive reaction from the guests and accelerated our business in essentials. So, that was a real big highlight for us in the second quarter. And we have talked about this before. We are at our best when we balanced both style and household essentials and you are seeing that balance come to play in the second quarter and we certainly are going to continue that over the balance of the year and into 2018. So, it was a period of time where we felt good about the progress we are making as we pickup market share in many of our signature and style categories. We have seen growth in our essential businesses and we will build off of that as we go into the balance of 2017 and '18.",0.214081,0.992

So, Cartwheel remains a really viable promotional vehicle and gets engaging the tool for us. And what we are doing though in the simplification of our pricing messaging and creating great price right daily items is we are using Cartwheel, but we are reducing the amount of stock that's coming in and that's really helping us to clarify and simplify our message to the guests about what true everyday value is as well as what's an exceptional promotion.

And Jeff has already come in and begun start testing and iterating new ideas and concepts on top of our strategies that are creating growth vehicles. So, we are excited about that, the new people entering our business and just creating new strength against the strategic intent. So, firstly, Liz Nordlie will add value to own brand growth potential there and strengthen our efforts there as well as Mark Kenny, really with his expertise in general grocery but specifically in the convenient meal area and in bakery etcetera. I mean, that is part of our ongoing strategic intent to strengthen and focus there. So, these are key investments in our strategy and in our team balancing them against existing talent.

The only question I have essentially just on the pick for store concept, I just want to share a comment we had from an industrial engineer that was working for mew a long time ago that it's about as efficient as a driver who takes three rides to take a left. There is massive cost when you have people walk the store instead of being your customers and walk it back out on a simulated basis. I get incrementally. I get that you don't have to have the checkout cost and that offsets a little bit. Is there something that's coming that you guys are confident on the operational side that will make you pick from store the way you guys are doing it better than lots of other folks, so that we don't face as much of efficiency?

I think anytime you focus on just one slice of the total fulfillment, you lose picture for the whole thing right, we are trying to optimize the total economics for Target and those economics include investments, capital investments we might otherwise have to make if we don't utilize the existing assets. So, I think we can point to any one slice and say this was going to be better or worse, but again we are optimizing total economic picture and I'd have you think about that. I think the remodels where they will really help us and it's in conjunction with us taking inventory out of the backroom is our ability to optimize that backroom more efficiently to drive more productivity as we shift from the store.

So our promotional efforts are really rolled through the quarter even. And we began them in first quarter in April and a second round of taking key items that comprise our guest basket and focusing on priced right daily items really took hold and then second wave in - by the end of July. The next round of that is through October and that's when we will be coming together to have a more concise in-store marketing campaign and regular cadence of new ways to the guest to communicate value. So we think at that point that we have a strong base to maintain and this is why in half two we have been prudent in how we forecasted our sales and margin based on also unit growth initially.

Aggregating all of these benefits, our second quarter average unit costs for digital fulfillment, was approximately 30% lower than a year ago. This provided a significant offset to the cost pressure we would otherwise be seeing from our unusually high rate of digital sales growth.",0.2292264,0.785

Specifically among our new digital guests in the first quarter, we've seen nearly double the rate of repeat purchases within seven days compared with a year ago.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, I want to spend a minute talking about our current inventory levels and in stock performance. While we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, we are still facing challenges across multiple parts of our assortment, driven by a couple of distinct factors. First, in many of our frequency categories, our vendors continue to face capacity constraints as they work to accommodate unexpectedly high demand across the U.S. While these vendors continue to ramp up production and we have been successful in negotiating higher allocations for many of them, demand in our stores continues to outpace supply as a result on-shelf availability in many of these categories continues to look sparse. Even as our allocation quantities are increasing. We will continue to work with our vendor partners to make more progress in the back half of the year.",0.4044208,0.84

Based on our current plans, we expect that our import inventory will reach last year's levels by the end of the third quarter, and should expand well beyond last year's levels in the fourth quarter. And finally, I want to address the nagging questions we continue to hear regarding our capacity and ability to further scale our store based fulfillment model. I have addressed this question multiple times in prior earnings calls. And I would think that our recent results would dispel these worries. But we clearly haven't convinced everyone yet. So we'll continue to provide facts to support our modeling.",0.1792878,0.944

Of our six plus billion dollars in comparable sales growth so far this year, conventional store sales have grown nearly $2 billion, while digital sales have expanded more than $4 billion.

Sales from our pickup and drive up services have also grown more than $1.6 billion so far this year, with drive up accounting for well over $1 billion of that growth.

It has been incredibly gratifying to watch how our team has adapted to unprecedented change, serving consumers in record numbers while staying laser focused on what matters most, the safety of our guests, and our fellow team members. While we all can't wait for the day when we can look at this pandemic in the rearview mirror, the reality is that it's not likely to end soon.

Among the tailwinds to gross margin, we saw about 180 basis points of rates benefit from core merchandising strategies, which played out most prominently in lower markdown rates compared with last year. In addition, we saw about 50 basis points of benefit from the change in the sales return reserve estimate that we held at the beginning of the quarter.

On very strong comp sales growth of nearly 18% in the first half of 2020, our operating margin rate is about 30 basis points lower than last year, reflecting meaningful pressure on the gross margin line, mostly offset by rate improvements on both the SG&A and D&A expense lines.

As a result, through the first half of the year, we've generated cash from operations of about $5.1 billion, which is $2.3 billion higher than last year. The largest driver of this favorability is our inventory leverage, which was well above 100% at the end of the quarter.

However, given the dynamics of remodel projects, we're maintaining our revised plan to complete about 130 remodels this year, well below last year and our original plan.

Even though we report this metric on a trailing 12-month basis, it has been unusually volatile this year, given the dramatic changes in performance we've seen, specifically at the end of the first quarter this metric was nearly four percentage points lower than today at 13.4%, driven by the steep profit decline we faced in the first quarter.

However, I want to reinforce what I was just saying earlier, which is that we are moving through a period of unusually high uncertainty and volatility. And while John was correct that we felt a much stronger sense of normalcy in the second quarter, volatility continued to be elevated, specifically within the second quarter May was by far the strongest month with a 33% comp, followed by June at 21%, in July at about 20%.

But a 20 percentage points spread between our May and August today comps is an incredibly wide swing within a few months, highlighting the difficulty of forecasting our business right now. So given that our Q1 performance was not a good predictor of our second quarter results, our Q2 results should not be viewed as a predictor of our performance going forward. And given that we can't eliminate uncertainty in the environment, we continue to place a premium on flexibility in our plants this will allow us to quickly pivot when we see changes in our business, as you've seen us do successfully multiple times this year.",0.6152272,0.831

That confidence springs from the fact that we continue to focus on investing for the long-term because Target's long-term prospects have never been brighter. We have a durable business model with flexibility in both our merchandising assortment and the fulfillment options we offer.

I don't want to take away from the success of the quarter because it obviously was outstanding, but I do want to focus on gross margin. Because I know while it's impossible to predict what things will look like on the top-line, I think we probably have a pretty good handle on SG&A in terms of how that will look obviously, depending on sales, but gross margin kind of in the back half seems to be a little more of a wild card. So wondering if you could talk about that a little bit and I think in the context, that 180 basis points in rate benefits from lower markdowns, because presumably you had marked down things, you pre-marked down in 1Q and you're benefiting from that in 2Q.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"To focus for a second on where we've been, I actually think it's useful to zoom out and look at the year-to-date trends. If you unpack margin on a year-to-date basis, we've got just over a point of pressure from the accelerated growth in digital and supply chain investments and just over a point of pressure in category mix. And you've got a wide variety of movement across the markdown -- some of the markdowns we took in Q1 with [indiscernible] slower and then the benefit of more sales at reg price in Q2 and an example of that Karen is really you think about how the sell through we're getting given our strong sales, we're taking a lot less product to clearance at the end of the season than we would typically. And so that's an example of one of those drivers of favorability that contributes to the 180 basis points, a good news in Q2.",0.2406877,0.883

Karen, I'd say the great thing is, is that from a behavior perspective, they behave just like the rest of our guests. When we convert someone to a drive up order historically, we've seen them become more engaged with Target, see 30% more sales. That's exactly what we see with this 10%. Probably more encouraging from our perspective is that from a repeat purchase perspective, we've seen that increase seven day repeat purchases are higher than we've seen, historically, 90-day repeat purchases on digital are higher than we have seen historically. So it appears that at least to start with, they're much more engaged with us.

And we continue to see stickiness as store guest discovers drive up or discovers the benefits of ship and also digital guests are now coming into our stores because the investments we've made and the trust we're building.

I was just curious on the August comp, obviously impressive results, quarter-to-date, given stimulus rolling off back-to-school, I was hoping that you provide a little bit of category color in terms of what you're seeing in August? And then as it relates to back to school, I guess, what are your thoughts on how the season is going to end up, I mean, obviously, we're getting off to a late start in a lot of areas. Just curious as to what you think the impact to the comp will end up being this quarter.",1.5359477,0.912
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,117,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I commented earlier today that our August comps are off to a very solid start with low to mid teen growth at this point in the month, and it's been broad based. So we're continuing to see the kind of performance we saw in the second quarter, continue into Q3, strength in food and essentials, continued strength in electronics, continued strength in home. And certainly we've seen some adjustments in categories that are very school related as consumers look for greater certainty around when they're going to start the back-to-school season. But I think again, the most important indicator right now as I look at our August performance, is the consistent market share growth that we're seeing across our entire portfolio. And each and every week as we look at IRI and MTD performance, we continue to see a lot of green boxes and continue to pick up market share across the board and across our entire multi-category portfolio.",0.3860008,0.975
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,118,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Obviously, we're all looking at back-to-school and back-to-college trends and each and every day there's new information. As we sit here today and I think the number is something close to 56 million students in the K-12 brackets that are waiting to go back-to-school. And as of this week, it looks like well over 60% will start school remotely. And we'll look for more information. We don't know if those students will be welcomed back into a classroom in September or October. Many may wait actually until January. So we've made the decision to be flexible. And we'll extend the season and extend our assortment because we know at some point in time those students will need backpacks and uniforms. They're going to need school supplies. So we're going to make sure that we continue to flex and I think it's been the hallmark of our performance throughout the first two quarters of this year. Our ability to stay agile, stay flexible, meet the needs of the new environment and we'll continue to take that approach with back-to-school season and with the back-to-college environment as well.",0.5088007,0.945

We're certainly preparing to start earlier than ever before. In the October period, we're going to make some big changes. We announced recently that we'll be closed on Thanksgiving. And we certainly expect it's going to be a different rhythm to the shopping season. Obviously, we're going to put a big premium on ease and convenience delivering great value, but will emphasize safety. And we'll also make sure that our guests knows that those top items and that great value is going to be available throughout the season.

We think it plays well to our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores and our convenient same day offering. So we'll prepare for a very different holiday season. We'll have to stay nimble, we'll have to adjust. But again, I think the team has demonstrated the flexibility and the adaptability to this new environment.

And then second is, obviously the same day services are quite robust. I'm just curious, what are some of the learnings that you have over the last few months as it relates to order pick up, drive up and ship? And how are these businesses therefore evolving and improving from these learnings?",0.5636512,0.903
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,124,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Paul, when I start and I'll go back to our comments during our first quarter call, we certainly saw literally starting in the middle of April, a resurgence of traffic to our stores, and that certainly continued in the second quarter. So I commented earlier today when I was speaking with CNBC that despite the tremendous top-line growth at 24.3% and digital growing at almost 200% during the quarter. The real star of our performance was the performance we saw in stores, where our store comps were up 10.9% despite an environment where we've seen unprecedented digital shopping. So we certainly saw that guest returning to store throughout the second quarter. And that was consistent from May into June and July. And we continue to see guests shop our stores and I think the investments we've made in safety, the investments we've made in our team, the investments we've been making for years and years putting capital into remodeling our stores and a great shopping environment. That's certainly connecting with the guests during the pandemic.",0.3970528,0.957
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,125,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we continue to see very strong store traffic. We saw excellent traffic overall during the quarter up almost 5% and John can comment on similar learnings from our same day fulfillment. I will tell you, I think the biggest learning is just how adaptable and flexible our teams have been and how quickly they've responded to a surge in something like drive up that grew over 700% during the quarter alone.",0.3213262,0.866

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Paul, I think Brian hit right on probably the core learning is the ability of our team to be incredibly agile and we went in a matter of weeks from normal digital sales to volumes that exceeded Q4 last year, for many weeks in a row. So the ability of our teams to do that very quickly were typically planning for Q4 takes us several months, we have a detailed plan, but the team's understood what we were doing, how they needed to execute. The tools that the store teams have built to help them execute proved very scalable and very efficient. And so our ability to do that was outstanding.",0.0622186,0.961
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,127,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other side of that, I would say again, to point to how well the teams executed while taking care of the guests in the store, as Brian pointed out, our NPS scores remained very, very high the entire time. Drive up growing over 700% and still having an NPS score in excess of 80 is just outstanding work by our teams.",0.3442489,0.875
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,128,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think the last thing that it kind of changed our thoughts on, the thing we've worried about, not only worried being -- not quite the right word, but thought about a lot is the stores are busy are in Q4 serving guests in-store. And so how do we continue to balance that with our fulfillment and what we've seen over the past three months is, that's not a problem as long as we give them the right tools, staff the stores appropriately, we can take care of running a 10 comp in the stores and running 20 comp on digital both of those together. And so we feel really good about the model we built in the team and built over the past several years. And I think that's probably the biggest learning over the past three months.",0.3737208,0.883
TGT-2020-Q2-2020-08-19,129,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'd add only one other detail and I think it's a tribute to John's leadership and the quality of the store and supply chain teams. In Q1, we noted that we had turned off our plans to expand, pick up and drive up to include fresh and frozen food and beverage products. We've turned that back on. And the team recognized that that was very important to our guests, it was going to continue to be important as we went in the second half of the year. And despite the unprecedented same day growth and the demand we've seen for drive up and pick up, the team has put that back on the roadmap. And we're now expanding that across the country. And to me, that just points to the further upside opportunity we have with our same day services. So again, a big tribute to the team, the leadership they provided to recognize that that was going to be important to our guests and as opposed to waiting until 2021. We're going to get that back on our roadmap and begin to stand up those capabilities in the second half of the year. And I think that's going to be just one more aspect that will be appreciated by our guests when they shop Target in the third and fourth quarter.",0.0650839,0.944

So my question actually is for you, I want to take the supply chain from a different angle.

And, I would start in a place where demand forecasting is difficult right now. Both for us and we import a lot of our goods, as you know, directly and from -- for our vendors who have long lead times as well. I think the thing we're working on with them is, we would call it joint business planning, just being sure we're both aligned, and that we've built flexibility and agility into what we want to do. There are ways you can set up sourcing strategies, we do this where we get an initial set order, and then we have very quick ways we can chase into demand through other avenues if we need to.",0.1620958,0.765

So to me, this is mostly about conversations and then agility and being flexible when we see the data coming in because it is moving rapidly. And we know when we write -- we talk about it, we write down a forecast the only thing we know is that it is wrong.

And in many cases, skill optimization, learning how to do more with less. And we've partnered closely with some of our key vendors to make sure that we're focused on getting the top selling items into our store and into our system. And we made some adjustments in a few rationalization along the way. So I think out of the pandemic, I think we've learned that we can do a lot more with your SKUs in certain categories. We've got to focus on the most important items that are in demand with our guests.

And I'll start and I will certainly let Michael and John also jump in. So I think as we think about our strategy from an assortment standpoint, I'll go back to something we've talked about for years now. We're at our best when we're a curator, and balancing a curated assortment of our own brands, and great national brands. And I think you'll continue to see that focus from Target going forward. And as I think about the work and the great work that our merchants have done, it all comes down to being great curators and they've done that both with our in-store and our online assortment. I think that is a huge point of difference for us. It's served us well. It allows us to meet the growing demand in the digital channel.

We're inviting people in. It's an invitation only platform.

We continue to see strength in our stores and our digital channel. We continue to grow market share and see momentum within our business. So we'll watch it carefully, obviously as Michael and John have stated several times, it's a very challenging environment for us to provide guidance. We've got the pandemic in front of us. We've got uncertainty about back-to-school, back-to-college, the state of the economy. We do have an election coming up in November. So lots of different dynamics that we have to try to sort through.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"My follow up question is that you've provided a lot of helpful statistics about how the average unit cost to fulfill an online order is now 30% below last year, because the digital growth is so strong, that that led to 130 basis points or gross margin pressure. So if we assume that some of the incremental sales that you're generating right now recede when consumers go back to travelling and eating out. And yet consumers have really gravitated to these digital fulfillment options like in-store pick up and drive up and those stick around in that physical penetration remains where it is, should we think that this gross margin pressure of about 100, 130 basis points sticks? Or do you have offsets on the horizon that can reduce that pressure?",0.3794515,0.631

I think that well, we don't know exactly what those numbers will look like for the back half of the year. So I'm not going to attempt to predict those. I think what you see in the first half of the year is the durability of the model overall. And as you've heard us say many times that growth in digital is way bigger to us than just the sales or profit on that one digital transaction because it deepens our relationship with the guests. And that pays off in spending in aggregate. And I think as you can see, evidence of the how that flows through the durability of the model even in the first half of this year, I missed all the volatility, if you would have told me before this year, that digital would be up over almost 200% on the year, and that we would have had a point or more of pressure in gross margin from category mix. But that our operating income rate would be within 30 basis points of the year prior, I'd have taken that outcome in a heartbeat.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Our traffic growth, up 3.7%, is the strongest we've seen in more than 10 years, reflecting healthy increases in both our stores and digital channels.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This demonstrates the benefits of maintaining a balanced portfolio as strength in these categories offset the impact of a late spring on our temperature-sensitive categories, which have accelerated dramatically as we entered the second quarter.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"At the beginning of the year, we rolled out free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com with no annual fee.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"While Shipt is our most common way to deliver same day, we're also rapidly rolling out a distinct version of same-day delivery to stores located in dense metro areas.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,39,Remarks,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C.

Store shopping remains very important and will continue to be so in the future, but it's no longer the only way people choose to shop. So, for both our physical assets and our people, we are modernizing how we work, which includes a meaningful investment to continue providing the best of what physical shopping means today. At the same time, we are reorganizing virtually everything we do to ensure we provide convenience, speed and reliability in all the ways that our guests want to shop.",0.0045027,0.935

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Across our supply chain, we're testing and rolling out new processes designed to make us faster, more nimble, more accurate, and reliable.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Out of stocks on items in the store served by the Perth Amboy facility have been running about 40% lower than our previous benchmark. These results were accomplished by applying a new inventory positioning logic, developed by our data and analytics team that allows us to send the right quantity in the right unit measure much faster than our other facilities.",0.1268932,0.178

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,45,Remarks,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,48,Remarks,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And while we're on the topic of inventory, I want to address our total inventory position at the end of the quarter, which reflects the strategic positioning I just mentioned.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,50,Remarks,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And finally, this year's calendar shift resulted in some early back-to-school and back-to-college receipts being reflected in our first quarter, which weren't recognized until second quarter last year. Bottom-line, we feel very good about our inventory level, which positions us for accelerating growth and market share gains in the second quarter and beyond.",1.3012689,0.855

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,53,Remarks,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But there's much more to our efforts to expand our digital fulfillment capabilities and provide new, convenient options for our guests. In the first quarter, when we launched free two-day shipping on Target.com, we saw an immediate increase in the number of orders, basket size, units, and sales.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"By the holiday season, we expect to have this service available from a vast majority of our stores in well over 40 states.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to Shipt, we continue to be pleased with the rollout of our other same-day delivery service in dense urban areas, which we refer to as from store same-day delivery.

I was wondering if we could start with just traffic, the best traffic that I've probably seen in my career. And it's also the best traffic -- one of the best traffic results probably across the retail industry. Could you help us parse out the strength that you're seeing there? Because you have a lot of things going on right now, is Drive-Up having a material benefit? Is Shipt having a material benefit?

Partially why the traffic number is so impressive is you're doing some major remodels that I would assume are taking a lot of stores down and pretty much out of commission, right? So, can you help me think about the negative impact from remodels this year now that you've done 50 and you're going into another 100 into this quarter? Is that in line with your expectations?

Obviously, there is a disruption during the construction period. But our team is getting better and better at minimizing the disruption, accelerating the remodel time frame.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,178,Question,2018-05-23,1,2018,Seth Sigman,Credit Suisse,"Hey guys. Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-up questions here on the margins. Aside from the mix, as we're looking at, I guess, first, the price investments you've been making, remind us when do you actually cycle fully those price investments? And regular price was up $1 billion, I think, you said year-over-year, which seems pretty meaningful. Should we interpret that as the biggest changes are done and you feel pretty good about the value proposition, and we could see that benefit as you move through the year?",,0.96
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,179,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Mark J. Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"Yes, Seth, Mark here. Thanks. What we're seeing is a cycle over our LY. We really were starting to implement price changes right at the very end of Q2 leading through Q3 and really maturing through Q4.",0.0694444,0.873
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,180,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Mark J. Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"So, we're still in an evolutionary process, and we start to see that balance out by Q3. So, there's some benefits again into the mix and private value to LY still in Q2 with stability going from Q3 onwards.",0.281746,0.862
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,181,Question,2018-05-23,1,2018,Seth Sigman,Credit Suisse,"Okay, that's helpful. And then on the digital and fulfillment cost, part of the outlook, I think, included the benefit from more ship from store to mitigate some of the cost pressures. Can you update us on that, give us a sense of the impact that fulfillment may have had on gross margin this quarter? And is that also something you expect to improve through the year?",,0.677
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,182,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, I think nothing new here, really. Digital fulfillment sales have put pressure on gross margin as that continues to grow faster than the rest of the business. But on the other side of that, as you pointed out, as we continue to ship more from our stores, that is the, first, the fastest way to ship for our guest; and second, it's the most efficient from a cost perspective for us.",2.0503479,0.126
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,183,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the other thing I would point to is when we introduce things like two-day shipping, we see lift in units as well. And so as we increase units, the cost per unit to fulfill goes down dramatically.",0.9119935,0.843
TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,184,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,185,Answer,2018-05-23,1,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so that's one thing.

TGT-2018-Q1-2018-05-23,188,Question,2018-05-23,1,2018,Gregory Melich,MoffettNathanson,"Hi, thanks. I really had a bigger-picture question maybe to help frame the great traffic results, but also for the cost involved. So, I think if we look at EBIT dollars were down 10% in the first quarter and you have this best traffic in years. But given the investments you made last year, it sounds like by the back half, to get to your guidance, EBIT dollar should be going up mid-single-digit.

So, the first 13 weeks of this quarter were the first 13 weeks and just kind of roll that out.

If you think about it, given this surge in traffic and you think about a few years out, if you could keep the traffic up here, would you be willing to let the margin rate continue to slip to, I guess, around 6% now to 5% if that's what it took to keep this sort of traffic number?

So, I just -- not to beat a dead horse here on the comp cadence, but I'm getting lots of e-mails, so I figured I'd do one more.

So, we have food people who know the Food business, and they are accountable for the totality of that business. They do the restock. They do intraday restocking. They own price change. They own everything that goes on in that business.

So if we just focus on the quarter, your sales and EPS came in at about the midpoint, but your EBIT margin was below guidance. Seems like it was mostly gross margin, but just hoping that you can elaborate on what was different versus your expectations. And then as you think about the EBIT margin implied for the fourth quarter, I think you said down slightly, Cathy, so it seems to be down a lot less than the third quarter, maybe even up at the high-end of the range for the year. So just curious, what is different in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter? Thanks.",,0.917

I think as we look at our absolute performance in the third quarter, we were right on our expectations. We continue to have another very strong quarter where traffic grew over 5%. We had very strong overall comp performance of 5.1%, an acceleration versus the first half of the year. We delivered digital growth of 49%, our strongest growth rate ever. And we did grow EPS by over 20%, while growing market share in every one of our major categories.",0.014736,0.953
TGT-2018-Q3-2018-11-20,100,Answer,2018-11-20,3,2018,Brian C.

We're seeing a very strong response to our store remodels. Our new small formats are performing very well in each and every market. We continue to drive very strong performance with our new owned brands. And the investments we're making in our team are driving exceptional responses from the guests. So as we look at our performance in the quarter, we're right where we expected to be and we're set up well for a very strong holiday season. Cathy?",0.1412198,0.956

So Seth, as we said, we expect a small rate decline in the fourth quarter. First off, we expect 5% comp, so we just start there, and then a small rate decline in the quarter. And as you said, we pointed to - we do expect continued pressure in gross margin, but not to the same extent we saw in Q3. The biggest difference is our - while we still expect great sales, we obviously already anticipate the mix that we'll be seeing in that business, just like we did last year's fourth quarter.",0.3005753,0.844

And then just, Brian, you highlighted a number of positives particularly on the sales line. And there are clearly cost to achieve that, right, and drive that higher share that you're seeing. So can you just help us better understand some of the initiatives to help offset those cost pressures that you alluded to earlier? I'm not sure if those are already in play, if they're already happening, but just help us better understand when that can have a more meaningful impact and support that profitable earnings growth that you were talking about earlier?

Those will take place over time. We've also rolled out a number of new fulfillment options. And while we know that throughout the year, Ship to home is very important to our guest, as we continue to build awareness around other fulfillment options, order in line pickup in-store, our new Drive-Up capabilities in almost 1,000 locations, our Restock program, as well as our membership program through Shipt.

If I get a one quick follow-up, just on SG&A clearly, you're still making a lot of investments, but you're starting to lap a lot of investments on acceleration of investment that you're making. I'm talking specific to wages. As we see comp store sales remain in pretty strong territory, especially given your very strong traffic, is it possible that as we get into early 2019 that we could start to see a little bit more of leverage from some of the strength in comps if it stays?",,0.971

We think having the best team in Retail is really important, so we'll keep making those investments on our path to $15 by 2020 as we said. But what you saw with us being essentially flat this quarter is that we are starting to find some of those offsets. And to your point, we'll continue.

Cathy, I wanted to just follow-up on the gross margin fee. I think the expectation was that they'd be up in the back half, and I think you guys have said stronger in the 4Q than 3Q. As we look at the fourth quarter, in the gross margin being down less than it was in the third quarter, maybe a little bit more color on what the - maybe the fourth quarter digital growth assumption is? And sort of what changes - is it basically that the pressure from bringing all the inventory into the third quarter alleviates in the fourth quarter?

To your point, we knew that we have a lot of cost of goods sold initiative that'll start to come through back half of this year, which are exactly doing what we said. The strength of digital at 46% this quarter, on top of last year's in the 24 range is a pretty big change. So that is some of the pressure you're seeing in Q3. When we move into Q4, we did a 29 digital comp last year in the fourth quarter, and so we're anticipating still strong fourth quarter digital comp as you'd expect.",0.3202301,0.904

We clearly were planning well ahead for a very strong fourth quarter. We wanted to make sure we had the inventory in our system to meet the very strong demand we're anticipating for the fourth quarter. And there's really no update on the overall tariff front. We continue to watch it each and every day, as I know you do. And we're looking at what levers we can pull to make sure we minimize the impact for our guest. So we'll watch it very carefully.

We certainly have been talking for several years now about the opportunities that are in the market as many of our competitors shrink or liquidate and go out of business.

Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Maybe I'll start, if it's okay, Ed, with the new - the small formats, and then John maybe can add into the inventory question. So on small formats, yes, first off, we really like that we're able to access guest that haven't had access to Target in the past. And so that has been terrific. We continue to like what we're seeing out of the small stores, they have great sales productivity as we referenced in the call earlier. And we do see really good returns. So we measure them against the same IRRs, and the same hurdle rates we do all of our investment, and they have really good returns. So we'll continue to see that.

There's been some businesses we've chased into. Like Toys, we have aggressively chased into. And Baby, which have the result of what's going on in the marketplace there. But I wouldn't describe our inventory ever as light. I think we were well positioned at the end of the second quarter. We feel really good about our position right now. We knew we would peak inventories relatively early given when Black Friday falls this year. And of course, you saw that on our third quarter balance sheet.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if we go back to the new small format, I think it's important to point out, this is allowing us to reach a guest that in the past we hadn't been able to serve. So when you think about the recent quarter and approximately 60 bps of revenue contributed by these new small formats, that's largely incremental. These are neighborhoods and catchments where we haven't been participating before. It's a guest that wasn't able to shop with Target on a regular basis. So not only are they already contributing to our revenue, it's opening up a door for our new guest to shop at Target. And the reaction, as Cathy has referenced, has been very positive. We're seeing incredible productivity out of these stores, and we are reaching a guest in neighborhoods where we've never completed before.",0.985264,0.765

So we did see - I'm not sure. So let me just address the third quarter gross margin. As we said, it was obviously lower than we had anticipated or the deterioration was. Really, the biggest piece of that is the supply chain costs related to the digital fulfillment to support that 49% comp. The next biggest piece of it is really around the supply chain cost to process, receive and process the inventory ahead of the holiday.

We did move a lot of inventory in second quarter, and we did it at a higher cost. Do you guys all know there's transportation pressure out there? Our first and foremost objective is it relate to transportation was ensuring that we secure the supply we would need to move our goods. And so we did that. And we will find ways to offset that incremental cost through other ways as we go forward. But we're moving a lot of inventory, and it was at a higher rate than we paid last year.

TGT-2018-Q3-2018-11-20,170,Answer,2018-11-20,3,2018,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes. So I would think more of a normalized - think about a new statutory rate with the Federal tax reform is probably a better place. So if you just take the third quarter, we obviously on print was 13.6% tax rate, which is incredible. I'll stop there. But if you take out the adjustment we made to the previous deferred, we would have been closer to a 19-ish range or so.

We're only reporting our revenue, which, of course, is quite modest relative to the GMCs - GMV sales that go through Shipt. So the impact there is relatively modest, but we're very excited with Shipt the opportunity now is to begin testing Shipt deliveries on target.com and the opportunity to scale that next year.",0.8018829,0.914

TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,9,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. We are really pleased with our third quarter financial results, which were well ahead of our expectations on nearly every measure. Comparable sales grew 4.5% in the quarter, about a point ahead of our guidance, driven by an acceleration of sales in our source. This comp performance is on top of 5.1% in last year's third quarter, meaning that we've grown our comparable sales nearly 10% over the last two years. Third quarter profitability was also stronger than expected, driven by a much larger than expected increase in our gross margin rate. With this upside, operating margin dollars increased more than 22% compared with a year ago, resulting in a nearly 25% increase in adjusted EPS.",1.011052,0.953
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,10,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In light of this performance and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS expectations by $0.30. This reflects really strong performance, well ahead of our expectations going into 2019. And it demonstrates the power of the durable, operational and financial model we've been developing over the last several years. None of these results would be possible without the amazing efforts of our team, who have designed and implemented meaningful changes across multiple parts of our business, from our store service and operating model to our unmatched digital fulfillment capabilities, and our inventory replenishment routines.",0.8714695,0.597
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,11,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And while there's much more to do, it's incredibly gratifying to see how these efforts are already driving outstanding operational and financial performance. When we analyze the components of our comp sales, we're pleased that traffic continues to be the primary driver of our growth. Overall, our traffic grew 3.1% in the third quarter, as our guests chose to shop with us more often, both in stores and through our digital options. Among our sales channels, store comps were up 2.8% in the quarter, more than 1 percentage point faster than the second quarter, while digital comps grew 31% and drove 1.7 percentage points of the Company's comp growth.",0.731887,0.94
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,12,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Notably, this year's digital growth was on top of a 49% comp increase last year. While these numbers add up to 80%, when you're talking about growth rates of this magnitude, the power of compounding really matters. Specifically, when you do the math, you'll see that our third quarter digital comp sales have actually grown more than 95% over the last two years. Within our digital sales, 80% of our third quarter growth was driven by same-day fulfillment options, in-store Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt. Given that these same-day options rely on our store assets, team and inventory, they are much more profitable than traditional ecommerce fulfillment.",0.4420794,0.935

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As we look back at trends within the quarter, we continue to see the benefit of our balanced multi-category assortment, which gives us the flexibility to lean into different seasons and important moments in our guests' lives. At the beginning of the quarter, we enjoyed favorable results in our back-to-school and back-to-college assortment. And later in the quarter, as colder weather spread across the country, we saw a rapid acceleration in sales of our weather-sensitive categories.",0.8354482,0.912
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,14,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond these seasonal moments, we continue to benefit from our frequency categories. Food and beverage, essentials and beauty, which drive everyday traffic, guess engagement and sales. We're happy to see continued broad market share gains across many of our core merchandising categories. Apparel saw the most dramatic share gains in the quarter, with comp sales growth of more than 10%. This was driven by even stronger trends in jewelry, accessories and shoes, intimates and sleepwear, young contemporary and women's ready to wear.",0.9242734,0.981
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,15,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In the home category, which was annualizing really strong growth a year ago, we saw a low-single-digit comp increase in the third quarter, driven by strength in the kitchen and home storage categories. Among our frequency categories, we continue to benefit from amazing strength in beauty and cosmetics, which delivered high-single-digit comp growth in the quarter. We also saw high-single-digit growth in our over the counter assortment, and mid-single-digit growth in household essentials and paper products.",0.7511257,0.987
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,16,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Within our hardline categories, we saw particular strength in mobile and continued growth in toys, offset by comp sales decline in electronics and entertainment. And finally, in food and beverage categories, we saw low-single-digit comp increase, led by double-digit growth in adult beverages, along with strength in non-alcoholic beverages and in our bakery and deli areas.",1.1481785,0.94

The idea behind the brand is simple: Great food made for real life. Good & Gather incorporates simple, high quality ingredients without any artificial flavors, synthetic colors, artificial sweeteners, or high fructose corn syrup. We saw encouraging results from our launch of 650 items during the quarter and expect that Good & Gather will become our largest owned brand, once we roll out the full 2,000-item assortment by the end of next year.",0.473598,0.956

Early in the third quarter, we announced the new creative collaboration with Disney, designed to bring the magic of Disney to the joy of shopping at Target. We launched 25 Disney stores within select Target locations last month, featuring an immersive experience and an enhanced Disney assortment of more than 450 items, including more than 100 items that were previously available only at Disney retail locations. Beyond those markets, we offer this extended assortment to all of our guests through the Disney store on target.com, and the Target app. We'll expand this collaboration to another 40 locations with a Disney shop-in-shop in 2020.

As I mentioned last quarter, our stores have now fully rolled out a new operating model across the chain. This new model is oriented around our guests, not our own tasks, including the creation of dedicated store teams with overall business ownership in key categories like beauty, apparel, home, electronics and food and beverage. The key to this new model is to continue delivering efficiency when accomplishing tasks, but to orient team goals around guests and business outcomes rather than merely checking off a box on a to do list. The rollout of this model has involved a major evolution in the culture of how we run our stores. But, we've been really pleased with the results we've been seeing so far.

And this year with six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, our guests may find themselves with even less time than usual. These are the times that are same-day services can feel like a lifesaver. Guests can place an order and our team will have it ready at the front of the store or in the parking lot in less than an hour, or if a guest wants their order delivered to their home, they can request same-day delivery and one of more than 100,000 ship shoppers will deliver their order at the front door in an hour or two.",0.7322964,0.957

We've been rapidly rolling out Drive Up and Shipt across the country for the last couple of years and Order Pick Up has been available in all of our stores for more than five years.

Target sales volume fulfilled by Shipt grew more than 100%, and Drive Up, our highest rated service, saw astounding growth of more than 500%. Obviously, a portion of the growth for Drive Up was driven by the addition of more than 800 locations, compared with a year ago. But more than half of the growth occurred in mature locations, as more and more guests in those markets tried the service, loved it and chose to use it again and again.",0.8276709,0.963

And given that we've already been seeing rapid growth in the sales penetration of these services all year, we are planning for them to play a really important role in the fourth quarter. We've made dedicated investments in hours, training, tools and fixtures to prepare our stores to accommodate a meaningful spike in volume of the same-day options during the holidays, while still maintaining the service standards that make them so popular. But, we aren't just focused on enhancing our digital capabilities. As I pointed out before, even in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our sales still occur in our stores.

We opened seven small format locations in the third quarter, plus another six in November, and sales from this year's entire group of new stores are running ahead of our plan. We plan to continue opening about 30 of these smaller stores per year because they drive guest engagement and deliver strong financial performance, including much higher than average sales productivity and meaningfully higher gross margin rates compared with our larger format stores.

The benefits of this new system include lower backroom inventory levels, better on shelf availability of our store inventory, and a higher percentage of replenished items that flow straight to the shelf. We've been developing this system over the last couple of years, and we've been ramping up the percent of our assortment being managed by this new system. It's currently active on approximately 15% of our assortment, representing 20% to 30% of total replenishment that flows to our stores.

In many ways, we are still early in the journey. But that doesn't mean there's been a small amount of effort. We've designed and are now implementing comprehensive changes to how we move product, how we replenish our store inventory, how we operate our stores, how we interact with our guests, and how we fulfill their digital orders. Any of these changes in isolation will be big. But, when you put them all together, it's been an incredible effort. In the face of challenges, I've seen our team respond with passion, enthusiasm and seemingly endless energy to move from theory to reality.

This increase reflected the retiming of both marketing expenses and store labor from the second quarter, driven primarily by the October launch of Target Circle. Year-to-date, our SG&A expense rate has improved about 30 basis points from last year.

And I first want to briefly reiterate those priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest capital and projects to meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support our dividend, and seek to extend the Company record of annual increases in dividend per share something we've accomplished every year since 1971.

In 2021 and beyond, we expect to moderate the pace of our remodels to a range of about 150 to 200 stores per year.

However, given that this inventory position was about 8% higher than two years ago, the year-over-year decline is largely a reflection of the specific inventory investments we made in advance of the fourth quarter last year. As we approach this year's peak season, we feel very good about both the level and makeup of our inventory, which should position us to extend the strong sales and earnings performance we've seen so far this year.",0.3352436,0.802

Through the first three quarters of the year, our operations have generated more than $4.1 billion in cash, up more than $500 million from the same period last year. We have deployed that cash along with a portion of our cash on hand at the beginning of the year, to fund $2.4 billion of CapEx, paid just under $1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $900 million of our shares.",0.3585755,0.778

This measure can be helpful as you evaluate the quality of the Company's business model and the productivity of their investments over time. On that basis, Target's performance stands tall. For the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, our business generated an after tax return on invested capital of 15.1%, excluding discrete impacts from federal tax reform. This is performance many of our peers would love to report.",0.0949652,0.791

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and how that translates into our full-year performance. Our outlook is based on a bottoms-up view of fourth quarter sales and profit drivers, many of which are distinctly different than the rest of the year. Specifically, considerations in our outlook for the fourth quarter include the headwinds from six fewer holiday shopping days, the benefit from Target Circle, the rapid acceleration in fourth quarter digital penetration, a much higher sales mix of toys and electronics compared with the rest of the year, and the highly promotional nature of the competitive environment. Altogether, based on recent trends and our evaluation of all of these factors, we expect our business to generate fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%.",0.4343021,0.898
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,69,Remarks,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the operating margin line, our fourth quarter outlook anticipates a small rate increase, driven by a moderate improvement in our gross margin rate, partially offset by smaller increases in both our SG&A and D&A expense rates. This performance would translate into a mid to high-single-digit increase in operating margin dollars, and an expected range for adjusted EPS of $1.54 to $1.74. And today, based on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook, we raised our full year guidance range for adjusted EPS to $6.25 to $6.45. The midpoint of this new range is $0.30 higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance range. If we achieve performance at the midpoint of our expectations, that would translate into full-year comparable sales growth of about 4%, operating income dollar growth in the low-teens, and EPS growth in the mid to high-teens. All of these metrics are much stronger than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, driven by upside in sales, category mix and fulfillment mix within our digital channels.",0.3188702,0.917

This model is based on the ability under normal economic conditions for our business to generate low-single-digit growth in sales, mid-single-digit growth in operating income, and high-single-digit growth in EPS or better. Based on what we've seen so far this year, we are clearly on track to deliver performance meaningfully better than this baseline model in 2019, reflecting some of the unique dynamics we've seen so far.

Obviously, as a team, we enjoy reporting strong quarterly performance, and the last couple of quarters have been really gratifying. But, the goal of our strategy is to make Target a leading retailer and a world class company over the long term. It's about making Target more than just a good place to work, but an employer of choice, at our headquarters, in our stores and throughout our supply chain. It's about making every Target store a valuable part of their local community, and working with those communities to make them a great place to live and work. It's about making Target a special place for our guests when they shop in every channel. A retailer provides inspiration, while helping our guests save time and money, a company like no other focused on bringing the joy of everyday delights to all of our guests.

So, electronics and toys do go up substantially in the mix, how are you thinking about those categories into the holiday, but then on the other hand, obviously that e-commerce stack was very impressive and -- at least back here in the fourth quarter.

So, obviously, we're seeing more footsteps in our stores, more visits to our site. I think, that's going to translate into against the shopping more categories and greater relevance and a stronger relationship with that guest. So, we can try to parse how that guest is changing over time. But, I think the important thing is we just continue to see really strong traffic growth, guests shopping more categories. We've talked about the rapid expansion of small formats. We're moving into new neighborhoods. Those are guests that were not shopping Target on a regular basis before, they are now.

Brian, you talked about apparel for a little bit, but I wanted to dive more into it. Because greater than 10% growth in your apparel business probably means you grew in absolute dollars more than anybody in the entire United States apparel industry. So -- and even if that's not the case, it's an acceleration for 5% last quarter. So, can you dig more into what's driving that? Is that private label brands? Is that national brands, like what you saw at Levi's? And what exactly are you are doing in jewelry accessories that's driving that growth there?",,0.973

We did certainly see a oversized increase in market share during the quarter in apparel. I think our teams have done a fabulous job of curating our own brand assortment, really having the right assortment in front of the guests. We've delivered exceptional quality and value in those categories. I think, we've been on trend for the season. And I think our commitment to our new store operating model where we have dedicated business owners in that apparel category that are helping our guests each and every day is really driving great results. So, the combination of the work we've done with our owned brand assortment, adding some new national brands, like Levi's in select stores, the service that we're delivering in-store, and the inspiration we're creating online has really come together in the apparel category. So, I'm really proud of the work the team's done there.

And then, John, clearly you're excited about same-day options this holiday season. And I was just trying to think about given -- strategically, given that it's a shorter holiday season than in years past, is it more of a strategic competitive advantage to offer same-day options and do you think that that's actually going to accelerate adoption by customers? Thanks.",,0.959
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,93,Answer,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We do. I mean, I am excited about the great progress the team has made over the past year in our same-day offerings Order Pick Up, Drive Up, Shipt, all the investments we've made there to improve the efficiency of the team and their ability to ensure that we have a package ready for you in an hour or less, regardless of how you're going to interact with us. And I think, you're right, when people become time strapped, digital is an easy way and being able to knock it off your list very quickly that day, if you want to pick it up, great; if you just want to swing by, we'll put it in your car or we'll deliver it to your home.

And as you get near the end of the holiday season, the stores become such a huge advantage for us. We'll be well stocked. We'll have a great team there, like Brian pointed out, providing service. And if you -- again, if you want to order it online, we'll have it sitting there waiting for you, either to put in your car or come in and grab it.

I think, it starts on the gross margin line and kind of back to the key things from my remarks earlier, strength there, when apparel was running at 10% comp, that's really healthy on the margin line. Good gross margin rates in that category. And we sell more products at right price versus at discount at the end of the season, when our style categories do well. The second was the stronger than expected store sales. That's always healthy for margin. And then, finally, to maybe piggyback on some of what John just said, where our digital fulfillment growth came from. When those same-day options that the guest is responding to drive 80% of our digital growth, that's healthy from an operating margin rates perspective as well on year-over-year basis.",0.1297585,0.972

But, I think as you look at the third quarter, I start with the strength in traffic up 3.1%, the strength in our stores comping at almost 3%, the continued strength in digital in our two-year stack in the quarter rounds to 10%. So, we're putting good numbers on top of good numbers. We'll continue to do that over time. But, I think the balance in our portfolio where both our style and essential categories are performing, our stores are driving growth, our digital channels are continuing to accelerate, and the overall composition of the quarter to me with a very high quality quarter, were all factors of our business, were working together as one.",0.3008596,0.966

I think, there was a comment at the remodels in the second year performing better than expected. And I was just wondering, if you could give -- some of our survey data is actually showing the same thing.

TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,102,Answer,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're a few years into this now, and we have consistently seen the second year performance. We didn't expect that going into this, honestly, and we didn't model for it as we looked at the financials of the remodels. But, it's certainly a pleasant surprise. So, we believe it is sustainable because we continue to see it for the second year of the second year, I guess, you would say. So, we're pleased with that. I think what drives it is the guests come in, it takes a little while to figure out the store, we see them engage with the store immediately, because the environment is so much better, the presentation is better. You pair that, as Brian said earlier with the change in the operating model and better service in the store in many parts of the stores, great training for our team so that they can be of more assistance to the guests. And then, we see the guests continue to engage in different parts of the store and really experience everything we have to offer.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Scott, to give you a little additional insight, when we talk to guests who come into a newly remodeled store, and they might have been a previous Target shopper in that store, some of the feedback we get is, have we added new categories? Have we added new assortment? So, because of the changes we've made in the décor, the layout, the experience, they start to discover even more categories than they had shopped before. I think that's a big part of what we're seeing in year two. So, guests might have been coming to us for household essentials and toys, they're now shopping in apparel and home. They're discovering additional categories. And I think that's helping us pick up market share in those remodeled stores in multiple categories.",0.0601719,0.58

On the owned brand front, it really starts with providing products that we think the guests will respond to. And so, curated owned brand product that drives repeat purchase and loyalty over time. So, we start there. And when that owned brand product does well, it translates favorably to the gross margin line. And so, the strength we've seen and the growth of our owned brands over time has diffidently been a positive on the margin side.",0.5579206,0.961
TGT-2019-Q3-2019-11-20,110,Answer,2019-11-20,3,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Ed, we will -- the way I'd start is, we will pick pack and deliver either in store, through Pick Up and Drive Up or Shipt to guests more packages in the next five weeks than we did in the entire year of 2015. And so, the teams have done an outstanding job of going back, redoing processes, investing in technology, investing in training, reengineering our processes continually. And this year, we've seen productivity increases in pick prep and pack and ship of close to 60% in store. So, we believe we have a significant runway in front of us to continue that. The other thing I would compare this to is if you look at our average store does a little bit over $300 a square foot, our top quartile of stores approaches $800 a square foot. So, we have huge capacity just in those boxes to move far more inventory than we do today with far more team members doing it. Now, whether that goes out the front of the store or the back of the store, it's still just moving inventory through the store. And so, we believe we have a long runway to continue to fulfill.

So, they are experienced, talented, great leaders. I have enormous trust in their capabilities to lead us going forward.

We're eager to share our insights on the extraordinary year that just passed as well as our vision for what's next, but I couldn't start today without reflecting on the fact that a year ago at this time, the pandemic was just beginning to unfold, and in an effort to keep everyone safe and to limit travel, we decided to convert this meeting to a virtual format. While we miss hosting our in-person gatherings, it's prudent to stick with virtual presentations once again this year, but we're looking forward to resuming our live events, including this one and our annual shareholders' meeting in 2022.",1.1772411,0.852
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,5,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As I look back over the past year, a year when so much care and compassion was called for, I see purpose coupled with capabilities as the essential enabler of our response. The story of Target in 2020 is the story of a team that wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us, drawing on capabilities that were equal to that ambition after years of building and investment.",1.0519853,0.874
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,6,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I want to start today by publicly recognizing and thanking our team. I'm incredibly proud of the resilience, empathy, care, and concern they've shown for each other our guests and communities through a very challenging 12 months and counting. None of what we'll share today would have happened without them.",1.7981989,0.875
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,7,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Even before the dramatic challenges of last year took hold, our team had been busy building the retail platform of tomorrow, but 2020 accelerated everything and, as such, our guests are already benefiting from and loving that platform today. At the heart of the platform was a belief that consumers would continue to flock to our stores for multi-category, one-stop shopping, a friendly, well-trained, and knowledgeable team, and joyful experiences. As we designed our strategy and invested accordingly, we relentlessly asked ourselves what products and services those stores should offer, where they should be located, how their operations should be tailored to meet neighborhood needs, and ultimately how to make our stores work together with all of our other assets as one shopping platform that would keep guests turning to Target, however they want to shop.",1.4658207,0.962
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,8,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In answering those questions, we did two things at once. We placed the physical store more firmly at the center of our omnichannel platform and we created a durable, sustainable, and scalable business model that puts Target on a road of our own. Our goal was to use our proximity, nearly 1,900 stores within 10 miles of the vast majority of the U.S. consumers to offer the fastest and easiest digital fulfillment in retail, and the capabilities we've built to become America's easiest place to shop also cracked the essential question of how to grow our digital sales exponentially while maintaining the overall profitability of our business.",1.0155546,0.827
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,9,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When we began this journey, we didn't know we would be facing a global pandemic, mass quarantines, rapid unemployment, and the need to limit the number of people in public spaces, and yet when those threats emerged in 2020, we were ready, and without hesitation millions of American families turned to Target like never before. That happened because of decisions we made four and five years ago, and today Christina Hennington, our recently named Chief Growth Officer, along with John Mulligan and Michael Fiddelke will join me in mapping out how our team's efforts in recent years created a new baseline from which we'll continue to climb higher for our guests.",1.0090053,0.736
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,10,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Here's what I hope you'll take away from our story: first, that our team's ability to act and react in 2020 was years in the making. Without our multi-year road map to develop new capabilities and bring them to scale, 2020 could have exposed essential gaps in our business model. Instead, it proved beyond a doubt the durability of our model and it signaled our potential for continued growth in years ahead.",1.3614409,0.612
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,11,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second takeaway stems from a question I've heard frequently, especially in 2020: Brian, what's the secret to Target's growth trajectory? What you'll see in our presentation today is that the one thing that's driving our success is a focused commitment to several things: an integrated collection of strategies and capability that all work together and are very difficult to replicate, and ultimately make Target unique.",1.0904625,0.828

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When we gathered virtually for this meeting last year, I shared how our revenue had grown by $5.4 billion since 2017 and that we were consistently gaining share in many of our core merchandising categories; in other words, we were already starting to see steady growth from our investments. When we left that meeting, no one knew that COVID-19 would be declared a pandemic in the United States only a couple of weeks later. In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we only received one COVID-related question that day.",0.4830127,0.848
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,14,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But today as we look back on 2020, the business highlights are clear. Our revenue during the year increased another $15 billion. We gained meaningful market share across all five of our merchandising categories, totaling about $9 billion. Our full-year comparable sales were up more than 19% with a store comp of more than 7% in a year when people were staying home to stay safe, and a digital comp of 145%. Standing at this meeting three or four years ago, it would have been hard for any of us or any of you to imagine digital penetration of 18% without a dramatic deterioration in our P&L, yet today we announced record high full-year adjusted EPS of $9.42.",0.8538682,0.906

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Importantly, we accomplished all of this while making huge incremental investments in our team's safety and wellbeing and completely re-outfitting our stores to keep our team and guests safe. Far from being a fluke, this performance is further proof that we built a business model that is working as intended, one that puts Target in a category of its own.",0.0503479,0.904
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,16,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"A few consistent pillars have been and will continue to be at the heart of our playbook. The enormous investments we made in supply chain, store operations, and technology capabilities are already powering exponential growth in digital commerce. They've enabled us to use our stores as showrooms and service centers, but also as hubs for digital fulfillment. Without these investments, we simply wouldn't have been able to satisfy the exploding guest demand for same-day services, represented by more than 600% growth in drive-up. Likewise, Shipt is an extraordinary capability that grew by more than 300% last year and will continue to grow as more guests recognize the power of having their purchases brought to their doorstep in as little as an hour.",0.8624642,0.815

We're continuously improving our physical and digital shopping experience, investing billions in store remodels, specialized store roles, and service training for our teams while continuing to open up new small formats in urban centers, major college campuses, and iconic tourist destinations.",1.0176013,0.944

Even before 2020's outsized incremental expenditures on team health and safety, Target was an employer of choice, an academy company for those looking for rewarding and purposeful careers. In addition to accelerating our $15 starting wage in 2020, we celebrated our team's exceptional efforts with five separate recognition bonuses, most recently in January when we invested another $200 million to reward each of our frontline team member $500.",0.9005321,0.963

Ultimately the value they create in our core business has to contribute to a retail offering that's greater than the sum of the parts, but when we look at these elements individually, it's strikingly clear how much value we've added in a very short time.",1.1780598,0.932

We weren't even a top 10 ecommerce provider, and we were just getting our same day services off the ground. Today we have the most complete suite of same-day fulfillment services in the industry.

By the time we gathered for this meeting last year, Cat and Jack and five other own brands were generating $1 billion or more apiece in annual sales, and that tally has continued to grow. We cleared 2020 with 10 of our own brands each generating $1 billion or more and four of those crossed the $2 billion per year threshold.

Just this last Sunday, we launched the Levi's for Target collection, a limited time offering of home goods.

From this initial batch, we'll test, we'll learn, and we'll expand to hundreds of additional locations over time. This partnership combines Ulta Beauty's unparalleled assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty with our large, high growth, traffic driving beauty business and the ease and convenience of our fulfillment services.

Each was advanced based on how it would complement our other assets and capabilities, and we tested each one with an eye towards scale. In fact, the ability to integrate and scale is a key component of our decision making, and to emphasize the critical importance of scalability, I simply think back to what we could have done in 2016 but didn't.",0.5038887,0.412
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,27,,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"At that time, conventional wisdom held that the only way forward was for retailers to build capacity to send more packages to homes. Instead, we went our own way, built a fulfillment model with our guest's local store at the center and took the initiative on same day. We could just as easily have constructed additional fulfillment centers and driven the shift to digital sales with more ship-to-home capacity, but as you know, the economics were terrible and we wouldn't have been differentiated. In short, we didn't see the textbook solution as scalable or as likely to do what we've done, namely set the groundwork for years of guest satisfaction and brand loyalty as represented by comments like this: Thank you for providing curbside pick-up, it actually was the determining factor in me buying from Target instead of one of those online retailers; or this, or this, or this note from a guest who simply said, please always continue to do curbside pick-up, it is such a help even outside of COVID.

In the near term, we'll continue to generate incredible value by executing on our strategy. Throughout the pandemic, we built deep trust and loyalty with our guests who clearly prefer the ease and everyday inspiration of shopping at Target along with our relentless commitment to the safety and cleanliness of our shopping environment.

High stakeholder expectations for corporate responsibility only increased in the pandemic and the 2020 demonstrations for social justice, and as we've seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation.

Since then, I've held a number of roles across merchandising. Over that time, I've seen a lot in our business, ups and downs, good years and rebuilding years, economic booms and a Great Recession, but I've never seen anything like last year. Of course COVID-19 is an unprecedented event challenging our team and our guests in ways we never could have imagined, but how we responded at Target, empowering our teams moving quickly and leveraging the power of our multi-category assortment, that's Target at its best.

A lot of you probably saw this last spring in observing our business or in your own lives. In the space of just a few weeks at the outbreak of the pandemic, guests stocked up on food, beverages and essentials, then they turned to us for help in converting kitchen tables into classroom space and spare bedrooms into home offices, and then they looked to Target for fitness gear, games, and other entertainment as they settled in for the long haul.",0.8538682,0.765

We never looked at our business from the perspective of a particular category. Instead, we shaped our business decisions around what was happening in the world.

A great example if what we've done in the beauty space with 50 Black-owned and Black-founded brands now available in our industry-leading assortment, but we're committed to doing even more in key categories through our own brands and partnerships, building on our progress to ensure that we're delivering on our purpose of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life.",0.0523946,0.979

Beyond our pick-up options, the delivery capability we have in Shipt became even more important. It filled the need for guests who wanted an online order, especially for perishable items but also for so many other essentials across Target, brought right to their front doors.

As digital demand surged, we simultaneously broadened the assortment to make even more of the store available for same-day fulfillment. We added apparel to Shipt delivery offerings and tested adult beverage pick-up in a handful of markets. Most notably, we added fresh and frozen grocery to drive-up and order pick-up.

With drive-up and order pick-up, guests now display a PIN on their phones from a distance or through a car window so teams can securely deliver the right order while staying farther apart. We gave additional store team members backup training in fulfillment. For example, when we temporarily closed our Starbucks cafes, we taught hundreds of baristas how to efficiently pick and pack an order. That allowed us to keep those team members on the schedule and build their skills while also helping us manage high volumes during peak times, and we added thousands of drive-up parking spots so guests could get in and out even faster.

For example, they want to know if we can isolate how much of our growth is coming from drive-up, from digital in total, our own brand work, the remodel program, and any other way we can slice and dice the data.

These findings demonstrate that the benefits of drive-up and shipped go far beyond the value of an individual trip.

If you focus only on the amount of sales or growth by category, you can miss how they all work together to drive guest affinity. I see how this plays out with my own family. Over the next few months, the cold weather in Minnesota will finally end and my kids will need warm weather clothes. On the next Saturday morning Target run, we'll shop for those clothes and we'll also pick up some food, a few office supplies, laundry detergent, and maybe a prescription from CVS. We might wander over and purchase some spring décor, and we'll probably need some more ear buds since the kids seem to be inventing new ways to lose or destroy them.

It's our continued investments in the assets and capabilities, both tangible and intangible, that we can build and integrate to drive guest engagement and growth.

As John mentioned, in 2020 the penetration of digital sales advanced many years in a single year. With COVID as the catalyst, guests who had never tried our digital services quickly changed their habits and tried them sooner than they would have otherwise. We've long told you that on average, a multi-channel guest spends nearly four times as much as a store-only guest and nearly 10 times more than a digital-only guest. Now just in case there are any stats majors listening, that's a statement about correlation, not causation, so I'm not saying that a guest spending immediately changes that much after they move into a new channel.

Given its extreme volume, we suspected the store was running out of capacity, which was limiting its ability to grow, so when the site of a former Montgomery Ward's became available just across the highway in Daly City, we decided to buy it and build a new Target. This was unheard of in our history, building a new store less than a mile away from an existing one, and it was a calculated risk because the new store would only make sense if it drove incremental volume. That's exactly what happened. The combined sales of the two stores quickly grew far beyond what the single store was able to generate, and today each of those locations is in the top 5% of our stores based on sales volume.",0.0912812,0.026

Last year, our stores fulfilled more than 95% of our total sales, which works out to an average of about $47 million in fulfilled sales per store. That means our average store today is fulfilling about half of what the Colma store was already supporting 20 years ago. This offers another clear window into the growth potential of our average store today. But will there sometimes be extreme examples of stores that hit their capacity?

At the widest part of the funnel are macro factors, including uncertainty about the path of COVID-19 and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine campaign; how consumer attitudes and behaviors will evolve as we emerge from the pandemic, for example there's an emerging consensus that the nature of work will permanently change as employers move to a more flexible model and allow for more work from home.

A portion of this favorability was related to promotions, but the biggest single factor was a significant decline in clearance markdown rates as demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive categories far outpaced our expectations.

I've already talked about the unpredictability of sales and how category and channel mix alone can impact our margin, but even with that uncertainty, we should continue to benefit from the leverage we gained in 2020. All together, our expectation is that this year's operating margin rate will move down from the 7% we recorded in 2020 but remain above our 2019 operating margin rate of 6%, with the most likely outcome in the lower half of that range.",0.4031928,0.25

I know that it's difficult to model our business right now. Our team is facing the same challenge. In the face of this uncertainty, we continue to put a huge premium on flexibility and agility which served us extremely well throughout 2020. After all, flexibility is a cornerstone of our business model which features a uniquely diverse category mix and a store-based fulfillment model that can quickly adapt to changes in guest shopping patterns. With the benefit of this model, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, we're perfectly positioned to navigate any near term uncertainty while we continue to invest in long term growth.

As you'll recall, in the first quarter last year sales accelerated meaningfully after the onset of COVID, but our gross margin rate for the quarter declined an astounding amount, more than four percentage points in light of the cost to right-size our apparel inventory. Also in the first quarter, we began making meaningful investments in the health and safety of our team and guests, which we've maintained throughout the year.

Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. One note, if we attain that goal in 2021, it will mark our 50 th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend increases, putting us in a very small group of companies who can make that statement.

That might sound like a strange thing to say, but it's based on a number of factors that are clear today. First, with unexpectedly strong sales, our inventory turns shot up last year and we saw abnormally high payables leverage. While that had a positive near term impact on working capital, we also saw really choppy in-stocks which isn't how we want to operate under normal conditions. In 2021, we're planning for full shelves and better in-stocks, which will bring inventory turns and payables leverage back down to more sustainable levels.

As we accelerate investment in stores, supply chain modernization and replenishment capacity in support of those growth prospects, we'll likely see an increase in the invested capital portion of this metric over the next few years. Bottom line, while I believe this metric will stay very healthy and compare favorably to other retailers, I expect it will move back down into the 20% range over time.

Many were skeptical, which is why we said from the beginning that we were playing our own game in creating a category of one. Many thought the inevitable drift was for our store guests to become digital guests and that the current only ran in one direction. We saw something different.

We began to put all those pieces together like no one else had, and the experience was taking hold on the timetable we expected, then 2020 accelerated everything, and today Target is as synonymous with same-day and safety as it with style and swagger.

In the SG&A outlook, on our math you have about a billion dollars related to COVID costs such as special bonuses and cleaning, as well your raise to $15 an hour midyear. To what extent are you assuming these costs are tailwinds in '21, and can you quantify how significant the operating expense is related to investment that's pressuring SG&A dollars?",,-0.44

When you think about this within the year, we'll be annualizing the move to $15, and there will be some one-time things that don't repeat - just think about buying Plexiglas dividers, you only do that once. The final story in SG&A will be written by what our sales outcome looks like too, but we've got a lot of leverage within the model to continue to bend the cost curves in a direction we like throughout SG&A.

With SG&A, we expect that our SG&A rate will be lower than 2019's rate, and that's a benefit of the significant scale that we've gained since then. If you zoom out, I think there's going to be a lot of movement between the different levers within margin and SG&A, and so that's why we've tried to give some of our best thinking on the operating rate in total. It's a wide range - not every meeting I would herein be describing a one-point gap in operating margin between the incredibly strong 6 that we had in 2019 and the 7 we just put up. That whole range is in play. I think it's slightly more likely we're in the bottom half of that range when all the dust settles than the top half, but we're going to have a lot to learn throughout the year based on where we ultimately land.",1.0307,0.924

Trying to ask the SG&A question a little bit differently, if I look at what I think your COVID costs were and expenses were in 2020, it was north of a billion, and I think I calculate around $750 million in wages for the two quarters in the back half of 2020.

The biggest factor versus a couple of years ago on the SG&A line is going to be the benefit of scale, and we can put that to use in so many ways across the business. We've got a long history of investing in our team - that was a big part of the journey we embarked on in 2017, attracting and retaining the best team in retail has been a center of our strategy for the last several years and we continue to put the team at the forefront this year, and that will continue as well.",1.0016373,0.966

We took significant market share in the fourth quarter. If you recall our comments in earlier meetings, we talked about the fact that in the first three quarters of the year, we had picked up approximately $6 billion of market share, but we added another $3 billion of market share during the holiday season where all of our competitors were operating, so I think the vibrancy of our model, our ability to execute is something that I would ask all of you to focus in on, and I recognize you've got to do that in light of the fact that we haven't provided the precision that we normally do at this time.",1.2038477,0.958

With respect to the partnerships that you've announced, what is the gating factor on accelerating or not accelerating some of these partnerships at a faster rate? I mean, you've obviously given us the number of remodels that you've done and I'm sure they're not all primary targets for some of these partnerships, but it seems like you could move a little faster on those, so a little color on that would be great.",1.1289398,0.946
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,183,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Karen, I'll go back over time and think about the work we've been doing for the last five or six years. We always start by testing and learning, listening to the guests, listening to our team, iterating along the way, validating our assumptions both from a sales standpoint and a financial standpoint before we accelerate. This is the same approach we've taken with remodels over the years and new small formats. It's the same approach we took to pick-up and drive-up, and we're doing the same thing as we think about partnerships with great partners, like Apple and Ulta Beauty. We want to test and learn, make sure we get the model right, and then as we've demonstrated in the past, we'll hit the accelerator and make sure we expand and leverage scale as quickly as possible.",,0.361

On the gross margin, can you just add a bit more color on the '21 gross margin settling in a little bit below '19?

TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,189,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure Ed. The biggest factor in '21 was the supply chain and digital pressure, about 110 basis points of pressure on the year from that, but I think that's actually a good place to illustrate some of how we think about rate, because to me, it's all about the dollar impact, not the rate impact. Digital is a perfect example - if you would have told us we could double the digital business and only see 110 basis points of pressure last year, I think we all would have taken that outcome. But more important than that, when we're growing digital, we're deepening our relationship with guests, and great things happen in aggregate to us when that occurs, so sign me up for more digital growth going forward. We know that's a behavior that'll be sticky because what comes with that, in addition to a little bit of rate pressure on the margin line, is hugely accretive sales benefits in total.",0.2812116,0.93

We were incredibly pleased with Shipt's performance over the past year. They gained market share, very strong results for the business serving our retail partners, and just as important, and I'll come back to this, is Shipt has become an integral part of Target and our fulfillment and same day operations, so incredibly important there. But I think the team down in Birmingham did an outstanding job this year just scaling the business, right - they doubled the number of shoppers. We talked about how the Target sales on Shipt grew by 300%. Memberships grew by 130%. We continue to add great retail partners like Best Buy and Bed, Bath and Beyond and several and local and regional grocers, and so they've done just a really great job continuing to scale that business.",0.6684404,0.921

You heard us talk all morning today about the key lever, that having that suite of fulfillment, same-day fulfillment options for our Target guests has been over the past year, and really over the past several years, and will continue to be in the future. Not only is that the preferred way our guest continues to grow with us, but they're also economically advantaged, and so we continue to see huge opportunities for Shipt to continue to work directly with Target to continue to fulfill our guests' needs.",0.6225952,0.918

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other thing I would say is we see when a--very similar to drive-up, when a guest engages with Shipt through Target, again we see growth in our sales in-store and online on the Target platform as well, so they get more engaged with Target. That is hugely valuable for us. We bought that capability three years ago thinking this is what it would be - it would be incredibly important for us from a same day perspective.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'd just go back to a point that we've made a number of times - our most valuable guest is the guest that utilizes all of our assets, shops in our stores, leverages order pick-up, uses drive-up when it's convenient for them, and also more and more leverages the benefit of a personal shopper through Shipt, so we think that continues to be the easiest place to shop in America. Having all those assets available for our guests is critically important, and we think those are going to be very sticky over time.

I guess first, you were pretty early on in raising wages. Do you think that having a premium relative to some of your competitors is important to kind of keep the customer service level high? I guess I'm just asking that because it does seem like industry wages are moving up.

At that time, we said the most important investment we were making was in our team, and I think the results we've seen in 2017 and 2018 and 2019, and 2020 is a by-product of that commitment to our team, investing in wages and benefits, investing in training and crew opportunities, and I think it's allowed us to build the best team in retail, that's incredibly engaged, that's focused on taking care of our guests, but also taking care of each other.",0.2296357,0.982

They stepped up during the pandemic and made sure we created a safe shopping environment. As we scaled drive-up and saw growth rates of 500% or 600%, they flexed and were able to meet the needs of the guests, so I think the fact that we've taken a leadership position with wages, invested in our team, provided them the opportunities to grow their careers, that's a hallmark of the commitment we've made at Target to creating the best team in retail.

TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,209,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Scott, I think on fulfillment costs, we continue to make progress on our fulfillment costs through two paths. First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it, so order pick-up today, drive-up today, Shipt today, ship from store, all of those are cheaper than they were two years ago, so we continue to see our costs come down there.",0.8714695,0.949
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,210,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second way we see our costs come down is through mix. Drive-up, order pick-up, and Shipt all have much better economics, as we've said for years, than shipping from the back of our stores, which also has better economics than shipping from our fulfillment centers, and they are the fastest growing portion of our portfolio. In addition to that, ship from store grows much faster than fulfillment, so we see favorable mix as well. We continue to be really pleased with the progress we're making on the unit economics of shipping or delivering goods, fulfilling goods to our guests.",0.2910356,0.71
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,211,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The only thing I might add to that is, John talked about the power of having stores at the hub of that fulfillment equation, and that helps all those marginal economics. But also important not to forget is the thing that matter most economically with digital is the growth in guest spend in total as they become those omnichannel guests that have a deeper relationship with Target overall. Anytime we're looking at the slicing and dicing the P&L by channel, which we do a lot of and we've made a lot of progress getting more efficient over time, that always has to be stapled to the greater impact of that greater guest spend in total as they use more and more of our digital component services.",0.8878428,0.077
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,212,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Scott, one of the examples we've shared over the last year is the Target guest that is now using drive-up actually spends more money in store. It just deepens that relationship, so we can look at the economics fulfillment node by fulfillment node, but it's really how it all comes together and how we deepen relationship with our guests, get them to use all of our assets and utilize both stores and digital fulfillment channels over time. So as John said, we're going to continue to improve the economics of each one of those capabilities, but it's really the sum of the parts and that deeper relationship we build as our guests use more of our fulfillment nodes over time.",0.5513713,0.933
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,213,Question,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I appreciate that answer. As a follow-up to what you guys are saying, obviously Amazon has struggled with this too, right - their fulfillment costs grow faster than their sales, and I think looking at it just as one fulfillment cost, do you guys see a path ever for--because I know Amazon struggled here too, to getting fulfillment costs to grow on a slower basis than your sales, because that's obviously where the leverage would be able to come in if you can make that happen.",0.5992632,0.983
TGT-2020-Q4-2021-03-02,214,Answer,2021-03-02,4,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Scott, the place I'd start is the power that the store gives us to fulfill, because everything's cheaper when it comes through the store, and that helps us on the cost question that you asked. It's cheaper to ship a box a shorter distance from a local store after it's ridden our supply chain rails all the way to that store. Same-day fulfillment economics look a lot like store economics to us, and that's the piece, to John's point, that's growing fastest, and so the stores give us an incredible advantage to have advantaged cost profiles as we fulfill.",0.7212444,0.889

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other thing that the stores give us that has been incredibly valuable this year is great flexibility. We've seen the ability of our stores to scale to meet guest need in a way that I think probably would have surprised us, if we could go back a year in time and see it all coming. But the stores are so flexible, there's real power in being able to say, it's that same piece of inventory sitting on a shelf and we can put it in a box and ship it out the back, we can drop it in a guest trunk via drive-up, they can place it in their cars on a store trip, and not having to be able to see perfectly exactly how that demand is going to come but knowing the inventory can fulfill it and our great store team can make it happen, however the guest chooses to shop, gives us a huge flexibility advantage as well.",1.0781826,-0.681

My first question, I want to ask, I guess a longer term question on margins. It's sort of outside of '21, so I know '21, there's not a lot of visibility, but I know the conversations we've had about margins is more about they're an outcome and you're not managing to a particular margin.

When I think about margins in the long run, the straw that will stir that drink is sales growth, and we're incredibly confident in the way we're positioned to build on the deepening guest trust that we gained this year with long-term sales growth. You can see the power of leverage in our model in an exaggerated way in 2020, no doubt, but that's the focus of where we're investing going forward, is to continue to gain share and grow the top line, because that gives us a lot of levers to pull below there on the margin line.",0.9267294,0.862

When the guest chose not to really change their wardrobe very much and wore yoga pants all year, it had an impact on the apparel industry, yet we significantly outpaced the performance in that industry. This year, people are going to buy new clothes because people don't want to wear the same thing over and over. They'll do their make-up, they might even buy a piece of luggage if they're venturing out on a trip, and that ability to flex with the needs of the guest through the breadth of our portfolio is what's going to keep us growing share and gaining against the industry for years to come.",,0.361

Again, I think so much of it has been the investments we've made in safety, in the shopping experience throughout the last year. We certainly have seen guests shop all of our categories in the month of February, so broad based strength, and I think again the guest is responding to some of the newness in our assortment. To Christina's point, they're looking for the opportunity to shop our stores and find new items. They're tired of the yoga pants and really appreciate some of the new assortment we have in apparel. They're still shopping for their homes as they refresh décor. They're still eating at home, so kitchen and food-related items are still really important. We see a guest shopping all of our categories, taking advantage of both stores and our digital channels, and I think it's a by-product of the investments we've made throughout the pandemic to build trust, to make sure they know we've got a safe shopping environment, and the great work that our teams have done to make sure that they're focused every day on meeting the needs of our guests.",1.2034384,0.504

We continue to build in support of sales, and the reality is that we are--we're looking to fill in the gaps where we have a few, selectively, but it's been a marked improvement throughout the year and the responsiveness of our team is incredible.

We've shared some of the digital guests that we've gained in past calls. The thing that we're most focused on is deepening the relationship of those guests, that it really stepped up their trust and their spend and their share of wallet with Target over the last year. We talked about the 12 million new omnichannel guests this year - that's the place where we focused a lot of that kind of deepening of the guest relationship and the things that we're tracking. We're encouraged to see the stickiness of a lot of the new behaviors that were tried in 2020, so things like drive-up. Thanks to the incredible experience our store teams provide, once guests try a service like that, they come back, and we've seen higher rates of stickiness this year than historically for some of those digital fulfillment services.

They may be coming to us for electronics and toys. To Michael's point, while most of America shops with Target, during the pandemic we've seen consumers consolidate the number of places where they shop, they're now experiencing and are active in more categories, and we think that provides lasting benefits for us for years to come.",1.014736,0.361

I'll come back to something we haven't talked about a lot today, which is the membership within Target Circle, the fact that we now have 90 million members in Target Circle, which gives us an understanding of their needs, their wants, how they're shopping, new categories and new items we can introduce them to, so we're going to continue to make sure we leverage Target Circle to build deeper relationships, introduce that guest to new categories, new fulfillment options, and over time we think that's a very valuable asset that will continue to drive growth, help us build market share, and continue the momentum that we established in 2020.",0.5509619,0.751

Shipping from a store is the best way to lower the total cost of digital fulfillment.

Last year we remodeled 28 stores across the metro and guests noticed. The refresh design is inviting guests come back in and to shop, and the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. We saw with Dallas and with LA 25 a few years ago that we can learn a lot from putting our latest thinking into one market.

On the topline, we are planning for a low single-digit increase in our first quarter comparable sales.

As you began seeing in our results last year, our new stores are starting to have a meaningful impact on our total sales growth.

While we are not going to provide long-term guidance today, we can offer a strategic view. With the changes we're making to our business model, we expect our financial model to evolve as well.

And then the second pressure point is the shift to lower margin channel and can ask you to comment on each, where you are in terms of your spend, the SG&A guide sort of implies that we've reached some peak level and we are going to taper off and then second with regard to the mix shift online, where are you in that journey. You said the customer is agnostic, are you financially agnostic?",,-0.666

We have made significant investments in last year, in our team, in new capabilities and new brands. You are going to see that stabilize as we go into 2018 and as Cathy mentioned in our outlook, we expect to see gross margin rates stabilize, if not slightly improve in 2018, offset by some of the investments we will make in SG&A.",0.3164142,-0.316
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,152,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I think we have reached the point of general stability in our model. We are going to continue to invest. It's a period of now acceleration. But we have spent a lot of time over the last three years, testing and validating our investments, making sure the right thing for our guests, the right thing for our shareholders, they are going to be sustainable and they are also going to provide the right return on invested capital and I think you saw that today in our outlook.",0.9234548,0.625

Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The only thing I would add, I mean is, kind of longer-term that perspective of as our business model is evolving, I am using the stores at the center of that strategy, we do expect that you'll see continued really terrific ROIC or after-tax ROIC. And so kind of probably lower operating margins that we've seen historically not inconsistent with where we are today, but really strong continued asset efficiency, which will drive the ROIC, so growth in ROIC.",1.3557047,0.958

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,156,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But one of the great highlights from our fourth quarter was the fact that we saw really strong traffic and growth both in our stores and our digital channel, and we expect as we go into 2018 to continue to drive positive growth into our stores to drive positive comps in stores that's critically important and to continue to be a leader in digital growth.

Why wouldn't you expect operating margins to lift in 2020 given the run-off in D&A and the spent is actually over? And then I have a question about, John, if you talk a little bit about the execution -- a lot of I heard -- what we have seen so far today is absence some of the improved processes, but it didn't really address maybe the headwind in the store, it's the modular issue that the systems will get the right quantities, but the challenge is the modular are not really set in a way that allows that the flow very as nice as you would like see. So how do you address that the modular side is the store format begins to change over time?",,0.895
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,158,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"John, let me start with the first part of the question. And Wayne you are absolutely right. As we get into the out years, we are going to see our remodel schedule begin to normalized, right now we are in a catch-up state and as we accelerate over the next three years, obviously, we will touch the vast majority of our stores. So in the out years we do expect that to normalize. But we have a lot of work to do in these next few years.

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,165,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I think this goes back to why we talk about flexibility in the supply chain to address that. I think when you look we are at today and you are right, it will evolve over the next 10 years, I -- who knows what will have in store then, maybe Mark does, but that will come later, 70% of that stuff doesn't sell more than one per store per week, so I don't need to flow case packs into that store for those items, you think about bike helmets, the likelihood of us selling more than one bike helmet in a week, this time a year in Minneapolis is very low.",1.1076545,-0.2

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We may sell one and probabilistically we will sell one sometime this month, but we won't sell more than that and so that's why we go back to flexibility. There's things that are going to have to go in there in a very high speed, high-capacity, to your point we need to make sure a case pack fits on the floor or case pack in half or three case packs in the case of Tide or eight case packs or 20 case packs, because we will move that in pallet loads.",0.9017601,0.723
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,167,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C.

We have a large team working on supply chain analytics, primarily located, but not exclusively located out in the Bay area, working with Mike's team to provide the technology and the analytics in combination, and again if you look at Perth Amboy, Mike's team built an entirely new warehouse management system and then there is the analytics attached to it to move how much inventory.

I think you will see -- next year this meeting you will see that our penetration of units delivered from stores will grow relative to 2017 and relative to two-day, absolutely, we would expect the majority of that to be delivered from store.

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,205,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,John R. Hulbert,Vice President-Investor Relations,"Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We've got a variety of questions about Shipt, so I'll just give you all of them. One being are we getting new guests coming in because of Shipt yet. One the decision are to maintain the marketplace in other words share the marketplace with other retailers on the Shipt platform. And then, finally, the decision of why to require them versus to just become a partner on their platform?",0.5492767,0.743

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,207,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I think, maybe I'll start with just, what are we trying to do with Shipt and then hopefully address some of those questions. We have three priorities for Shipt that we have been focused on since we close the acquisition. One is, scale Target nationally on the Shipt app and Shipt.com and we are well down that path. We are in 455 stores. We are adding markets every single week.",0.493246,0.827
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,208,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C.

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,209,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then third was expand the marketplace and I guess to get out a little bit of this. We think the value here is about bringing all those retailers together. That's the value of the membership. We know consumers have different reasons they go to different retailers, often they come to Target. We really like that. Sometimes they go other places. But bringing all of those retailers together on one marketplace is incredibly powerful to bring consumers into the Shipt app and so we had great conversations with other retailers. We already have great partners and HEB and Publix and Meyer, Cosco, all on the app and we will continue to grow that. So we are very interested in continuing to grow the marketplace.",0.2316824,0.974
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,210,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And to the other question, Cathy, John and I all spent quite a bit of time looking at other same-day delivery options and we invested a lot of time getting to know the Shipt organization. We were attracted to Shipt and decided to take an ownership position because of that personal connection we saw with their member.",0.0970119,0.422
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,211,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And as we spent time and went to Birmingham, work with some of their shoppers, saw the caliber of people that were shopping for Shipt, these moms were shopping for moms, the approach they took to really building a relationship, we felt it was so important to own that last mile touch and that human interaction that we think really differentiates Target from anyone else in that space. So we certainly had options to partner with other last mile delivery companies.",0.751535,0.618
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,212,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But we thought Shipt had a very different approach. It wasn't just the transaction. It was building a relationship and we thought owning that human touch was very consistent with what we think is our greatest asset and that's our people that make such a difference as we talked to guests and they describe why they shop at Target, as I said early today, most of the answer is pretty simple, is because of our team. Okay.",0.8272616,0.896

Two questions, first, the cost to upgrade these fulfillment centers modernization, John, you talked about, can you give a sense of maybe how much that is going to contribute to the capital spend over the next few years, what's the cadence, how many do you need to do and when do we get to the end point there?",,0.44
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,214,Question,2018-03-06,4,2017,Peter Benedict,Robert W. Baird,"And the second point question would be on inventory growth. How should we think about that as you kind of clean up the backrooms, you put the fall product over the supply chain, how should we think about into our growth maybe versus sales something?",,0.766

So that's kind of the sequence we are thinking about year-over-year. This won't happen over the next 18 months, because it can't. This is a conversation we have internally a lot.",0.7396643,0.226

A longer term as we talked many times, Peter. We do see that inventory loads as we move product exactly where we need it, when we need it, we will continue to come down. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a great guest experience and we are in stock and so we are going to balance that as we are evolving the supply chain so through this transition and then obviously to support all of the wonderful new brands and products we are bringing in.",0.5666347,0.92

But this is one that's going to take time. To John's point we are not shutting down our system for nine months. It's going to be a multiyear journey, but we are going to make sure that we do it right and we get the right returns and continue to provide the right experience for our guests.

TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,228,Question,2018-03-06,4,2017,Gregory Melich,MoffettNathanson,"So I had a follow up for Cathy and Brian another question. Cathy the $3.5 billion CapEx, that is I think about $500 million and what we are thinking before. Should we think about that, I know you are not giving long-term guidance, but does that more of a pull-forward of things that you had or more given what you see just this more stuff you want to lean into this year? And then, Brian, I had a follow-up?",0.8717482,0.175
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,229,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah. So consistent with our strategy, Brian, had laid out, we intend to remodel, we are seeing a great returns, 2% to 4% lift. We make sure we have great returns on invested capital with those and as we've seen the remodels perform we are going to continue to get towards that 1000 stores that Brian talked about, but and by the time we get there is much of our fleet will be much younger in age, obviously, some of the heavier needs are earlier on, which is why the capital is little higher. But I would expect we've done the $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion this year, obviously, we're not slowing down, we are seeing great returning and we are seeing a great response from our guests. So we are not giving long-term guidance, but you can expect that we will continue down those stores.",1.196069,0.952
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,230,Question,2018-03-06,4,2017,Gregory Melich,MoffettNathanson,"Okay. And then, Brian, you talk a lot about acceleration, right. What happened last year it's now time to really accelerate it? Could you talk a little bit more about the brand acceleration? I mean, it seems like with 12 brands and 12 months and is that a new run rate, I mean, can the organization really be expected to come up with that many new great brands and ideas every year or is there certain amount that you -- or could have become 18 in a year or is there certain amount of product that you sort of limited on that ultimately where we only want to change over a quarter of the SKUs or something like that?",0.1495838,0.916
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,231,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Greg, I wouldn't expect that to be the long-term run rate. But certainly as the Mark and his team had look at the portfolio, we've seen opportunities through replacing the existing brands that's been our portfolio, fill new white spaces and over the balance of 2018 we will continue to bring newness and innovation own brands and then we will continue to listen to the guests, understand category trends and bring great newness and innovation, whether it's with a new own brand or some of the great partnerships we will continue to bring forward on a limited time basis like we announced earlier today.",0.0618093,0.958
TGT-2017-Q4-2018-03-06,232,Answer,2018-03-06,4,2017,Brian C.

I have a regarding the renovations and remodels, how do you prioritize the renovations and remodels, are you working with the stores of the greatest opportunity, the older stores or how do you work on that?

So it's a little bit of everything you said actually when we are choosing the stores, we have model that helps us generate age, condition, when is the last time, part of that comes into it is how hard is this store shop, how high volume is it, what is the average basket, so do they get shopped really hard day in and day out.",0.5415473,0.459

Our goal is always to put in as many elements as we can in any individual store. The calibration though is we want to make sure that store can afford to have that much investment. And so lower volume stores get less and the great thing is and I've seen this happen multiple times when we say, hey, here is we are going to draw the line on lower volume, Brian, challenges the team, go figure out a way to get these two more elements into that store. They go back. They value engineered. They find ways to do it more efficiently.

Moving down the P&L, our third quarter gross margin rate of 28% was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago.

Michael, you began the question already by suggesting you're not sure how long the gross margin's going to last. Can you at least help us understand if the third quarter was the peak gross margin degradation that you expect to realize over the next few quarters? And what are you doing to mitigate this gross margin pressure in terms of passing along price increases to the consumer? Thank you.",0.1756038,0.89
TGT-2021-Q3-2021-11-17,119,Answer,2021-11-17,3,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks for the question, Michael. As you know, we don't guide margins specifically out into future quarters, but I will say and reiterate what I said in my remarks. I think you're seeing in the third quarter the result of some very specific investments we made. And the biggest of those investments is an investment to make sure we've got a great inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.",0.274253,0.807
TGT-2021-Q3-2021-11-17,120,Answer,2021-11-17,3,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And pulling all the levers within the system to ensure we're there for the guests has been our priority and some of those levers, think of expediting products come at a cost and you saw some of that in the third quarter.

My first question is, you raised the outlook for the fourth quarter, and can you talk about what you're seeing from the consumer so far this holiday season?

I probably have many on the gross margin and the gross margin outlook. Seasonally usually gross margin does sort of go down to 300 basis points just relative to the third quarter rate. However, you talked about a lot of -- I think there's like two components here to think about.",,0.0

TGT-2021-Q3-2021-11-17,134,Question,2021-11-17,3,2021,Christopher Horvers,JPMorgan Chase,"So, I guess as you roll those 2 pieces together and ignoring mix for a second, how are you thinking about those two relative costs as the freight component?

TGT-2021-Q3-2021-11-17,135,Answer,2021-11-17,3,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Chris, you're thinking about it conceptually, I'd say, in the right way in that third quarter and fourth quarter kind of straddle the big inventory builds in relief that happens for us in advance of the holiday season every year. And so those will be the factors at play. While I won't begin to get into the specifics at that level of gross margin for what that means in Q4 but I'd just zoom out and say I feel really good about our ability to manage all of the levers and to see EPS growth of almost 9% in the third quarter. And yes, some investment in gross margin, but also a ton of leverage on the SG&A line. And we feel really good about how that positions us for the fourth quarter and the investments in inventory.

So, when you look at your top-line growth in 3Q relative to your EBIT growth. And then so we look at the gap on those 2 in 3Q and then back into 4Q. It looks like you will have much stronger, much wider, or sorry, a much narrower gap on top-line relative to EBIT growth in 4Q. So, is that a function of the fact that a lot of these supply chain costs and inventory costs were pulled into 3Q? And then I guess what I want to ask bigger picture is looking at '22, how should we think about that algorithm generally top-line growth relative to EBIT growth?",0.033156,0.954

Its guess I'd start by saying it's wrapped into the guidance we're giving for the balance of the year. We would expect Op income rate of 8% or higher, and that's inclusive of a lot of moving pieces and puts and takes throughout the P&L. But I'll tell you the place that starts is growth, and that's why high single-digit to low double-digit expectations for the fourth quarter kind of where the short-term algorithm starts. And with that kind of growth, we feel confident in our ability to put together a P&L that works. The time will be right in the future to unpack the future year algorithm, but I will say, over time, we expect to be a growth Company. We expect to be a Company that's growing the topline and gaining share over time, and that's where that algorithm will start.",0.2529677,0.586

TGT-2021-Q3-2021-11-17,142,Answer,2021-11-17,3,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I describe us as still chasing. The strength in the top-line means that we're still not seeing those clearance markdowns returning for us like you've heard me talked about quarter-over-quarter.

As you'll recall in our conference call 90 days ago, we described how our business was positioned to deliver single-digit comp growth, in the back half of the year, on top of very strong growth of more than 20% in the back half of 2020.

Target's performance through the first half of the year has consistently exceeded our expectations. This performance combined with the continued strength in the U.S. consumer, gives us increasing confidence that this fall, our business can generate comparable sales growth in the high single-digit range, near the high end of our previous guidance range. We have a similar outlook regarding profitability. 90 days ago, we said we expected our full-year operating margin rate would be well above the 2020 rate of 7%, with a potential for it to reach 8% or somewhat higher.",1.4130168,0.875

Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on Michael's last point, which is the way we've been able to synchronize every aspect of our strategy.

Families, discovery, joy, and the word all, which represent our strong commitment to inclusion across every aspect of our business. So I'd ask if everyone at Target already had a strong sense of purpose, why go to the trouble of putting it into words?",0.4940647,0.95
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,101,Remarks,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The answer is the alignment that it creates. Alignment of our strategy and alignment of our team. In the same way, we had a focus on what really matters most in the articulation of our purpose or relying on that purpose to focus both our strategic work and our everyday activities.

Christina and Michael, John, and I were out in stores yesterday and we were seeing guests shopping our entire back-to-school assortment. I think we've got a great assortment at a tremendous value.

Can you talk about how you're thinking about the gross margin in the back half overall, and within that, what are the puts and takes? Does that -- do the product in freight headwinds persist or perhaps elevate and to what degree are you assuming higher clearance and promotion levels to derive the 8% or more operating margin outlook.",,0.934
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,107,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Chris, you've heard us talk over time about all the levers we have within the business to offset some of those puts and takes, and I think the second quarter is a really good example of that. If you take out the sales return adjustment in last year's actuals, margins were essentially flat year-over-year and so we found some good offsets there and feel good about our profit performance. I think that same theme comes through loud and clear.",0.5468686,0.68
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,108,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We zoom out a little bit and look at a longer period. If you go back to the first half of this year versus the first half of 2019, 2019 gross margin rate was 30.1% for the Q1 and Q2 season. We're sitting at 30.4% right now in Q2 and 30.2% for the spring.

If you can maybe talk about the cost pressures that you're seeing in the food, grocery category versus general merchandise. Any quantification that you might be able to provide. And I also want to go back to private label performance, you mentioned, it grew faster in 2Q.

TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,115,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And that is exactly what we saw in the second quarter, that's the pattern we've been on. And as long as we continue to find unique opportunities to meet the guests' needs, that's going to persist. And so, you also know that owned brands represent a big portion of our sales mix, but even a bigger portion of our gross margin. So that creates a tailwind for us on the profit side. And then going back to your first question on costs.",0.6631191,0.878

So I wanted to just ask, you look at your sales productivity, you're up more than 40% on a sales per square foot basis since 2017. So I guess what I'm wondering is, with this higher productivity, how should we think about kind of the long-term margin structure? Or maybe, set a little differently, would you look to lean into investments going forward, or could we expect a little more sustainability in terms of the higher operating margin structure?",0.3037249,0.985

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"If I step back from your question a little bit, Karen, at the end of the day, growth powers so much of our margin equation and that's why we're so focused on investments that drive growth, and you can certainly see that in the improved productivity. That comes to bear in the math we do on new stores, that comes to bear for how we adjust our store footprint in a remodel. And so you'll see us consistently focused on investments that drive growth. With that growth comes good productivity on a per-square-foot basis, and we can translate that growth to good bottom-line profit.",1.51535,0.55

And then just, you also commented on the 70 basis points of gross margin pressure from higher product and freight costs. On the product front, can you maybe just give a little color on what you're seeing on the cost inflation versus retail inflation.

I guess the first one I have is you're holding a lot of cash on your balance sheet. You guys talked about the new share repurchase. But what is the ideal level of cash for you guys to hold?

TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,129,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Well, the answer to that question: priority one has been and always will be to invest in the business, and continuing to invest to drive growth is the first use of that cash. Our second capital priority is to support the dividend. We announced just last month, north of a 30% increase in our per-share dividend. And we have the good fortune with business, that continues to generate a lot of cash as we grow.",0.4719607,0.919
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,130,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, that gives us a capacity for share repurchase as well. Over time, you'll see us carry less cash than that 7.4 billion we have today to be sure. Optimal in normal times, it's something closer to flat to a little north of that cash on the balance sheet, depending on the period of the year we're in.

We're going to continue to invest in re-modeling our stores. And despite the progress, we've made, and we've remodeled just about half our stores to date, so you'll continue to see us invest in remodels.

Target continues to see outside gains in traffic. Over the last 90 days, has there been any change like the pattern of traffic, more weekday traffic versus weekend, especially as consumers go out and travel and do other activities?

Traffic has been very consistent and it's been consistently strong. And we're very excited about the early momentum in back-to-school and back-to-college as well.

TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,151,Question,2021-08-18,2,2021,John J. Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then I guess the broader question between the really strong growth you've had in Target Circle and your digital businesses, you have a lot more data on your consumer today. I guess how are you acting on that on a real-time basis and kind of what have you learned? Thanks.",0.355455,0.959
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,152,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, Ed. This is John. It's good to talk to you. On the ship-to-home, I think you hit right on it. Two things are going on. Just tremendous growth last year in ship-to-home at the -- particularly early in the second quarter of last year. So very, very strong growth and we're just camping over that. I think the second thing, and probably more importantly, is the continued growth in our same-day services, tremendous growth in Shipt, in Order Pickup, and Drive Up.",0.5448219,0.967
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,153,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the growth in Drive-Up is truly remarkable, but the one I like to look at is Order Pickup. We started that 6 years ago and it continues to grow meaningfully quarter after quarter, year after year after year. So all three of those are acting incrementally each year and not taking business away from each other. And as you know, the thing we love about that it's great service for our guests. They're our highest-rated services.",0.1780598,0.888
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,154,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Drive-Up is the single highest-rated service we have. But also for us, it's fast and very, very efficient. And we love the margin that comes along with those products. So as we've grown our digital businesses over the last several years, in particular over the last 18 months, the same-day services have grown significantly faster, and that's a good margin for our digital business.",0.4117888,0.949
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,155,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And that I can jump in on the Target Circle component. As you accurately reflected in your question, it's been a great program for us and we're up to over 100 million members in Target Circle, 100 million; it's quite substantial. And what primarily this is about is making sure that we are more relevant to our consumers in giving them great deals, more personalized offers, and relevancy that they'd appreciate.",0.8690135,0.821
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,156,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, as an example, in the second quarter, guests benefited from $70 million of savings from the 1% earnings on purchases, plus another $600 million worth of savings from the promotional offers.

You'll see us balance our messaging in the holidays around obvious affordability, great value. We'll certainly emphasize our same-day services, and we know how important they'll be for the guests during that holiday season and the strength of our multi-category assortment.

Could you just give us some context around is it a step-up in marketing, is what we're seeing in terms of the year-over-year offset versus prior year, is there something else happening in operating expenses if gross margins are going to be flat, but operating margins are going to be down a bit to the prior year?",0.8546869,0.128

It's all wrapped into our expectation for that OpEx line of the year. And similar to the second quarter, I expect you'll see some puts and takes. I mean, one of the things we're excited about in Q2 was to get back to a more normalized level of marketing spend.",1.7421203,0.817
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,165,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C.

I was hoping you could comment on how much more items you have to go to add to Drive Up. So I think you guys said 5,000 items were added in 2Q. How much more is there to go on Drive Up that can keep driving that super growth of that business? And then related to that, grocery, you added a lot of fresh items on Drive Up.",0.5636807,0.722

I think there are two things there that are driving growth. First is category expansion like you said, and we continue to work our way through the categories there. There's work for us to do. We'd like to add things like clearance to Drive Up and we'd like to add returns to Drive Up. And so I think there's a lot further we can go there from our category of product perspective.",1.6279165,0.902
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,171,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other side is just improving the service itself. And you'll see us continue to do that. We added more park -- Drive-Up locations, we're adding canopies to help with the weather, we added numbered parking lots so that we can find your black SUV among the 12 black SUVs that sit out in our parking lot waiting for Drive Up at any given time, and we added substitutions, and we added the ability to add another driver to come to do your -- pick-up order for you. So I think you'll see us continue to innovate the service as well.",,0.44
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,172,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we see a long runway for us to continue to improve the driveway.

The food and beverage business has been a real source of strength for us and continues to do exceptionally well, including the brands that we've launched. Good & Gather and Favorite Day are growing because they're just so relevant.

TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,174,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And your question about is the assortment expanding or is it the expansion onto Drive-Up: the assortment's always going to be a curated point of view, but when the guest stars in the digital experience rather than in the physical experience, there is much more understanding of who we are and they quickly are converting because of that convenience in Drive Up to Target food and beverage. And I think you'll see a lot of upside in the future from the success that we've built over the last several years in this business.",,0.0

TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,178,Question,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I realized Target's typical cadence is for lower EBIT margins in the second half, but this seems -- the magnitude of this deceleration seems to be about twice as much as the historical pattern. So just trying to get a sense of conservatism or costs in the back half. You called out the marketing expense or just what you're planning for the promotional activity in the back half, maybe? Any color you could help with that.",,0.886
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,179,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You're right, Kelly. There is some seasonality to help profit flows through our P&L quarter-by-quarter, spring versus fall. We feel really good about the back half of the year and the growth we expect to deliver and we think that yields 8% or north of their operating margins for the year.",,0.84
TGT-2021-Q2-2021-08-18,180,Answer,2021-08-18,2,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so while getting too precise on any specific line I think would be an exercise.

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,151,Question,2019-05-22,1,2019,Robert Ohmes,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning and great quarter. I'm actually going to ask two questions. One was just a follow-up, you know, Brian on your answer there, I get this question all the time, as you keep shifting digital fulfillment to the stores, how are you - how is the store SG&A not exploding or offsetting, you know, just maybe a little more color on how you are getting those dramatic savings, the 40% and 90% reductions?",0.4152956,0.791
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,152,Question,2019-05-22,1,2019,Robert Ohmes,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"And then I'll just tell you, the second question is on the second quarter, I'm just curious how you are - let me say it this way, some of your competitors are not doing as well as you might have done and they might have a lot of excess inventory in things like apparel. And I'm just curious what you think the environment is going to look like with a lot of your - some of your large competitors not in great positions right now?",0.8964046,0.541
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,153,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So why don't I let John start by talking about some of the process improvements we've made in-store and the way we're leveraging technology and systems to drive even greater efficiency as we fulfill those orders and then I'll come back and talk about the competitive environment.,0.2738436,0.872
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,154,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Robby. I think the first thing I'd say is, we are investing payroll in the stores to take care of the fulfillment that is going on. The one thing we don't want to do and we have been clear about this is pull payroll off the sales floor to take care of what's going on in the backroom. So we have put additional payroll in the backroom. And, of course, that payroll gets re-classed to gross margins because it is part of our fulfillment expense.",0.6111339,0.813
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,155,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But to Brian's point, I think the other thing, the stores team has done an outstanding job of discontinuing to refine their processes and introduce new tools that allow our teams to get more efficient, particularly in backroom operations, logistics of the store. So we're able to pull hours out of there either let them fall to the bottom line or more importantly we have reinvested a significant amount of those hours back into the sales floor to create a better service environment.",0.0278346,0.947
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,156,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we'll continue to work on that. The stores have great plan. They continue to do that, as we do more upstream and supply chain, we will continue to pull those back office, backroom, logistics kinds of hours out to the store, either centralize them upstream and make them more efficient or process optimize them, bring better tools from our technology partners to the stores, so that they get better and better. And that's a loop we've been on for quite some time. So the store'[s teams, the technology teams have done an outstanding job of continuing to manage our overall store expense.",0.3450675,0.972
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,157,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Robby, if we turn to the overall retail environment, we're seeing a very consistent and healthy environment across the US. I think what we're seeing right now is the bifurcation of winners and losers. And I think our performance now speaks for itself.",2.2120344,0.395
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,158,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,We're on eighth consecutive quarters of growing comps.

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,159,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So we feel really good about the progress Mark and his team made from a merchandising standpoint.

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,160,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I think what you are just seeing is you're seeing the emergence of winners who have been investing in their business, that are adapting to this new omni-channel environment. And unfortunately those that are ceding share that have not been able to invest and evolved to the new consumer environment.",0.5333606,0.44

I wanted to ask as you guys start to lap the Toy business, Toys 'R' Us in last year, the other - I know it has the comp impact, but it also - if I recall correctly had a gross margin impact negatively when it happened just because Toys are lower margin. How should we think about that sort of benefit so to speak as you start to cycle that this year, as it relates to the gross margin?",,-0.718

Look I mean, it does provide a high level of stability going to second and more in third and fourth quarter. I mean, we've been buoyant across the board because of that healthy mix and the strength of our own brand margins, so that's helping contribute to the overall mix. This will be a further stabilization point.",0.3576389,0.888
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,167,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Mark J.

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,176,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Michael, I'll start with the topic of tariffs, and as I said in our prepared remarks, obviously, we have been monitoring this very carefully. It has been a fluid situation for quite some time now. You know, our point of view hasn't changed. And as we think about tariffs we reflect on the impact it could have and will have on American families that are going to be paying higher prices.",0.3168236,0.401
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,177,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But I think our teams have done a very good job of trying to mitigate the impact in the short term. And as I think about where we sit going forward. One, I'll start with our multi-category portfolio is a huge advantage in this environment. And our ability to flex our focus from category to category is something that's somewhat unique to Target versus single category retailers.",1.0499386,0.831

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,180,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we're watching this very closely.

Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"Yeah, Michael I'll just share with you, John and I and others were in Asia last week meeting with our global vendors not just China or Asia based vendors and clearly tariffs was a point of discussion. Our current actions are not reactive, they are responsive and we've been planning these for some time, looking at the level of potential change and working with our deep vendor base we have trusted partnership and leveraging our current strength of performance to build opportunities to diversify, to work through price changes, and again as Brian said a very sophisticated and elevated team who have been anticipating change. And I think when you look at our Q1 results where we're able to effectively mitigate those risks from prior announcements, I think it bodes well for how we look to manage these moving forward.",1.3328373,0.973

Maybe I'll just answer to be clear that the anticipated 25% increase that will go in place in June is contemplated in our guidance, so to be clear there. And then you would ask a question and Brian and John should answer too, but on converting our basket or converting those same-day services and as we shared we're seeing a lot of incrementality in those same-day services.",2.5498562,0.747

But our focus really is on being true to the mission that they have and it is Drive Up, we give their bag and they are on their way. We're not going to bother them with a sales pitch.",0.8604175,0.738

I guess first just looking at the comp trends, transactions growth very strong. Over the last couple of quarters your ticket growth has been less of a contributor to comps. And you have a number of initiatives you talked about throughout the call that and theory should be supporting bigger baskets.

TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,207,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think the most important barometer is we're putting great traffic growth on top of strong traffic growth from last year. I think that two year stack on traffic is 8% and we're seeing the guest engaged in more categories, shopping more often. And we're really pleased with the composition of our overall results.",,0.966

And just if I could just follow-up on tariffs, I'm thinking specifically about the flow of inventory. If I go back to third quarter, I think you have some challenges maybe related to the ports, and you also talked about some incremental cost at that point.",,0.625
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,210,Question,2019-05-22,1,2019,Seth Sigman,Credit Suisse,What are you seeing today? And do you feel like you're more prepared to avoid some of the margin pressure you experienced back then? Thanks.,,0.509
TGT-2019-Q1-2019-05-22,211,Answer,2019-05-22,1,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, going back to last year, we made some very specific surgical decisions to invest in inventory, specifically in categories like Toys and Baby and holidays as we're preparing for the season.

Guests like placing order online and picking it up, not far from that home that same day. Since then we've quickly grown the options we offer our guests. They want it next day, same day in their car or at the door; we have a way to deliver. Whether it's same-day delivery shop by Shipt or newer service Drive-Up.

We've run iteration probably number three of that right now. We need to get a little bit further into the Perth before we finalize that. I would tell you the thing we think about is we've move cautiously to start. And the concern is we don't get to shut down a building because we don't get to stop selling for some period of time for the stores that are served by that building. And so, we will move cautiously at the beginning, we want to ensure we don't have buildings that are disrupted during Q4 because we don't want to create problems there.

Can you talk about sort of what you're expecting in terms of share gains within the low to mid-single digit comp and then sales a little bit better? What categories outside toys which will annualize Toys ""R"" Us after the first quarter? What the driver of that is and where you see the opportunity? And then specifically on gross margin, do you expected to be flat in 2019, given that you're scaling the fulfillment options and toys will create some pressure on 1Q, could we see actually gross margin start to improve later in the year and then into 2020?",0.3168236,0.706
TGT-2018-Q4-2019-03-05,233,Answer,2019-03-05,4,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So Chris, when I start with our approach to market share gains, and I'll let Cathy talk little bit about gross margin, but I'll go back to our results in 2018. While we are very excited and Mark and the entire team did a sensational job of taking advantage of the TRU closure, the BRU closures and we took significant share in those categories. In 2018, we grew share across every one of our major categories, in apparel, in home, we had a very strong year in beauty. We grew share in food and beverage. All of our major merchandising categories are growing share right now. We expect that to continue in 2019.",0.1514531,0.985

So we continue to see market share opportunities across our entire portfolio. And obviously, as we see unique opportunities, we'll lean in to take advantage of opportunities category by category. But for this team, they expect to take market share across every one of our major categories in 2019 and take advantage of the opportunities we see in the competitive market.

So let's start with operating income rate, first, because that's the better place to start. We said that we'll see moderate expansion there this year. As we think 2018, 2018 was a good way point as we think about going forward. So we've got enough insight into headwinds and tailwinds that will balance. So then when you move back up, we haven't been as specific between gross margin and SG&A, but we actually don't expect a big change, right. So we already understand where the business is at, we understand Q1 is going be a little lighter on the margin side because of a little bit of mix business that Brian talked about in his prepared remarks.

I guess, my first question is around the new brands in the private brands that you've launched, I think 20 is the number and you said there is more to come.

And I think Bob, it's important to recognize the commitment we've made to our own brand portfolio and the work that's being done by our product development and design teams, our sourcing teams, our merchants, the role that Rick and his team play from a marketing standpoint and then the in-store execution and experience.

The team has made remarkable progress in a short period of time. And I've said this a few times publicly, the team has done three or four years of work in about 18 months to make sure that we took advantage of the opportunity. We're going to be more surgical now, we'll be focused much more around making sure we're managing those brands and building brand management expertise into our teams, but we'll continue to look for white space opportunities and to strengthen our portfolio with great own brands that drive market share gains, drive traffic to our stores and more visits our site, but the team has done a remarkable job and it's certainly been a big part of our market share gains and the change in guest perception as we bring great newness, great quality and value to our portfolio.

So as Brian said a compacted amount of work as we moved into reestablished and stabilized mode of our own brand portfolio and the redefinition and curation of our total portfolio offer.

It was a bold reinvent of a business in kids that was performing in low single-digit growth when the market wasn't. So we said, why change, and all we want to do was connect with our guests and deepen our relationship with them. Two years on what we found is that that's a trusted and beloved brand across the U.S. And if you match that to the sense of authority that we want to create with moms, kids, babies, our most recent market share gains in TRU and BRU exit and the strength of our market share there really starts to build an ecosystem more authority with guests archetypes and relationships, so we can be Americas easiest place to shop.",1.2842262,0.98

Brian, you've had about, I don't know, maybe 50 basis points or so of pressure on the gross margin over the last couple of years from a fulfillment standpoint on digital. It sounds like what you're seeing today is that you expect that pressure to start to ease. Could you just maybe give us a little bit more color around what drives that?

We talked several years ago about the fact that we would be on a path to get to a starting minimum wage of $15, that's built into our plans for future years.

As we thought about 2018, we didn't anticipate that TRU was closing and BRU would be closing. We made big investments to make sure that we were going to garner market share in those important categories. It's going to drive long-term benefits for us, as families come to Target more frequently for toys and items for babies and kids. So that was a long-term investment.

The fact that we had this very unique portfolio, where we're growing market share across all of our categories, but they're still really balanced. 20% of our business in apparel, a very high margin category. 20% in home, a hardline and toy business, it's about 20% of our business.

The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making it our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%.

TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,15,Remarks,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And for us, the distinction between a store sales and a digital sales is largely irrelevant. Because of our unique stores as hub model, more than three quarters of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages, over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pick-up, drive-up and Shipt have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter.",0.7310684,0.743
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,23,Remarks,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than a third of our digital sales. While all three same-day services continued to grow faster than overall digital, drive-up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year.",0.49693,0.0

As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other, that's because we're coming off of 2020 which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced.

The question that I have is when you look at the mix of - especially on the apparel side, can you talk about, you know, any new brands that you're excited about?

Well, why don't I let Christina spend some time talking about what we're seeing with categories, some of the highlights between our own brands and national brands. Obviously, Christina highlighted the fact that, despite our overall robust performance in the quarter own brands grew by 36%, a record performance for us.

They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home. Because as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home.

Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths, and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store, so that we don't end up with what we call INFs or items not found.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So our guests absolutely love that and you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature-controlled products to drive-up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well.",0.9013508,0.893

TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,177,Question,2021-05-19,1,2021,Christopher Horvers,JPMorgan Chase,"Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of questions on guidance. My first question is, in the second quarter, Michael, why couldn't you reach 10% or at least be close to that, you did a 9 8 in 1Q. Sales volumes looked to be similar, is it less rich mix performance or perhaps you're putting in some caution around potential promotions and clearance?",,0.751

Well, we would expect, like I said in my remarks, the second quarter to be far ahead of the 2 year ago performance, likely not as high as last year, but there is still a broad range around that outcome, and so we'll see as the quarter plays out exactly where we land.",0.3782235,0.967
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,179,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Worth noting and I touched on this as well, there is some factors unique to the quarter. We've got a $110 million headwind from the way our returns reserve calendarizes between Q1 and Q2. And the second thing is we're investing and we'll continue to invest in the team and in store payroll to make sure we're staffed and in-stock to support the sales we expect to come and our teams have done just an incredible job this year providing such great guest experience. We want to make sure we're investing to continue to support that and to support growth.",0.1571838,0.917
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,180,Question,2021-05-19,1,2021,Christopher Horvers,JPMorgan Chase,"Understood. And then, as you think about the gross margin, can you talk about the puts and takes of this year versus 2019? Obviously you have a higher e-commerce mix, but you would think that sort of the mix of the business by category could be richer and you also have pretty lean inventories against a strong demand backdrop?",,0.71
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,181,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So maybe I'll speak to actuals and unpack the first quarter just a little bit versus 2 years ago. If you look at kind versus our 2019 performance, we saw markdown efficiency and we've talked about that, lower levels of promotional and clearance markdown rates than 2019.",0.5628326,-0.128

And also on a 2 year basis, you can see digital and supply chain pressure of a shade over a point, given the growth in the digital business and the impact that has to rates. And so, those are familiar drivers, we've talked about over time. Where those drivers land for the balance of the year will dictate where margin ultimately falls.",0.9496521,0.907

Why don't I start and then I'll let John build on my comments. But as I said earlier today, we've been investing in our team for many years now. And we took an industry leading position with our starting minimum wage. We've continued to invest over the last year in the health and wellness and safety of our teams and I think that provide us stability, even deeper engagement with our teams in stores and our teams in supply chain.",1.0028653,0.919
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,190,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C.

TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,191,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Hi, Scott. Just building on what Brian said. Basically, I think our thought has always been the best way to staff our stores and our supply chain frankly is to limit turnover. And so, let's invest in our team, give them a great experience and you've seen us do that for several years now. We've invested in wages. We've invested in benefits. Just as importantly, we've invested in training to help up skill them. And then, over the course of the past year and a half or so, we've invested in safety very overtly.",0.4019648,0.948
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,192,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, as Brian said, engagement is very high, turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store is at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right. We get team members that know their job. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores, because they are in their weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them.",1.0740892,0.918
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,193,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019. So we're just getting started on this journey.

I can start and then maybe John can provide more color on the sortation center work that we're doing. Yeah, we didn't see pressure on the supply chain in digital line this quarter.

TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,204,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But I don't shy away from growth or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omni-channel guests, more guests using drive-up, more guests using same-day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L, because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new drive-up our Shipt guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth and that's how we continue to think about it.",0.469914,0.908
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,205,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. And on the sort centers, Kate, we remain pretty excited about this opportunity.

TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,206,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the play here is a couple of things. And first of all, it's about capacity in the store. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space and that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store and that's an important thing for us.",0.2488743,0.778
TGT-2021-Q1-2021-05-19,207,Answer,2021-05-19,1,2021,Brian C.

This reflects the broad value we deliver across all of our categories and the balance we achieved between our more discretionary areas like apparel, home and beauty and our less discretionary food and beverage and essential categories, which deliver consistent traffic throughout the year. Beyond our frequency categories, throughout the year, we focus on important seasonal moments in our guest lives and unique partnerships that create excitement and sustain our brand. At the beginning of the second quarter, we were really pleased with the guest response to our limited time partnership with Vineyard Vines, which was one of our most successful in our history. And near the end of the quarter, we saw encouraging early results in our back-to-school and back-to-college categories.",1.8501842,0.979

These options offer speed, convenience and reliability and as a result, they are quickly becoming the preferred fulfillment choices for our guests.

Just ahead of the back-to-school season, we launched our new multi-category own brand, More Than Magic, which our team developed to appeal to guests in their tween years. And just this month, based on encouraging results in a 20-store pilot, we expanded our test of Levi's Red Tab denim for both men and women to 50 stores in college campuses and in high-traffic urban markets.

This seasonal spike creates a natural opportunity for us to thoughtfully invest in promotions, allowing us to gain mine share and covert this traffic into additional orders and sales. At the same time, the acceleration in order volume allows us to test the agility of our operations in advance of the fourth quarter peak. I am pleased to report, like last year, performance of our July deal days event was outstanding, both in terms of guest response to our promotions as well as the ability of our operations to handle the surge in demand.",1.2979943,0.986

These outages disappointed our guests. And once again, I want to apologize for the inconvenience it caused. While our business still delivered an outstanding quarter, these outages are a stark reminder of the need for us continue to focus on execution across every aspect of our business every day. On the positive side, I couldn't be more proud of our store teams across the country who out our guest first and worked tirelessly to minimize the inconvenience to our guests.

As we plan for the profitability of those sales, our guidance reflects the most recent announcements about the expected timing of China tariffs. Altogether, based on our performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the back half, we expect to generate full year GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.20, an increase of $0.15 from our prior range. While we certainly see the potential for us to outperform the midpoint of this range, we believe it strikes the appropriate balance between the outstanding trends we have been seeing so far this year and the financial flexibility we will need to manage through a volatile environment.

In the second quarter, these three services accounted for more than a third of our digital sales, up from about 20% last year. In other words our same-day options are growing much faster than our digital sales. Specifically, combined sales for in-store pickup, drive-up and Shipt have more than doubled over the last year, accounting for nearly three quarters of Target's 34% digital comp in the second quarter.",1.7421203,0.557

These are remarkable statistics and they demonstrate how rapidly our guests are learning about and embracing these new convenient options. For many guests, they are becoming the go-to choice for their digital shopping because they offer unique advantages. They are immediate. They allow guests to shop and receive their order on the same day. They are convenient. Guests can choose where they receive their order, either at the front of the store, in the parking lot or at home. They are fast.

Guest don't have to wonder when a package will arrive at their house and what will happen to the package if they are not at home. And of course it eliminates the need to deal with opening and recycling a stack of cardboard boxes every week.

As a result, since the beginning of 2018, order picking efficiency for pickup and drive-up has increased more than 30%. And similarly, end-to-end labor efficiency for our ship from store capability has also improved by more than 30% over that same period.

During seasonal peaks, batches are further segmented into subsections of the store like back-to-school orders this time of the year. Applying new algorithms to prioritize the sequence of order picking based on a range of criteria rather than simply applying a first-in, first-out system, implementing new technology to eliminate ambiguity for our store team members about which work to perform first, when work is due and the optimal box size for packing orders.",1.5259926,0.893

Under the new process, after a guest prints their return label at home and either drops it off or schedule pickup at the home, they receive credit for the return as soon as our third party shipping partners scans the return label. This means that refunds are received in a guest credit or debit card account days earlier than before and our guests have noticed. And our guest survey scores have seen a meaningful improvement in the level of satisfaction for refund timeliness, compared with last year.",1.277937,0.934

As we have been saying for years, we believe that in-store shopping will continue to be important and account for the vast majority of retail sales for many years to come. However, in a world where consumers have more choices than ever, inferior brick-and-mortar experiences will go away.

We continually analyze the results of completed remodels and apply those learnings into our project plans, so next year's remodels won't look the same as the ones we completed last year. We are also finding ways to mitigate the challenges of our guest face when construction is in process, which is leading to smaller average sales disruption than we experienced last year.

This new model is simpler and focused on our guests rather than accomplishing tasks. We have also created more specialized roles in which team members bring their expertise to categories like food, beauty, electronics and apparel.

Beyond the guest experience, we are also seeing the benefit of the operating model in our financial performance. Like everyone else, we are currently experiencing meaningful wage inflation in a very tight labor market.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to talk about our longer term vision for the supply chain. Specifically, I want to address the questions we continue to hear about the long term prospects for our strategy of using our stores as fulfillment hubs. One form of the question is to ask if this strategy is only feasible when Target's digital sales are still small. My first reaction is to wonder if it's appropriate to consider digital sales of well over $5 billion to be small. But I will stick to what's most important and talk about how we expect to deliver much higher volumes of store fulfilled digital sales over time and based on the questions we have been getting from many of you, I want to cover three distinct questions about our capacity to accommodate growth.",1.3020876,0.913
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,38,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The first question pertains to the ability of our stores to fulfill higher levels of digital sales within their existing square footage. On that question, our experience shows that our stores have a very long runway of capacity. Think of it this way. Last year, stores fulfilled sales accounted for an average productivity of just over $300 per square foot and when you do the math, every additional $1 billion of store fulfilled sales would raise that productivity by about $4 a foot. In other words, if we double last year's $5 billion in digital sales and fulfilled all of that extra volume in our stores, we would see our average store sales productivity rise by just over $20 a foot.",1.275481,0.912
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,39,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the question is, can our stores accommodate that volume in their existing space? The answer is clearly, yes. And the easiest way to see that is by looking at the range of productivity of our stores across the chain. Specifically, our top quartile stores, a group consisting more than 450 locations delivered average per foot productivity of more than $430 last year. That's more than $100 higher than the average for the chain. So based on our success in operating that large set of stores, we believe we have a lot of room to grow our overall sales productivity through digital fulfillment.",1.5378633,0.914
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,40,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But there is a second capacity question pertaining to the mix of space in our existing stores. Specifically, we often get asked whether we will need to expand our store backrooms as we continue to see rapid growth in store fulfilled digital sales. On that question, our internal modeling shows that we are not going to run up against any capacity constraints in the near term because our stores already have ample backroom space. Specifically, if we continue to simply apply our existing technology and processes and maintained a rapid rate of growth in store fulfilled sales, we wouldn't need additional store backroom capacity until well into the next decade.",0.8763815,0.922
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,41,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And as an aside, that constraint would only occur during the two week long seasonal spike in the fourth quarter. However, we will only run up against that constraint if our technology and processes stay the same as they are today and that isn't our plan, just as our stores have consistently delivered ever higher productivity in their ability to fulfill conventional sales, we are investing in technology and processes that will allow our stores to continue to grow their backroom productivity as well.",1.6872698,0.802
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,42,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond the capacity of our stores and backrooms, the third capacity question we hear is whether, over time, we are going to need to invest in additional upstream distribution capacity to accommodate our growth. And for this question, our answer is clearly yes. But that shouldn't surprise anybody because we have been adding capacity throughout more than 50 years of growth in our stores. In other words, when you grow any type of sales, either a conventional store sales or a digital sale, eventually you will need that network capacity to serve the additional volume. But that doesn't mean we are sitting on a surprise addition to the CapEx plans we outlined at this year's financial community meeting. The capital plan we outlined that day already accounted for expected future investments in upstream capacity based on our plans to grow both store sales and digital sales in the years ahead. So in other words, adding network capacity isn't something beyond our plan, it's part of the plan we have already articulated.",1.507982,0.915

When we started, many people didn't think we would be able to grow store traffic and sales ever again. When we started, many people questioned whether store should play a central role in digital fulfillment. And when we announced our goal to move to a $15 minimum wage across the country by the end of 2020, many people didn't think we could accommodate those kinds of wage increases and generate profitable growth.

Results within essentials and beauty was strongest in baby, beauty and over-the-counter. Baby has been one of our strongest share stories for the last year and we saw continued gains in the second quarter. Beauty has also been on an amazing run as we have seen accelerating share gains for well over a year. In apparel, in the second quarter, we saw broad strength across a host of categories, including intimates and sleepwear, jewelry, accessories and shoes, baby and performance activewear. We were particularly pleased to see such strong trends at Target despite unfavorable weather trends during the quarter and soft sales conditions for the overall industry.

In food, results were led by adult beverages, which delivered another quarter of double digit growth. In home, results were led by decor. In hardlines this quarter, comp sales were approximately flat overall. Results were led by toys where growth continues at a more moderate pace, given that we annualize the closure of Toys ""R"" Us during the quarter. In addition, we saw healthy growth in our mobile category during the quarter. These areas of strengths were offset by comp declines in our electronics and entertainment categories, reflecting in overall lack of industry newness in their product assortments.

Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"Our team developed this brand to appeal to tween girls who are looking to move beyond Cat & Jack, but aren't quite ready to move up to a juniors assortment and brands like Wild Fable. Central to the More Than Magic brand is a theme of empowerment through positive messaging on products like apparel and notebooks. In addition, based on feedback we received from both tweens and their parents, all the beauty products in this new brand are made without parabens and weren't tested on animals. We are really excited to launch this new brand at a time when many more mall-based alternatives are closing their doors and we have been very pleased with the early results since the launch.",2.8958333,0.984

As Brian mentioned, earlier this month, we expanded our pilot with Levi's in which we are offering products with the iconic Red Tab label for the first time. Based on the success of our pilot in which we offered men's Red Tab products in 20 stores, we just added another 30 stores to the test and we have expanded the assortment to feature items for both men and women including jeans, tops and jackets. Of course, we are now offering the entire assortment on target.com and given that Levi's is one of the most searched brands on our website, we are excited to offer our digital guest access this iconic label for the first time.",2.172123,0.908

Then, as today, our goal was to democratize the marketplace and offer incredible design at an affordable price, something we called Design For All. So after 20 years and more than 175 different partnerships, this quarter we are going to celebrate by opening the archives and bringing back nearly 300 items from 20-plus design partnerships and feature them in our anniversary collection. Prices will range from $6 up to $160, with most items priced below $50 and reflecting our commitment to inclusivity, all of the women's apparel items will be available in extended sizing.

Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"And finally, the food and beverage team is looking forward to the upcoming launch of our new own brand, Good and Gather, which we just announced earlier this week. We know that food and beverage is a big reason our guests like shopping at Target since nearly three quarters of our baskets have at least one food item in them. And driven by the improvements we have implemented over the last two years, we have been seeing consistent growth and market share gains in food and beverage for well over a year. To build on this momentum, it's critical that our approach to every aspect of our food offering from selection to presentation brings joy to our guest lives.

Good and Gather will become Target's flagship food brand with extensions focused on kids, organic and signature product lines. It will launch with over 650 items from dairy to produce, ready-made pastas and meat to granola bars and sparkling water. And by the full set next year, it will 2,000-plus products strong.

That's how we deliver on the pay less side of our brand promise whether offering organic pasta or a fashion item from a low-cost designer, all delivered at an accessible price. When you come to work at Target, the first thing you notice is the quality of the team, their passion for our business and their pride in working for this low-cost company and iconic brand.

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,57,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Thanks Mark. As Brian mentioned, we saw outstanding financial performance in the second quarter as our business delivered sales growth that was in line with our expectations and bottomline results that were well above our expectations. Our comp sales growth of 3.4% on top of 6.5% last year put our two-year stacked growth at about 10%, our best performance in more than a decade.",1.6759348,0.967
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,58,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Within our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 1.5% and our comparable digital sales grew 34% on top of 41% growth a year ago. Among the drivers of total comp growth, we saw a 2.4% increase in traffic combined with a 0.9% increase in average ticket. We have long said that we are focused on driving traffic because it is a key indicator of Target's relevance with consumers. That's why we continue to be encouraged that traffic is growing both in our stores and our digital channels. And notably, this quarter, we were facing a really strong traffic comparison of 6.4% a year ago, meaning that our business just delivered the strongest two-year traffic performance we have ever reported.",1.7900288,0.968
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,59,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"On the gross margin line, second quarter performance exceeded our expectations as the rate expanded from 30.3% last year up to 30.6% this year. This was the first time in nearly three years that we have seen a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate. This performance reflected the ongoing work of our merchant teams to optimize assortment, costs, pricing and promotions across all of our categories. In addition, we saw about 20 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, reflecting really strong apparel performance, combined with a moderating growth rate in toys and baby. These tailwinds were partially offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs.",2.1764142,0.743
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,60,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Even though we continue to grow digital sales at a very rapid pace, we are seeing less pressure from fulfillment costs, given that we are leveraging our store's teams and assets to fulfill the vast majority of our digital volume. And as Brian and John described, we are seeing incredibly rapid growth of low-cost digital fulfillment options like in-store pickup and drive-up. As a result, gross margin rate pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs in this year's second quarter was about half of the amount we were seeing a year ago.",2.2008629,0.47
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,61,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Moving down to the SG&A expense line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement in the second quarter. This performance was also better than expected and was driven by multiple factors, including favorability in asset impairments and the timing benefit of marketing and store expenses that will come back later in the year. In addition, our expense performance continues to reflect remarkable discipline across our entire organization which is key to sustaining outstanding performance over time. As John mentioned earlier, an important example is our store teams who are delivering meaningful productivity improvement that are helping us to offset the impact of rapidly rising wages across the country.",2.0743049,0.978
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,62,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense rate was approximately flat to last year as an increase in D&A expense dollars was offset by the benefit of higher sales. Given recent changes to our investment plans, we are now planning for higher accelerated depreciation than we originally expected for the year. One example relates to investments that will allow our stores to accommodate high volume of pickup and drive-up orders during the holiday season. For stores that have particularly high volumes of pickup and drive-up orders, we will be deploying flexible fixtures that will allow the stores to temporarily expand their holding capacity at the front of the store during periods of peak demand. This will allow the stores to maintain their high level of performance in fulfilling pickup and drive-up orders, a key reason we have seen such rapid adoption of these services.",1.9448706,0.933
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,63,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"In total, our business saw a meaningful improvement in our second quarter operating margin rate, which expanded about 80 basis points from 6.4% last year to 7.2% this year. As Brian mentioned, this was well ahead of our expectations, putting us in a great position to deliver outstanding financial performance for the full year.",2.5412272,0.938
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,64,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Moving further down the P&L, second quarter interest expense was up $5 million from second quarter 2018, reflecting higher average debt balances compared with a year ago. And our income tax rate was 23%, consistent with the expected range for the year. As a result, net earnings from continuing operations grew $139 million over last year, an increase of 17.4%. At the end of the quarter, our diluted share count was about 3.8% lower than a year ago, reflecting our continued disciplined approach to capital deployment. Putting all this together, our business generated GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.82, both more than 20% higher than a year ago, setting new record highs for the company.",2.0584851,0.612
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,65,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So now I want to turn to cash flow, capital deployment and return on invested capital. But first I want to reiterate our priorities for capital deployment, which have been consistent for decades. As we look to deploy our cash, we first fully invest in capital projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and extend our record of annual dividend increases, which we have maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we deploy any excess cash beyond those two uses for share repurchase within the limits of our middle-A credit rating.",1.7094919,0.854
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,66,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So how have these priorities played out in 2019. Through the first half of the year, our operations have generated about $2.8 billion in cash, up from about $2.7 billion in the first half of 2018. We have deployed that cash to invest about $1.4 billion in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $658 million and repurchased $618 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest about $3.5 billion dollars in CapEx, driven by our remodel program, other investments in store assets, new store openings and in our supply chain and technology capabilities. Looking beyond 2019, we anticipate a similar amount of CapEx in 2020 as we expect to maintain our current remodel pace of about 300 stores for one additional year. Beyond 2020, we expect to moderate the pace of our remodels to a longer term range of 150 to 200 a year. And as a result, beginning in 2021, we expect to see a moderation in the pace of annual CapEx into the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, closer to the level of D&A on our cash flow statement.",2.2737296,0.477
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,67,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So now I want to finish my review of our second quarter results by discussing our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of both our operating results and our capital deployment decisions. For the trailing 12-months through the second quarter, excluding discrete impacts of the 2017 tax reform legislation, our business generated an after-tax return on invested capital of 15%, compared with 14.2% a year ago. This is outstanding performance and it's even more encouraging to see the year-over-year improvement which clearly demonstrates the benefit of our consistent disciplined approach to capital deployment.",0.4496644,0.951
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,68,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Turning to our guidance for the back half of the year, I will start with our expectations for comparable sales growth. As Brian mentioned, we expect our business to generate comp sales increases in both the third and fourth quarters, in line with the 3.4% comp growth we just delivered in the second quarter. This expectation recognizes recent trends, now that we fully annualized the closure of Toys ""R"" Us stores as well as our bottom-up plans for sales driving initiatives in the back half of the year. On the operating income line, we are expecting our third quarter rate will be flat to up slightly, reflecting unexpected improvement in our gross margin rate offset by pressure on the SG&A expense line. Our gross margin rate expectation reflects last year's supply chain and inventory related pressures that we don't expect to occur again this year. On the SG&A expense line, our expectation reflects the plans re-timing of spending within marketing and our store's teams from the second quarter into the third quarter. And as Brian mentioned, our outlook for the back half of the year includes expected cost resulting from the most recent announcements regarding China tariff.",1.8561841,-0.169
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,69,Remarks,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Putting together all of our expectations, we are anticipating third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.04 to $1.24. For the full year, our expectations reflect strong trends through the first half of the year, the re-timing of marketing and store cost into the back half of the year, updated expectations for accelerated depreciation and expected costs related to tariffs, including the increases currently scheduled for September and December. Reflecting all of these considerations, we expect to deliver full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $5.90 to $6.20, which is $0.15 higher than our previous range. The midpoint of this new range of approximately 10% higher than last year's GAAP EPS from continuing operations and 12% higher than last year's adjusted EPS.

It reflects years of work by our team to transform our business and build a durable financial model. And it reflects our teams' passion for our guests and a relentless focus on strong execution every day. When we first announced our transformation plan at the beginning of 2017, we talked about the assets we had at our disposal, including well-maintained and well-located stores, powerful owned brands, an iconic Target brand, a strong balance sheet and a business that generates robust cash flow. But what was most important, both in 2017 and today, is the team that powers our business.

Before we move to your questions, I want to take a moment and acknowledge that my first Target earnings call was almost exactly five years ago today. And I think we all agree that Target has changed a lot in those five years. During that time, we exited our Canadian segment allowing our teams to devote all of their energy to our U.S. operations. We sold our pharmacy business to CVS, a transaction that has generated value for both companies. We rejuvenated our own brand portfolio, launching dozens of new brands across multiple categories. We went from simply selling on a website to integrating digital within every part of our business, positioning our stores at the center of the most comprehensive suite of digital fulfillment options in the U.S. We opened about 100 small format stores, reaching new neighborhoods in dense urban areas and around college campuses.

But what's most amazing is the patience and optimism that this team has shown over the last five years as we have handled some significant challenges together. That's why it's so rewarding to be able to share the amazing results that this team is delivering today. At the same time, we are focused on the need to stay hungry, see around corners and continually innovate and reinvent ourselves. The pace of change in our business doesn't look like it's poised to slow down anytime soon.

You had the register glitch on Father's Day weekend that some people pegged a 50 basis point headwind to comps. You had the weather. So can you shed any light on the cadence of the quarter in light of the weather? How mature was the Father's Day weekend glitch and the impact to comps? And then more broadly, the gains in apparel and continued gains in baby, what would you sort of rank order the big drivers that are allowing you to gain that share?",,0.951

And I think as we look at the quarter, we saw very consistent performance throughout the 13 weeks of the quarter. And as I have said several times now, there is not one element that we can point to. We saw a very good response from both sides of our portfolio, both our style side and our essentials. Mark called out the strength that we saw in categories like apparel, but also strength in those household essentials that drive traffic to our stores and more and more visits to our site.",0.271797,0.878
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,78,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it was a very balanced quarter, strength across our entire portfolio. And I think the team has been just very focused on executing our plans, both from a store standpoint and a digital standpoint. So it all added up to a very solid quarter. We think we delivered quality results throughout the quarter that led to traffic gains of 2.4%, a very strong comp, market share gains in many of our core categories and overall obviously delivered very strong bottomline performance. So I can't point to one specific element.",1.2689316,0.966

And the investments we made in store remodels, the investments we are making in new small formats continue to perform very well. As we continue to scale and mature our suite of fulfillment options, the guest is reacting honestly very well to those options. We continue to see a great reaction to both our own brands and our national brand performance.

Obviously, your inventory is flat year-over-year. But could you perhaps talk about how you look at the health of your inventory, particularly in the more seasonally sensitive areas?

Obviously, the strength of our performance in categories like apparel speaks for itself. But I think as we prepare for these big seasonal moments, I think we feel like we are in a great position for back-to-school and back-to-college. I would actually say it's the strongest position we have had in years as we get ready for the peak of college. And as we get ready for back-to-school that continue to surge over the next few weeks, I think we feel very good about our position and I think it's actually the best inventory position we have had in years in both of those categories.",1.1494065,0.983

So first off, the magnitude of the expenses, both in marketing and our stores, as you have seen already beginning in Q3, we have got some amazing plans in Q3. So we just had some expenses to support those plans and it's probably in 40 basis point range, maybe a little lower -- sorry, $40 million range and maybe a little bit lower going from Q2 into Q3.

But as it's stated today, the impact of List 4 would be something that we would realize in the first quarter of 2020.",0.7580843,0.556

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,94,Question,2019-08-21,2,2019,Robert Ohmes,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"Good morning guys and congrats on a great quarter in a tricky environment out there. I was hoping to get some of you to talk more about the digital growth outlook. So digital came in, I think, well above what a lot of people were looking for. How should we think about that growth going forward? I think you guys had pegged it around 25% for the year. Can you do a lot better than that? And maybe an update on how many store pick-up locations and drive-up locations you are at or you may be accelerating that? And are more categories coming into pick-up and drive-up, like fresh produce, et cetera? Just any help you can give us there would be great. Thanks.",1.6066423,0.988

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Robby, why don't we let John kind of walk through some of the highlights of our digital performance, which again was very strong during the quarter, up 34% on top of significant growth last year.",0.0609906,0.831
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,96,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Robby, good question on the kind of some of the same-day fulfillment. We are really excited about what we continue to see there across pick-up, drive-up and Shipt. That was about three quarters of the digital growth was represented by same-day. It's a third of the business now and growing very, very quickly. So we are excited about that. Pick-up is nationwide and it has been nationwide for several years. Drive-up is very close to being nationwide. It will be largely done here as we get through the third quarter.",1.760131,0.923
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,97,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And your question about fresh is a good one. Something we are working hard on, piloting here in the Twin Cities and looking to understand the operational needs there a little bit more as we get through the back half of this year and then be back to tell you more about how we plan to scale that as we get into early next year. But I think when you put those three together, drive-up, pick-up and Shipt, we have got a great offering that our guest is clearly responding to. They are our cheapest fulfillment methods, so most profitable for Target. They are our fastest and we really see guest adoption taking off. So we are excited about the combination there.",1.6054032,0.95
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,98,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, Robby, as we noted during our prepared remarks, same-day represents a third of our fulfillment and it's growing at a rate of 2X versus last year. And as we continue to build awareness through our marketing campaign, what we are doing from our in-store standpoint, our network standpoint as well as our digital communication to the guest, we are building awareness and we are seeing continued growth in that space. So we would expect those fulfillment channels, which obviously are our most profitable way to fill digital orders, to continue to grow over the balance of the year.",1.5857552,0.859

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,100,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Robby, it's something that we do not provide guidance around. But what we have said for a number of years now is we expect to outgrow the overall industry by at least a rate of 2X. And as you have seen recently, we have been growing at three times the average rate of the digital growth in the industry.",1.1530905,0.557

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,105,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. This is a journey the store team has been on for several years and really around raising our level of service in the stores. The biggest change around the actual operating model itself, historically, we kind of had a jack of all trades model. You would be a cashier day, go do price change, go do some planogram sets, whatever we needed you to do in general. Today, we have gotten far more specialized.",1.2701596,0.402
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,106,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So people in the food area actually can speak about perishables. They are doing the ordering. They are responsible for that area. They are responsible for the out-of-stocks. Same for beauty. They can talk to our guests about beauty. They are in that area all day long. It's the only area they work in. They are responsible for the inventory that sits in the back room related to that area and keeping the floor full and interacting with our guests.,1.7981989,0.926

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,108,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C.

Keep the store full. And so we are excited about actually implementing that across the chain this quarter. The teams continue to work through that. But the early results are very positive.",1.4703234,0.843

And then maybe for Mark, just there's been a number of own brand introductions over the last year or two, a very healthy pace. How do we think about that going forward? Does that continue? Or have you guys reached a point here where you have addressed the areas and you are going to just see how a lot of these kind of play out?",,0.945
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,110,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Mark J. Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"Yes, Peter. I think we addressed this last quarter as well. I mean, we expect the rate of change and newness to abate, but still sustain a level of newness to create interest for our guest. I think one of the things we are most buoyed by out of this quarterly performance is, we had a high degree of own brand launches, specifically in our home areas last year and we had really strong traffic and growth. Yet, we are anniversarying that yet another quarter. And I think it just goes to show the building blocks that these brands built to us in terms of preference for Target, but also how they create sustainable growth and long term value.",1.0391865,0.975
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,111,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, Peter, we will expect to see the rate of new brand introduction slow, but Mark and his team are very focused on bringing newness and innovation to the own brands that we have launched over the last couple of years. So we will continue to make sure those brands are on trend. We bring newness and freshness to those brands that have been successfully launched over the last couple of years.

Just to clarify, it looks to us that for List 4 for you guys might be 80% of what you import or as you would have seen some experience from Lists 1 to 3.

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,117,Question,2019-08-21,2,2019,Gregory Melich,MoffettNathanson,"Okay. Fair enough. On the digital, I did want to understand a little bit more, just given the strength of the traffic about the nature of the customer. I see REDcard has been sort of flat, but are you getting a higher spend per trip from people using same-day? Is it existing customers coming more frequently? Are you finding new customers as a result of this?",0.9495317,0.598

And Cathy talked about the fact that in this last quarter, it is a record high two-year stack for traffic growth. So we are seeing our Target guests visit us more frequently, shop more categories. They are enjoying the changes we have made in the store experience, but they are also taking advantage of the convenient fulfillment options that we are offering.",1.3258289,0.813
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,119,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C.

In over, now 1,550 locations, they can place an order and pull into our parking lot. We have Shipt shoppers that will deliver within a couple of hours to their home.",0.9336881,0.0

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,124,Question,2019-08-21,2,2019,Chris Mandeville,,"Hi. Good morning. Just sticking with the digital conversation. Since you already referenced your performance versus expectations and gave us a little color right there from Greg's question, I guess I was just kind of curious about how same-day specifically is contributing to the comp? It was roughly, I think, 50% last quarter, now over 80%. Is there any way of breaking down the service modalities between pick-up, drive-up and Shipt and how they are contributing there? And then, Cathy, how did the service models in aggregate influence the margin in the quarter?",,0.665
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,125,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think we have said during the prepared comments that we are seeing honestly exceptional growth in our lower cost digital fulfillment options. And one of the things that John pointed out very clearly during our last Financial Community Conference is, as we shift our fulfillment from upstream DCs to our stores, we see our cost go down by upwards of 40%. When it moves to one of our same-day options, pick up in-store, drive-up or Shipt, we see a 90% reduction in that cost. So obviously, as we are seeing the acceleration of our same-day convenient options, more guests opting to order online and pick-up or use drive-up or Shipt, we are seeing the benefits of that flowing through our P&L.",1.1698731,0.9
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,126,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes. So I was just going to add on, as we shared in the prepared remarks, we are seeing, because of that shift, almost half the pressure that we saw the same time a year ago on our gross margin. So we showed that 30 basis points of pressure for fulfillment and supply chain costs this quarter and that's almost half of what it was last year so we are seeing that movement and the adoption towards the same-day services are closer to the store.",1.9511026,0.007

TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,128,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I think the store teams have done an outstanding job of initially getting these services up and running and providing a great guest experience. That's the place to start always and that's what they did. I think since that time, as we have begun to roll, we have rolled these out and scaled them, the stores have done a great job going back, process reengineering, adding tools, adding technology to make all of it easier and faster for our teams.",1.6393778,0.957
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,129,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Brian C.

Could you unpack the gross margin commentary about merchandising efforts to optimize cost, pricing, promotions and assortment? And the reason why is because I think there are questions about the sustainability of those factors. It does seem like you are expecting those to continue to drive benefit, given your commentary around gross margin in the third quarter.",1.0225133,0.66

So first off, we had a terrific performance across the board by our team. So our merchant team from assortment to cost to price to promo, they managed the business throughout the entire quarter from the beginning of the quarter with Vineyard Vines through back-to-school, back-to-college with the cyber event in the middle. So amazing performance across the board. And by the way, we have got tremendous plans for Q3 and Q4 as well.",1.9760307,0.852
TGT-2019-Q2-2019-08-21,137,Answer,2019-08-21,2,2019,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So I would tell you that they are sustainable type of efforts that we continue to do. And then we got a little bit of favorable mix with the strength of the apparel categories and little softening of the growth of toys and baby as we have now anniversaried the Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us exits.

But I think that the agility and strength that Jill Sando and team brought to the apparel business in the quarter in terms of inventory management, markdown management and sales and share gains is definitely one of those strong contributors in our mix.

And really complement Mark and his entire merchandising team for the work that they have done. We have been talking now for multiple years about the benefits of our multi-category portfolio.

This increase was driven by traffic growth of more than 6% an unprecedented number and by far the strongest performance, since we began reporting this metric in 2008.",0.3286942,0.957
TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,9,Remarks,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Total sales were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting 0.5 point of growth from our new and non-mature stores. Store comparable sales increased nearly 5%, and digital sales grew more than 40% in the second quarter as guests continued to respond to a growing menu of convenient fulfillment options, newness around our merchandising categories, freshly remodeled stores and a higher level of service across the chain.",0.2087597,0.66
TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,10,Remarks,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On top of the strong digital sales trend, we've been seeing for many years, we saw a meaningful incremental lift from our one-day sale in July, which came in far ahead of expectations. With very strong traffic both in-store and online, we saw accelerating comp sales trends in all five of our core merchandising categories. While there are healthy increases across the board, comp growth in our Home category was amazingly strong, up nearly 10%. Hardlines also saw high-single digit comp growth driven by strength in both toys and electronics.",0.5878019,0.972
TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,11,Remarks,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And with stronger than expected sales, our business delivered stronger than expected profitability. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.47 was near to the high-end of the guidance range of $1.30 to $1.50. This represents about 20% growth compared with the year ago, despite the fact that our results continue to reflect significant investments in both capital and operating income to position Target for long-term success. These investments include our plan to perform wall-to-wall remodels of approximately 1,000 stores over a 3-year period. Our work to complete the transform, Target supply chain, placing our stores at the center of a modern network design to deliver an unmatched combination of convenient fulfillment options; opening new small format stores across the country allowing us to reach guests we couldn't serve with our larger formats; last year's investments to ensure we're priced right daily in support of the Pay Less side of our brand promise; our work to deliver a constant drum beat of new and exciting merchandize throughout our owned and exclusive brand portfolio; the rollout of new convenient digital capabilities that make it easier and more inspiring for guests to shop, save and use their REDcard, and most importantly investments in hours, wages and training for our team members. These investments enable our team to deliver higher levels of service and productivity and our guests are responding to the change. We embarked on this investment plan at the beginning of 2017 and our progress so far has been well ahead of our original expectations.",0.1756038,0.99

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There is no doubt that like others, we're currently benefitting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career. But market share data demonstrates that our current results are benefitting from more than just the environment, as we're seeing broad market share gains across categories we sell. The question we continue to hear from many of you is whether we can separately measure the benefit of each of these investments we're making. And the honest answer is we can't evaluate each one of them in isolation. Instead, it's the collective benefit of all of these initiatives that is keeping Target more top of mind with guests, enticing them to visit our stores and our site more often.",0.1444945,0.974

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Before I turn to our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond, let me comment briefly on the topic of tariffs. Like many of you, we've been carefully monitoring recent tariff announcements. And we are aware of the potential for the situation to further escalate. As we said many times, as a guest-focused retailer, we're concerned about tariffs because they would increase prices on everyday products for American families. In addition, a prolonged deterioration in global trade relationships could damage economic growth and vitality in the United States. Given these risks, we have been expressing our concerns to our leaders in Washington, both on our own and along with other retailers and trade association partners. However, our concern is centered on the impact of tariffs, on consumers and the economy, not our ability to manage our business in the face of these challenges.",0.6344658,0.722

While we always account for risks like these when we plan for the future, today, we are also focused on the multiple opportunities we see in front of us.",0.2103971,0.813

As a result, we have updated our comp guidance, and we are now planning for comp growth in the back half of the year in line with what we've seen in the front half. In addition, we have also updated our full year EPS expectations. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. These upgrades to our outlook reflect the current trends we're seeing across our business, including a very strong start to back-to-school and back-to-college. In addition, we continue to focus on unique opportunities in key Toy and Baby categories, given the recent closure of Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us across the country. And of course, as the year progresses, we'll continue to benefit from the broader rollout of new fulfillment capabilities like Drive-Up and Shipt, brand launches in multiple categories, the completion of additional remodels and the opening of more small-format stores.",0.261973,0.955

When we move beyond testing to scaling, we'll see efficiencies and cost savings further strengthening our guest experience and overall position in the marketplace, and importantly by the end of 2020, we'll have a newly refreshed base of stores, reflecting our plan to complete more than 1,100 remodels in a 4-year period through 2020.",0.3180516,0.949

As I have discussed with many of you, the operations team faces a fundamental challenge in delivering on our strategic initiatives as we work to make changes to virtually every facet of our operations, modernizing our supply chain, delivering new fulfillment options and increasing efficiency in our stores.

We completed remodels of 113 stores in the second quarter on top of the 56 we completed in the first quarter and many more are underway. In fact, in July, we had 258 locations undergoing a remodel during at least the portion of the month, the highest at any kind in our history. While our remodel project creates an optimal platform for all of our fulfillment initiatives, it also provides our guests with the more inspiring environment that's easier to shop. And our guests continue to respond by shopping more often, specifically consistent with our plan. We continue to see traffic driven incremental sales lift of 2% to 4% in our remodel stores following completion of the remodel.

And in Food and Beverage, we are changing how the team accomplishes everyday task allowing more opportunities for guest to interact with experts on the sales floor, while also standardizing operations to ensure we have fresh and full presentations, a focus on food safety and a strong and efficient foundation for how we operate.

However this quarter we saw a step-up in the pace of growth, and a lot of that acceleration was driven by a one-day sale in July.

Our second quarter financial performance exceeded our expectations on both the top-line and the bottom line reflecting the benefit of our strategic initiatives in a very strong consumer environment. As Brian mentioned, our second quarter comp sales increase of 6.5%, is the strongest we've seen at Target in 13 years.

In our last quarterly call, when describing our first quarter traffic increase of 3.7%, we described it as the strongest result we had ever reported since we began reporting this metric in 2008.

However, in the second quarter, this headwind was almost completely offset by the benefit of our merchandising initiatives, including ongoing cost saving efforts and the benefit of our work on pricing and promotions.

With this updated mix expectations, we are now planning for a gross margin rate decline of 30 to 40 basis points in the third quarter. Combining that expectation with our forecast for a slight increase in our SG&A expense rate and a small amount of rate favorability on the D&A expense lines, we are planning for a 20 to 30 basis points decline in our operating income margin rate in the third quarter.

So the guidance seems to imply, I guess, slightly better operating profit growth in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, it was up, and it was up for the first time in a very long time, which is nice to see, but it was down for the full first half on similar comps to what you're assuming for the second half. So could you just remind us of some of the drivers? And Cathy, we got the margin commentary, but could you just help us a little bit more with some of the levers as we move into the second half of the year, some of the cost savings and other opportunities that will help support that operating profit growth.

And as we think about updating our guidance for the remainder of the year, we expect consistent sales. So first on the top line, we see the back half and we've got plans for consistent sales growth in that same range, which is, obviously, very strong consistent with the traffic and sales we've been seeing. And then on profitability, we see a great opportunity to continue to take share and go after some categories, specifically Toys and Baby. So we baked that in into the back half of the year. So all of that said, we'll continue investing in both the fulfillment aspects, which are coming through in gross margin and then the category mix. And then on the SG&A line, we'll continue to invest in our stores. All of that said, we expect the back half of the year for a slight deterioration in Op income margin rates.",0.4276127,0.967

We're seeing a very strong start to back-to-school and back-to-college. We continue to see very strong traffic trends, and we expect to monetize that in the back half of the year. So you should expect continued strong performance from Target throughout 2018, but it also sets us up for a very strong performance as we go into 2019 and beyond.

TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,85,Answer,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I'll start with each one of our key initiatives is ahead of the schedule that we have set 18 months ago. We continue to see really positive responses from our store remodels. And John mentioned that in the month of July alone, we had over 250 stores under construction. In each and every market, we're seeing really strong guest response to those reimaged stores. Our new small formats continue to impress and are driving productivity from a sales standpoint that are beyond our expectations. The reaction that the guests have had to our new brands has been spectacular in Home, in Apparel, and now in Electronics. And each one of the fulfillment capabilities continues to deliver a great response from the guests. John talked about the Net Promoter Scores we're getting for a service like Drive-Up that will bring to scale for the holiday season. The reaction we're getting in each and every market to Shipt and the quality of Shipt shoppers that are servicing their members. In urban markets like New York or Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, DC, the ability to shop our urban small formats and then hours later have someone deliver that package to your doorstep for a $7 charge, very well received. And the investments that we've made in our store teams and putting more expertise in departments like Beauty and Apparel, in Food and Beverage, in technology, the reaction we're getting from our guests exceeded our expectations. So all of our key initiatives as they're working together as one are ahead of the schedule that we would have set 18 months ago. And now as we move into the holiday season, we'll have more of those at scale, and as we move into '19, we'll be further ahead of the original plan that we'd established back in February 2017. So each one of the key elements is working ahead of the schedule that we have set back in February 2017, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. And as you heard me say numerous times, the traffic number to me is the most important measure that our strategy is connecting with the consumer both in our stores and online.

And it's weird and again you've heard us talk about this before, the continued performance of our own brand plays a very prominent role in allowing us to manage our mix, to have a category like Home grow at almost 10%, driven by some great new brand launches, led by made by design during the quarter.

What are your thoughts on managing that in the context of what you've been doing in the consumer environment? You've done a really good job with that gross margin rate. And shifts about value and how you continue to communicate that. Also, we were curious about the loyalty program.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Oliver, why I don't start with loyalty, and then let Mark talk about our continued efforts to support our price rate daily positioning. The loyalty program is off to a very solid start in the Dallas market. We're watching that carefully. John Mulligan, are actually going to be heading down there this week to assess the program and our performance in the market still, in a very early stage. But as we think about 2019 and beyond, we've certainly expect our Target loyalty program, Target Red, to play a very important role in building even greater engagement and loyalty with our guests, so lot more to come as we get into 2019 and think about loyalty.

Tritton,Chief Merchandising Officer & Executive VP,"I think that the work we did with priced right daily beginning in 2017 and our opening price point stands, which really spans how we're pricing every day both in national brand and owned brand, has been really key to part of the traffic generation, and seeing consistent flow of whether it's in stock-up or more importantly in fill-in trips that are changing our frequency business, but also across the board, make it very easy for the guest to shop in-store and online with great transparency and simplicity of pricing. So we've been able to exercise great pricing, communicate simply to the guests. And we're getting credit for that.

What are your thoughts about the state of speed and stock levels? And we saw a lot of the technology and thoughts you have ahead at your Investor Day, at Target Lab.

The challenge for us is balancing, changing the business where we operate the business. And as you said, we showed you a lot of what we're doing to change the business. We'll start to scale-in a lot of that work in 2019. And that has the opportunity to significantly move our capabilities forward as we begin to scale that work. I think right now, we've said as the sales accelerated, particularly in Q2, Q1 to Q2, there are some areas where we've been spotting on in-stocks and we're not happy with that. And you see the response in our inventory, we've -- we're flowing goods in a little bit earlier for Q4, so that we can flow them to the stores appropriately. We've taken positions and things like A&A basics, things like denim, chinos, where last year, frankly the new brands came out, and we were almost immediately out of stock. We've made investments there. And then we're working hard on food and beverage. And as Mark said, we're gaining share for six quarters in a row. So we're learning to how to operate that business both differently in the store and in the supply chain. So we feel good about the progress we've made, but we are not satisfied with our current in-stock position. There is more work to do there.",0.5268113,0.804

Well, this was a really strong quarter for the company. And when we think about comps at 6.5%, the strong comps in store, the acceleration in digital there is a lot to be proud of. But we know we've done a lot of work to do. And we've got to make sure that we're not meeting the demand that's taking place within our system. So John is very focused on that to make sure that we improve our in-stock position, but we've seen obviously a step function change in demand in our stores and online, accelerated growth. We're chasing some of that growth right now and we've got to continue to make sure that we're doing a better job of replenishing our system as we go into the back half of the year, and particularly as we get ready for continued strong growth in 2019.",1.1342612,0.989

At the Analyst day, earlier this year, you called out 2018 as an investment year and you're reiterating your view of profitable growth in 2019 and beyond. Can you frame that how you think of that in terms of the margin rates in the business, including gross margin and operating income rate? Could we see flat grosses in '19, and up OI rate?

But I would refer you back to Cathy's comments earlier. When we look at our second quarter progress, really strong gross margin rate for a company that grew at our level. And for the first time in a while, operating income is growing from a dollar standpoint. So now we're seeing some improvement in our performance.

And then in terms of the e-commerce growth, you call that a big lift from the one-day sale, but at the same time you're scaling a lot of fulfillment options into the back half. So do you think you can maintain sort of that 40% online sales growth into the back half and how much of that contributes to the updated comp outlook versus say, share in Baby and Toys in these key seasons coming up?",,0.791

But we expect very strong digital growth in the back half. Obviously we're guiding to comp sales that are going to be very consistent with our first half performance. You're going to continue to see us scale up, Drive-Up and Shipt, same day delivery in urban markets. So that's going to play a very meaningful role.

Stores did almost five comps by themselves, and obviously our stores are fulfilling much of that 41% digital growth. And so we're well over our two thirds of that digital growth is being fulfilled out of our store. And so we're blurring those lines every single day making sure we have a great experience to our guests and letting them choose to shop how they want to engage with Target. And so we're going to start talking less and less at some point about an actual digital comp because it is truly our entire business fueled by those stores.",0.6131352,0.966

TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,118,Question,2018-08-22,2,2018,Matthew McClintock,Lehman Brothers,"Brian, I was wondering if I could ask a macro question. So the broader retail industry has truly enjoyed a resurgence across the board this quarter. Target seems to standout because of traffic, as you've highlighted. But I was wondering if I get your thoughts on what's driving this? Why does the consumer -- the American consumer all of a sudden just wake up and start going to retailers again? And then, thinking forward, how should we think about Target's strength this quarter and the traffic trend this quarter, the strength in everything in all throughout the year when we get to 2019, and you're up against that comparison in 2Q. Because I just want to say in 2Q of next year, there is going to be a lot of skepticism that you can comp the comp at that point in time? So just your thoughts.",,0.909
TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,119,Answer,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So let me start with the macro environment. And we've talked about this a lot over the last few years, and there has been a lot of questions about the role of stores would play. And was everything going to shift online. And I think the one voice that was missing from that conversation was the voice of the consumer. And consumers continue to vote with their footsteps. And as we sit here today and the numbers tend to vary from week-to-week, but on any given day, 90% of retail sales were done in physical stores. And I think what you're seeing right now from a macro basis, is well-run retailers with strong balance sheets that generate cash that they can invest back into their business are winning right now. And there are, obviously, others right now that can't afford to invest in their store experience or build capabilities or drive differentiation. And they're giving us share. So there are clearly winners and losers. We certainly think we're migrating to the winners' column. And we're driving not only traffic, but as Mark and Cathy and John have talked about, we're taking market share in all of our major merchandising categories. And the investments we're making to make sure the target is a long-term winner are being rewarded right now by the consumer and our guest. So we've got to continue to make sure we focused on executing our strategies, we go into '19 continue to take advantage of the market share opportunities that are out there. And I'll go back to our February 2017 investor conference. And one of the things we've talked about in our overall management thesis if they're going to be billions of dollars of retail market share up progress, and we're going to position ourselves to take more than fair share of that. We're seeing it happen. As companies like Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us exit the market, as others close stores, we're picking up market share in those important categories in those key geographic attachments. And we'll expect to continue to do that in '19 and beyond. And as what gives us confidence that we're going to be able to last these strong numbers in 2018 with continued strength in '19 and beyond.",0.249693,0.998

TGT-2018-Q2-2018-08-22,124,Answer,2018-08-22,2,2018,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Joe. I think internally, you probably heard us talk about the store modernization, and it's really Ken and the store team have done a great job just stepping back and saying what is that we're trying to accomplish in the store. And certainly there is the work we have to do moving product out of the sales floor and checking people out and all the things that just happened because they have to have them in the store. And our goal there is to become more efficient. And to become more efficient not just for efficiency, let's say, but to provide the fuel, so that we can invest in more talent and better expertise on the sales floor, and in particular, in those areas where it matters the most. So, Beauty, Electronics with our visual merchandising in both Home and Apparel and then in Food, those are areas where we have gone out and actively hired for expertise. And that's where things like the wage investment are so critical. They've allowed us to differentiate in who and how we hire people. And so those team members finding ways to bring that expertise in and then keep them on the floor so that the Beauty team member is in beauty all the time. And they're able to help the guests, and they also keep track of what's going on in that part of the store relative to in-stocks and inventory flow.",0.5845272,0.992

And then we've invested in tools and a significant amount of training to help them. And this has been a journey we've been on for a couple of years.

Week-to-week results have been volatile since Christmas and overall traffic declined nearly 1% in the first quarter.

As we look ahead to the second quarter, we're committed to maintaining the cautious posture that service well in the first quarter.

At checkout, guests will have the option to choose to have their orders delivered to their home later that day in a scheduled delivery window of their choice. This test presents an opportunity to gauge guest demand for this service. In a high traffic location filled with urban guests who will appreciate the convenience.

As a result, we have to be very thoughtful about how we conduct the test, because we don't want to make changes that might impair day-to-day reliability. In the second quarter, we plan to open a new facility in the North East that will allow us to test differentiated distribution capabilities, including store replenishment based on the appropriate unit of measure on every item, including palettes, key specs and niches.

I want to stress that we're opening this facility so we can test and learn quickly, not to create new capacity. In fact, given our opportunity to continue increasing the speed and flexibility of our entire supply chain and leverage our stores to enable digital fulfillment, we have ample capacity within our current network to grow for many years.

This store has much lower volume than our stores in the North East, which provided us some much lower risk environment for this early test.

And that's just some early bumps we've done so without affecting out stocks. With these insights, we are ready to move onto the next stage of testing with the new facility, and the team is eager to begin evaluating the results.

For the pilot, guests will have access to more than 8,000 items and will continue to experiment expand the offering based on our learnings and guest feedback. Because the items we package and deliver from a nearby store, orders placed before 1:30 pm will be delivered on the following business day.

That's why we're moving quickly to elevate both the digital and in-store shopping experience, driving guest engagement and sales in every channel. For digital shopping, the challenge is to make it more experiential, delivering more of the inspiration you can find in a physical store. To elevate the digital experience in furniture and décor, which are already large and growing online businesses for us, we recently rolled out 360 degree shoppable living room, which serve as a digital showroom. Seeing the products staged in rooms in relation to other products helps guests to better understand the size and style of an item making it easier to shop.

This growth was partially driven by approximately 600 shipped from store locations and we've added since last year. However, the increase was also driven by additional volume running through stores that had this capability for more than a year.

And importantly, the ability to ship directly from stores to nearby guests reduces our last mile shipping cost dramatically.

Most encouraging for the 10 fold remodels in which the layout is more similar to the new layout we will roll out in Houston later this year, we have seen lifts near the high-end of that range.

Consistent with our plan for the year, we began ramping up store labor on the sales floor. But in the first quarter, those investments in front-end labor were offset by savings in backroom logistics. In addition, we saw some timing favorability on several expense lines in the first quarter, which we now expect to see in the second quarter.",0.3245446,0.612

Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Our first quarter depreciation and amortization rate was up about 20 basis points compared with last year, reflecting increased costs from our remodel program on a lower base of sale. Altogether, our EBIT rate was 7.4% in the quarter, down from a very strong 8.2% last quarter. At the end of the quarter, inventory was more than 5% lower than a year ago, reflecting the early impact of our work to increase the speed of our supply chain. As I've mentioned before, we believe we have a compelling opportunity to free up working capital overtime by increasing the speed and accuracy of our supply chain.

We earned an after tax ROIC of 14.2% in the 12 months through the end of the first quarter. I hope you'd agree that is healthy performance in any industry and any environment, but it's also slightly better than Target's ROIC through the first quarter of last year, excluding the one-time gain from our sale of our pharmacy business. I think that's helpful perspective as we move through a year of meaningful transformation. We are blessed to have a business that continues to generate good returns and have a strong balance sheet.

We are planning for a low-single digit decline in comparable sales in the second quarter. Just like the decision we face in the first quarter, we could plan for a more optimistic scenario but that would create undue risk in a very choppy environment. On the EBIT line, we are planning for a decline of just over $200 million compared with last year.

For the full year, we are not updating our prior guidance. As a reminder, that guidance anticipates a low-single digit decline in comparable sales for the year and adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20. Clearly, given that first quarter performance exceeded our expectations, there is a higher chance that we'll finish the year in the upper end of that range.

Again, we're early days of a long journey. But you are seeing some of that offset. So it doesn't show up as apparently on the SG&A.

And then Mark can amplify as well. So on the impact that we saw coming through gross margin, as Mark shared and we've shared actually for a couple of quarters. Our biggest work has got to be around making sure that the value we're delivering is really clear. And it's going to take a while for our guests to give us a credit for that. And so that's the work that we're going to continuing to do. So while we're sharpening and making it more regionalized, you'll see that come through slightly. But the bigger effort is all of the work we're doing, and like the Target Run and Done campaign that we launched this last quarter and making sure that our guests recognize the value we are delivering.",0.0637584,0.977

So we're doing this area-by-area, classification-by-classification as an involving transfer. And we've really begun those efforts through Q1 but more in the backend as we match to the Target Run and Done campaign. So what we're seeing here is that on the handle side, we've been, clearly we've had up to 28 different handles that we've been using to resonate value across all our classification.

I think the biggest learning is as we move into these new neighborhoods, consumers love Target and they love the brand. And the response we're seeing has been really outstanding. So we feel very good about our small format strategy as we move into new neighborhoods; we're getting better and better are curating and localizing assortment; understanding how to operate in various markets; and we're also encouraged to see the early top results as we lap some of the new small formats we opened up last year.

We know we've got a lot of work to do. But I think it's important as we aim to recognize, as a Company, we have a very strong foundation.

So you've heard me say many times we're putting our stores at the center of our strategy. In the last three years, we've spent more than $4 billion remodeling our stores, completing hundreds each year, transforming them to showrooms, fulfillment hubs and service centers.

And just like our remodel program, we're fine tuning our approach with each project. Like any new neighborhood, you have to really live in it to figure out the daily rhythms and routines. In Tribeca, for example, we knew there would be a steady stream of office workers over the lunch hour and tourist on weekends, but we didn't realize just how much room we'd need to accommodate all the double jogger strollers in our aisles.

Starbucks is a pretty great place to hang out. Kevin will tell you, you have to design your experience to fit either occasion. At Target, we see the world exactly the same way.

But before I get to the model, I want to share a little bit about my experience here at Target and how it's informed my perspective on our business. As Brian mentioned earlier, I began my career in finance and that's always been my passion.

But that perspective is to narrow. We should always ask if we can replace the word ""or"" with the word ""and"". If we can do that successfully, we will generate superior performance today and over time. Put another way, we should always focus first on the long term but deliver it through strong execution one quarter at a time.",,0.832

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When I think about the long-term trajectory of our business, the one thing that's clear is the need to focus first on strong top line growth. When a retailer is growing, there are so many more levers to pull, more ways to build a model from the top line to the bottom line that makes long-term financial sense. The benefits of growth go well beyond the straightforward reasons like fixed cost leverage.",,0.962
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,108,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Growth makes Target a more attractive partner for our vendors, which helps us control costs and attract new partners.

But, as we plan for the future, we have to be careful not to take our primary focus away from relevance in growth. We've all seen it. Companies who focus too much on rate and then realize only too late that growth is slowing, traffic is stagnating and customer loyalty is beginning to evaporate.

If we work to learn more and more about them and find ways to deepen our relationship with them, they'll reward us with more trips and more sales.

It took patience and dollars, and we took the time to develop a strategy that makes sense for Target given our assets, our assortment and our brand. And now, as you've seen over the last several years, with the right strategy and renewed growth, we've built a business model that's delivering strong top line and bottom-line performance.",,0.859
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,115,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Once we committed to investing in digital, new fulfillment possibilities emerged and we proved something that wasn't obvious five years ago. It turns out that digital isn't just about delivering cardboard boxes to your house. It's really about ease, convenience and reliability. Sometimes that can mean a box on your front porch, but more and more guests are telling us that our same-day services are the new model of convenience.",,0.348

TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,118,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, for instance, when guests find out about our same-day services, we see a meaningful change in the mix of their shopping as they begin choosing same-day services as a replacement for other options. However, as John mentioned earlier, that's only part of the story. We also see incremental growth in spending from guests who begin using our same-day services, which benefits all categories and channels.",,0.758
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,119,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Take for instance the change in behavior among guests who use drive up for the first time. Following that first drive-up trip, we see their overall spending go up by nearly 25%. This increase is the result of higher digital spending which grows by nearly 50% as guests begin using drive up and also spend more on order pick up, ship to home and Shipt. However, this increased digital engagement doesn't come with the expense of store sales which also increased by 9%. The causation is clear. This new service drives engagement which in turn leads to higher sales in all channels.",,0.928
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,120,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I witnessed the impact of drive up on my own family's behavior. With three kids between the ages of 6 and 13, my wife and I sometimes feel like Uber drivers as we shuttle our kids between different sports and activities. So drive up is the perfect solution. When we realized we need something, like post game snacks or replacement water bottle, we don't need to wait. We place the drive-up order and it's ready in less than an hour. The next time we're passing the store, and I can assure you that happens multiple times in a typical Saturday, we drive up and the order is in our car in less than two minutes.",,0.931
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,121,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C.

This is the essence of our digital journey. By designing solutions focused on our guests and investing in capabilities that makes sense for our business, we reestablished Target's credibility in delivering convenience which drove growth across our business. With that growth, our team was able to develop capabilities and a business model that also makes financial sense.",,0.818
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,122,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When we move down the P&L to consider our long-term operating margin rate, we think it's optimal to plan for only a small amount of leverage over time driven by the D&A line. Otherwise, we are planning for generally small and offsetting changes in our gross margin and SG&A expense rates. This expectation is first informed by our bottom-up analysis of the drivers of both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates and an expectation that we can generally balance the headwinds and tailwinds over time.",,-0.572

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the gross margin line, we expect to continue to benefit from the ongoing efforts of our merchant teams to optimize performance within categories, including assortment, cost, pricing and promotions. These efforts were a meaningful driver of favorability in 2019 and we expect they will continue to contribute to our gross margins in 2020 and beyond.",,0.318
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,129,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"A second and important factor in our gross margin performance is the mix of our sales. In 2019, with unusually strong growth in our apparel category, sales mix was a meaningful driver of our overall gross margin rate. As we look ahead, we believe it's prudent to plan for our margin mix to be neutral to slightly favorable with periodic opportunities for outperformance, like we saw in 2019.",,0.883
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,130,,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And finally, growth in digital fulfillment will continue to put cost pressure on our gross margins. The reason for this expectation is simple. Digital fulfillment involves incremental costs compared with the traditional store transaction. While our same-day services are much less costly than traditional digital fulfillment, and we continue to increase efficiency within each of those is fulfillment modes, we expect those benefits will serve as mitigating factors rather than driving in overall rate benefit.",,0.765

And while there are hundreds of separate expense lines that can affect SG&A in a given quarter or year, there are two factors that will be most important over time. The first is the cost of labor, including both pay and benefits. We expect that growth in these expenses will continue to be a headwind in the years ahead for a couple of important reasons.",,0.888

However, based on our revised outlook for the timing of certain expenditures, we have an updated view of the cadence by year.

First, a bit of retrospective on the fourth quarter. How much do you think there were some industry factors that went on there, like you know in electronics and toys versus the six fewer days and versus what may be left on the table in non-gaming and electronics and home? And then related to that, as you get into the fourth quarter next year, I know it's far out, but you do have two extra days. You have a new PlayStation and Xbox launching. So are you more optimistic on the potential top line outlook for the fourth quarter next year? And then of course related to that, there's probably a gross margin headwind there given the mix probably turns upside down relative to what you saw this year.",,0.751
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,182,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Chris, good morning. Thanks for joining us and I want to thank everyone for being so flexible today. We look forward to seeing you in person throughout the year and certainly we look forward to gathering again in person next year. Chris, as I think about Q4 and we've talked about some of the implications, obviously, we felt really good about our performance in many categories. Very strong growth in apparel, strength in beauty, in household essentials and also in food and beverage, which was offset by softness in toys where we ran a flat comp but actually grew share in a category that was facing some pressure overall, and we were disappointed with our performance in electronics. That being the case, we're feeling very confident that we're already putting plans in place for the fourth quarter of this year. We'll learn from last year. We'll make sure that we enhance our inventory position on key items. As we've said many times, we exited the fourth quarter of this year and when into January with very little clearance inventory. We're going to make sure that we rebalance inventories as we going into next year. We're excited about some of the newness in electronics, some changes we'll make in our home cadence. But overall, we're already working on our plans for the fourth quarter of 2020 and feel very confident that we'll certainly learn from this year and build some exciting plans for our guests as we think about the holiday season of 2020.",0.990176,0.99

And then for a long-term perspective, the third party assortment that you have online, you called that 250,000 SKUs. Is that inclusive of your SKUs online or is that incremental? How large do you see this potentially going? And then on the fulfillment front, is this a drop-ship arrangement from the vendor or are you stocking these items now?

TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,197,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Hi, Oliver. On drive up, I think the big changes you're going to see this year we talked about, we want to add fresh or temperature-controlled products that is the number request from our guests to add a little bit of selective portion of our assortment there so they can round out their drive-up trip. You'll also see us add adult beverage. That is also a request directly from our guests as we continue to get feedback on that. I would say directly on the automation, we may be going in a little bit different direction than some others. I think we think the store experience is based on interactions with our team member and we think the differentiation much like we see with Shipt is the opportunity to provide that human connection between our team and the guests. From our perspective, the value of the automation today is upstream. And so we look to take work out of the store, consolidate it upstream and then working with our distribution teams automate some of that to make it more efficient. And the goal there is to free our team's up in-store to interact with our guests and again provide that human connection, and that includes as it relates to drive up. And so that's the direction we've gone, as you know, for many years and we'll continue to work against that.",0.9447401,0.954

On the promotion front, I think you'll see us continue to make sure we've got that right balance of great promotion and strong everyday price. And there's certain times of the year when we lean in more into promotion appropriately, but I think you'll see us consistent in trying to balance both of those promotion and everyday price in the right way. I also might add, that's why I get excited about a program like Circle. That gives us a great foundation to even personalize to a greater degree of fidelity the right promotion to the right guest. And so the launch of Circle in October gives us another arrow in our quiver when it comes to getting the right promotions in front of guests.",0.8583709,0.972

TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,204,Question,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. John Mulligan, in your comments, you had said that this is the first year I guess 2020 where the supply chain investments were all going to come together. And I just wondered in the gross margin guidance that you gave was very helpful. How should we expect that supply chain investment to drive potentially better gross margin results longer term?",1.0323373,0.68
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,205,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, Kate. Good to talk to you this morning. First, I'd say there is a sequencing thing here, right. We continue to see IPC scale, our inventory planning control, where we put the inventory. As we said, we'll scale automation; the - each year's automation to about a quarter of the stores this year. And then late this year we'll start to bring the Perth Amboy automation together with that to get the totality of what we've been building over several years together. Our focus, like I said, has been to consolidate that work, pull it out of the stores and then use automation to improve how we do it upstream. So I think the biggest impact you'll see from a gross margin perspective relates more to continuing to reduce out of stocks, to get our - one, improve the guest experience; but two, capture those sales and improve gross margin dollars. So I think that's by far the largest improvement. The other place where we continue to have opportunity is exactly what Brian just said. As we continue to grow same-day fulfillment, that has a positive impact or it lessens the negative impact, if you will, of continuing to grow our digital business.",1.0896439,0.896
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,206,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Kate, I'd just reinforce a couple of points that John's made. As we think about the benefits upstream automation, we'll continue to focus on improving our in-stock positions, the quality of our in-store presentation, continue to invest in that high touch service and continue to support our same-day fulfillment options. So you'll continue to hear us repeat that again and again as we think about 2020 and beyond. But we think we've got opportunities to improve our in-stock position, improve the quality of our presentation each and every day, continuing to make sure that we use our team members and that human touch as a point of differentiation, and continue to invest in our same-day fulfillment options.",0.8894801,0.95

Is that something that we can expect across the whole store in 2020 or is it a longer term?",1.1289398,0.735
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,208,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Kate, obviously as we continue to invest in growth both in-store and online, we're seeing a number of new vendors knocking on our door. Certainly we've seen that in categories like apparel with Levi's and what we've done in the space with Disney, but we're also seeing new brands knocking on our door in categories like beauty. We were really excited this week to announce the new partnership with Boar's Head in food and beverage. So I would expect that's going to continue to happen over time and we'll carefully select those new partners that fit our brand standards and are right for our guests.",0.8902988,0.966

TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,211,Question,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. The first question is on the coronavirus. Are you seeing any indications today from your vendor partners that you're going to have supply disruptions in the coming months and are you altering any decisions or doing any continued contingency planning for an extended consumer disruption? For example, might you be even delaying share repurchases because it could impact your stock price in the coming weeks and months?",0.0548506,0.715
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,212,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Michael, like others, we've been carefully monitoring the situation and the impact on our business, our team and our guests. We've been working closely with our overseas vendor partners. Both our own brand partners and our national brand partners understand the state of play. We've set up a team over the last month that's literally meeting daily to monitor POs, to understand the state of production in China, to understand the rate of workers returning to work, understanding the state of the ports. So we've been looking at this from all possible dimensions. And certainly from a merchandizing standpoint, we know that we're going to see some periodic delays. We're out in front of that making changes in our assortment and our promotional and presentation plans, but all that's reflected right now in our view of guidance for certainly the first quarter and the balance of the year. We've also been working very closely with some of our domestic vendors, our DSD partners, as we see some growing demand in categories like household essentials and food and beverage to make sure we are supporting that with the right level of inventory. So it's an ongoing process and it's very dynamic, but I feel really good about the work our teams have done, the focus that our sourcing groups, our supply chain, our merchants have brought to this discussion, and our focus is going to be to continue to meet the needs of our guests during these challenging times that we're all facing.",0.2013917,0.978
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,213,Question,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"That's very helpful. My follow-up question is on the gross margins. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how the gross margin by line item performed in the fourth quarter and mostly from the merchandizing strategies and digital fulfillment piece? And then as part of that, on the digital fulfillment piece that had become less dilutive to the gross margin. Seems like based on the commentary, the headwind from that is going to pick up. Have you just reached an inflection point where you're doing as much as - a lot of digital fulfillment through your stores and as you do more, you don't see much of a marginal benefit from that as you move forward?",0.1056079,-0.17
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,214,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I'll start with some of the Q4 margin piece of that, Michael. The two things I would call out in Q4 that really helped us on the margin side, we were really proud of the profit performance we were able to deliver in Q4. And it came in part from some of the categories where we really saw strength. Apparel grew strong and gained share and that's always beneficial to the gross margin side, both the gross margin naturally in that business and then we ended the season really clean and that saves us clearance markdowns on the back end. The second callout is actually the second part of your question. The same-day service growth is healthy for our profit compared to shipping a box long distances. Those same-day services are way closer to the economics of an in-store sale and that's helpful on the bottom line too.",0.2304544,0.979

I wanted to ask, can you share a little more color on, like you talked about the electronics category redesigning it. Like what are you guys envisioning there for that department? And if you maybe tested it anywhere and if there's a significant cost to do that?",,0.889
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,219,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Joe, we're still in the early stages of testing some new redesigns. You should expect that to appear in about 200 locations this year. Start to envision TVs at a much lower level as you would actually see them in your home and emphasis on more interaction with our team members to provide insights into how to bring these products home and install them in your home, certainly elevating some of the focus on the key brands in that space. And we know that brands are really important in that space. So the focus we'll place behind brands like Apple and Samsung. So really trying to make sure as a more inviting environment where we can have better interaction with our guests where our teams can provide the professional services that our guests are looking for in that space. So we'll continue to test and learn and iterate as we've always done with changes in-store, but we really want to make sure that we bring the guests a much more inspiring environment within electronics where our team members can provide the expertise that they need each and every day.",0.1232092,0.93
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,220,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The only thing I'd add, Joe, on the cost side, if you think about doing this in the context of a store remodel where we tear up a fair bit of the store through the course of that remodel, the marginal capital here is relatively modest and certainly far better than doing it on its own and going into the store and just doing this as part of the store. So as Brian said, we'll bring it into the remodel program. The early testing certainly shows that there is a payback to doing so, and so we feel good about that. And as Brian said, we'll get a few more stores and a couple of hundred stores and really have a good idea of what it brings.",0.4645927,0.936

If I could follow up with the own brands or private brands, you guys obviously have done a great job, brought in some or developed so many new ones. How should we think about it going forward? Like will you continue to bring newness and replace some of the brands that you've even launched maybe two, three years ago or will there be all additive or how are you envisioning that for the next couple of years?",,0.885
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,222,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Joe, I think you're going to see us spend a lot more time on brand management, and I'll use Cat & Jack as an example. Cat & Jack has been part of our collection for four years now. It's now a multibillion dollar brand. But our teams will need to continue to bring newness, make sure that that brand is on trend, make sure that we continue to bring our refresh assortment to our guests each and every quarter and understand when we need to make changes and pivot some of these brands to make sure that we constantly stay on trend. So over the course of time, some of the brands we have introduced, they might go away and be replaced by some new brands, but I think more and more we're going to be making sure we're managing the lifecycle of those brands, bringing newness, bringing great insights, refreshing the collection, making sure the aesthetic is on trend for what our guest is looking for and continue to strengthen and invest in the brands that we have in place today. So Cat & Jack is just one of many of examples where we know we've got additional opportunities to build even stronger relationship with our guests and make sure those brands are even more relevant in years to come.",0.274253,0.98

First one, just on the mix of digital fulfillment, I think for last year it was 24% or so was the same-day stuff. Can you give us a flavor for how - or sense for how the remaining 76% breaks down between a traditional kind of fulfillment center going to someone's home and then how much of that is kind of the stores delivering to the home but not obviously on a same-day basis? That's my first question.",,0.238
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,227,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Like we said, Peter, the aggregate for Q4 and where we're running right now is about 80% of the fulfillment we do is done by the stores. If you take away the same-day portion, all of the rest of that is shipped from store. The remainder of that is our FCs, which is probably depending on the day in the 12% to 15% range and then direct vendor ship is very, very small. We prefer that because the service there isn't typically at our standards. But I think overall you'll continue to see us operate in that 80% range. And as the same-day fulfillment grows, the ship from store will come down a little bit or not grow as fast really. It will continue to grow, just not grow as fast. But the stores overall continue in that - we think that 80% range is right where we want to be.",0.4437167,0.625

And then just on the inventory position, how you're feeling about it heading into the spring here? And obviously it sounds like February is off to a good start here, but curious about kind of the early indications around seasonal demand, whether it be in the southern markets or whatnot? How is that setting in and where you are from an inventory perspective? And then as we think just down the road to back to school, were you thinking any of the sourcing for back to school product, I'm not sure how much of that would be even coming out of China, but just how are you thinking about some of your back to school plans here in terms of getting the product here?

Peter, we'll start with the first big season of the year and that was Valentine's Day in February where we saw very strong performance and a great reaction from the guests. We expect that to continue as we go into Easter. And obviously we're very focused on back to school, back to college which is a very important season and life moment for Target. And I think we feel very good about our sourcing plans and our position as we get ready for that holiday season. So off to a good start. We've seen a very good reaction to our assortment and our plans for Valentine's Day. We're now focused on the Easter holiday.

First of all, just on the quarter-to-date sales, I guess - I'm wondering - I think your comments on coronavirus were much more limited to the supply chain as opposed to top line, but any color you could give in terms of whether there has been some positive benefit from stockpiling I guess in the quarter-to-date trends?",0.4604994,0.892

But over the last few days as obviously everyone's been reporting, we've certainly seen a U.S. consumer that's starting to stock up on household essentials, disinfectants, food and beverage items, all those staple items that the CDC has recommended they add to their pantry. And certainly we've seen aggressive shopping across the country in our stores. So we're obviously working closely with our domestic vendors, with our DSD partners to make sure that we're elevating inventory in preparation for what we think is going to be a continued demand for stock up items. So certainly we're seeing that across our network. We expect that to continue over the next few weeks and we'll watch it carefully over time.",0.779779,0.886

And then just on inventory and I guess working capital in general, obviously we - it was advertised that you would have inventories down in 3Q given the year-over-year comparison, but I guess I'm wondering if you have any thoughts or color on whether you overly managed inventory in terms of losing out on some sales in the season? And then thoughts on working capital and inventory specifically into next year as it relates to out-of-stock?",0.1342612,-0.512

And I think as we look at the fourth quarter, we clearly recognize that we exited the fourth quarter at a level of inventory that was actually too clean and certainly lost some sales as a byproduct of that. There were many key items where we didn't buy deep enough. We ran out before the holiday season. We have very little clearance inventory in January. And while that was a benefit to our gross margin during the period, we certainly lost some sales because of that and our teams are actively engaged in making sure that we learn from that as we plan for the holiday of 2020.",0.7891936,0.945

As I said in my remarks, we've kind of been tracking toward a dividend payout ratio of 40%. As we get to that mark, you could expect us to increase dividends at a more aggressive pace going forward. Something in the mid single-digit range for this year in total is probably about right.

I was wondering if we could get maybe a little more detail on the move into fresh, frozen and alcohol and the early responses that you've seen in the Twin Cities test and maybe kind of walk us through what the barriers are to rolling that out quickly or sooner rather than later and what the profit impacts are on drive up when you start including things like fresh and frozen? Thanks.",0.6815966,0.93
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,243,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Hi, Robbie. Professor is probably a strong word to describe me. I think we've been testing this in the Twin Cities with key members for a few months now, several months. I think, like I said, the guests feedback broadly is that they want to add a few more items to their drive-up basket, something like milk, eggs, whatever, bread, whatever the kind of staples are that they need or bananas. And so we feel good that that will be - this is ultimately be adding a few more items to what is already a drive-up order. And from that perspective we think ultimately will get to a good place on the economics. Clearly, we have work to do to scale the business, to work through the operations for the stores. We want to ensure that we have the chill chain wired and all of that, and I think that's where you'll see us make sure we can do it at scale. We've done the operating test with our team members, so we understand how it should work. But then we want to get to a place where as that demand grows as we introduce it, which we've seen with every one of the things we've introduced from a fulfillment capability perspective, the demand grows relatively rapidly and we want to be sure we're built for it. The final piece that perhaps changes the cadence a little bit is we do need to go back in and ensure we have capacity in the store to handle the temperature controlled. The one thing we will not trade on is the speed and efficiency with which drive up occurs today. A two to three minute promise is incredibly important. We think it's a - we know it's a differentiator in the marketplace. And so ensuring that we have frozen and refrigerated capacity close to the front of the store so that our team members can continue to deliver on that pace requires some build out. And so you'll see us work through that as well. Put all that together, us wanting to learn, some build-out time and that's why we get to the scaling that we're talking about for this year.",0.286533,0.989

Our overall expectations for the level of continued investment in the business are actually about the same. I think what you're seeing are some puts and takes by year as we've refined our expectation on the specific timing of certain projects. For example, the timing of when we bring a distribution center online can move around a year versus what we thought before and we're continually revising those out year plans. Maybe about 0.5 billion light of where we thought we'd be in 2019. 2020 is unchanged at 3.5 billion. 2021's a little higher based on the re-timing of some of those projects, but 3 billion to 3.5 billion.

And then just a quick follow up on what you're seeing currently on coronavirus and demand. As it relates to digital fulfillment, any increased demand that you're seeing there, thoughts on how that might impact digital growth next year - during 2020, sorry? And are you making any adjustments on fulfillment capacity at all related to this?",0.3338361,0.607
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,251,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Ed, actually as we sit here today I think we're reminded just how important stores are to our guests during a time like this. And we've certainly seen a surge in store traffic as guests begin to stock up on those household essentials and those core food and beverage items. So it's been a reminder to all of us that stores are critically important to our guests. It's where the majority of U.S. shopping still takes place. And while our same-day fulfillment options are growing in popularity, our guests still respond to our stores first and foremost. So that's really what we've seen recently and I think you're seeing that across the retail sector, but it is a reminder that our multi-category portfolio is very important during times like this and our stores play a really important role to meet the needs of today's guests during uncertain times.",0.3970528,0.925

Maybe if you can throw out one positive and one negative thing that really surprised you in 2019? And I'm also curious what you view as the lowest-hanging fruit for 2020 as well as how you're thinking about your biggest challenge in 2020? Thanks.",0.5120753,0.925
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,255,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'll start, but I think this is a great question to open up for both John and Michael. If I think about positive surprises for 2019, I think the overall consistent performance that we delivered from a top line standpoint, the exceptional growth we delivered, the market share gains we saw across so many categories and we illustrated that during our presentation today, but seeing the type of share gains that we delivered in apparel, in beauty, the continued strength in toys, the strength we saw in household essentials and food and beverage, our multi-category portfolio performed so well throughout the year. Obviously we were very pleased with our ability to translate that into operating income growth and obviously into expanded EPS improvement. So for me, the health of the entire portfolio, the fact that our entire multi-category portfolio performed so well and we were able to take oversize share in so many categories translate that back to operating income and EPS growth for our shareholders, I think the quality of the results in 2019 is something we feel very good about. If I think about an opportunity, we've talked about it many times, we were disappointed with our performance in the fourth quarter in several spaces and we think we've got opportunities to go back into 2020 and improve performance in toys, in electronics and parts of our home business. As we focus on key items next year, we want to make sure we're buying to the depth required to make sure that we meet the demand in the marketplace during the holiday season. So those are important lessons learned. But the combination of our straight in our portfolio, the growth we saw in same-day fulfillment options, think about the fact that order online, pick up in store has been something we've been offering for five to six years now. The fact that during the fourth quarter we saw growth rates of close to 50%, the expansion in the way the guest has reacted to the drive-up component, we feel really good about those highlights and obviously we're always a company that's self critical. There's things we know we can do better and we will as we plan for 2020. John, what's on your list?",0.3065903,0.999
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,256,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, you had a good list there. I think from my perspective the two things I'd say from an operations perspective, one, Brian hit right on it, the way same-day - really the guests' acceptance there and the guests' preference there for same day, we certainly planned for that to grow meaningfully this year. That exceeded our expectations. And so I think that is something we will continue, as we said, build out next year, improve drive up, add different categories to drive up I think is a huge opportunity for us. And then continuing to grow Shipt both inside Target and outside Target we think is an opportunity. The other highlight I would say that we haven't talked a lot about today, but the work of the stores' teams and delivering the great store experience they did while we changed entirely their operating model, and I said earlier 300,000 team members basically all getting new job descriptions across the company and the way they handled that change, the great job the leaders did to lead through that, and as I said while continuing to provide a great in-store experience; one, it's a highlight for me for 2019 but it is a huge opportunity for 2020 and beyond because we're just getting started there, right? Everyone's learned their jobs and now we have the opportunity to really improve that operating model, improve how we work with our guests and serve their needs in the store and I think that's a great, great opportunity for us in 2020. Michael?",0.1543185,0.997
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,257,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You guys have covered a lot of ground. I'll try to add to it. In 2019, if you step back and look at that year compared to our long-term algorithm, low single-digit comp growth, mid single-digit operating income, high single-digit EPS growth, it was a year that exceeded that algorithm meaningfully. And our ability to translate top line strength into bottom-line profit is a real standout for me. And then the capper is to see ROIC at 16%. Back to the investment question and CapEx question earlier, we've got a balance sheet that we have built intentionally to afford ourselves the capacity to invest in growth and to see those investments payoff with strong ROIC performance is always good from the chair I sit in. In terms of opportunities, a little bit more inventory at the end of the year would have been nice. We've touched on that already. And as I think about 2020, I'd go back to the multi-category model both through the limbs of strengths and opportunities. I think we've really shown over time that model affords us the ability to lean in and be aggressive and take share across a number of categories when the opportunity presents itself. And when I think about risks, it's the stuff that we can't see coming as we sit here today that's probably going to be what we're going to talking about as the year progresses. But the benefit of a multi-category model is it buys us a lot of diversification of that risks and our ability to flex within that model to overcome whatever is thrown at us is really strong.",0.238641,0.991
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,258,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Paul, I'll come back to kind of two other highlights as we think about the year and I think about even the fourth quarter. While we were disappointed with our comp sales in the fourth quarter only growing by 1.5%, we were able to take market share across many categories. But importantly, because of the work that we've done in-store, the disciplined approach we've taken in our supply chain, our ability to manage category mix and the fact that on a comp growth of 1.5%, we grew operating income by 7.3%, EPS up over 10% is something that I think our team is very proud of. And I would end by going back to the team. And for several years now, I think our team has demonstrated that we have built a sustainable, durable financial model that - one that's going to perform continuously over time. And I feel terrific about the talent we have at Target, the diversity of our team, the leadership that we have in place right now. And obviously at the end of the day it always comes down to people. And this is a fabulous team that I think is prepared to face any of the challenges in front of us, but puts the guests first is thinking about what's right for our business, right for our shareholders and I think that's one of the things that we all feel really good about as we go into 2020.",0.2431437,0.935

One was you mentioned inventory a lot and I guess I want to ask a little bit - it sounds like you really wish you had more. And I'm wondering what things can you do to change the incentive structure for the organization or at least shift to have that extra 500 million of inventory? Because it just seems to make sense given your traffic growth and the interest rate environment that we're in?",0.7060354,0.934
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,265,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Greg, I'll start. And as I think about where we ended up and the choices we made, it's not about changing our incentive structure. Our incentive structure is really well connected to the overall financial objectives of this company. Next year and actually throughout the year, you're going to see us focus on fewer items in a much bolder way to make sure we're delivering a great experience for our guests, but you'll see us curate even tighter as we go into 2020, make sure that we stand behind those key items that we know are on trend that are going to drive demand, that are going to delight our guests and bring them job when they're shopping our stores or shopping online. So it's not about changing an incentive structure. It's about saying, all right, here's items we're going to stand for, we're going to make sure we're bold and deep as we make those buys and we're going to make sure that they're the right items that deliver upon our brand promise and make sure that we're delivering both a great experience and great quality and style and terrific value throughout the year.",0.0483013,0.995

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The only thing I'd add, Greg, I don't think this was our merchant teams, our planning teams, IM team - inventory management teams lacking conviction. I think we finished the year before a little bit heavy. The team's looked at a calendar with six less days of sales in front of them and perhaps took a - well, we did take a conservative approach and we perhaps went a little bit further. And I think like Brian said, we recognized where we have some opportunity and already adjustments are in place, so we feel about that resolving itself.",0.2218584,0.84
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,267,Question,2020-03-03,4,2019,Gregory Melich,MoffettNathanson,"And then secondly, of course we see the leveraging was you said, John, down 25% on total cost [indiscernible]. I'm curious what the growth of fresh and adult beverages would do this year? Should we expect a similar improvement? Will that create some headwinds? Because ultimately, if digital is profitable, it sounds like it is now but not as much as before [indiscernible] along those lines if you could help us would be great?",1.6641519,0.897
TGT-2019-Q4-2020-03-03,268,Answer,2020-03-03,4,2019,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I think Michael described it well in his remarks. Digital is always going to be dilutive to rate. But from our perspective, digital is really important because as we talked about particularly with those same-day sales, we see a lot of incrementality. We see 25% incrementality when someone brings drive up into how they engage with Target. We see 100% of their Shipt sales being incremental. So these are individuals becoming more engaged with Target. And with respect to drive up, as we give them the opportunity to buy a larger assortment, again what we hear from our guests consistently is, I want to do what I want to do, but hey by the way I can throw one or two more things into that basket. And so from that perspective, we feel good about getting to a good economic place with those transactions. And so there's much for us to learn here as we - we aren't even really doing this for guests yet in Minneapolis or we may have just started in the past week or week and a half, so there's a lot for us to learn there. But we feel really good and we feel really good especially given that consumers clearly are moving very quickly to same day and those economics are very beneficial to us.

When you pull back and consider what's happened in our business this year, it's clear that a couple of defining themes have emerged. The first is flexibility. You've seen that play out in our merchandising assortment, enabling us to satisfy our guests' rapidly chasing wants and needs throughout the year. You've also seen it play out in our operations as our stores as hubs model allowed our team to pivot seamlessly when guests move their shopping between stores and our digital channels. This flexibility will continue to serve us well in the fourth quarter and beyond, given that we continue to face an elevated level of uncertainty across multiple aspects of our business.",0.2885796,0.941

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our same-day services to deliver speed and convenience for our guests while driving an impressive amount of the Company's growth. In the third quarter, our same-day services grew well over 200% compared with last year, adding more than $1 billion of incremental sales. Nearly $700 million of this growth was from our Drive Up service alone, which increased more than 500% compared with last year. Amazingly, this growth was not at the expense of in-store pickup, which increased more than 50%.",0.1461318,0.925
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,39,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C.

For perspective, $2 billion is more than our company's total digital sales for the entire year in 2014. Somehow, I think I should pause for a second and let that sink in. But instead, maybe I'll pile on by making the same point a different way and point out that between the first three quarters of 2014 and the same period this year, the compound annual growth rate of our digital sales was 45% over that 6-year period.",0.1199345,0.382
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,41,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Another area in which we've seen amazing flexibility is in the management of our inventory as we've adapted to huge swings in the pace of sales among individual categories and work to support overall growth that's been well above the expectation. As I mentioned last quarter, while we continue to make progress, we've seen some persistent inventory shortfalls for a couple of distinct reasons. First, in several of our long lead categories, like electronics, home and apparel, our team has been playing catch up given that we experienced an unexpected sharp and sustained explosion demand for these categories.",0.271797,0.961
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,42,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The team has done a great job of chasing and expediting inventory to support these categories, which enable the unusually strong comps that Brian outlined earlier. Even more encouraging, we ended the third quarter in a much better position than where we started, and we expect to see additional recovery in the fourth quarter. The other driver of inventory shortfalls in 2020 is related to industry dynamics as the producers of cleaning and paper products have been working to ramp up production in the face of a dramatically higher demand across all of U.S. retail.",0.1584118,0.956
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,43,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Happily, we're also making progress in these categories, but we're not yet back to pre-COVID levels as supply improved during the quarter, and we expect to make continued progress in the fourth quarter. Overall, our progress is reflected in the aggregate numbers. Specifically, we started the third quarter with inventory down about 3% compared with a year ago and ended more than 11% higher than a year ago, after a quarter in which our sales grew more than 20%. This is a remarkable progress and puts us in a much better position as we move into the fourth quarter.",0.4838314,0.982
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,44,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I also want to highlight the flexibility of our properties team. We just opened 18 new stores in October. For the year, our team successfully opened 30 new stores, of which 29 were small formats, making 2020 the biggest year of small format openings ever. In any year, setting records would be notable. But in a year in which COVID caused us to delay our new store construction, it's been amazing to watch how quickly our team was able to restart such a large number of projects and successfully bring them to completion in advance of the holiday season.",0.3430209,0.943
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,45,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond flexibility, another key theme this year is capacity as we consider the physical resources we'll need to support our business over time. As Brian mentioned, we've already grown our sales by more than $10 billion through the first three quarters of 2020. And again, for context, that $10 billion of incremental sales is more than our total sales growth between 2011 and 2019, an 8-year period. You might well have wondered whether compressing eight years of growth into less than a year was impossible. But clearly, the capacity was there.",0.3974621,0.92
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,46,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And while capacity is a function of replenishment as well as fulfillment, the question we hear most often is whether we'll continue to have enough capacity for our digital fulfillment. And in that regard, the primary factor is our strategic decision to place our stores as the center of fulfillment. By relying on the same asset to fulfill both our conventional and digital sales, the key to fulfillment capacity is the store asset itself and the speed with which we can move inventory through it. You might refer to that as our ability to increase turnover. But sometimes you'll hear engineers like Michael and me, refer to that metric as throughput, just to sound smart.",0.1084732,0.95
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,47,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As we said in the past, sales per foot is a useful proxy for throughput. So let's consider how that has progressed so far this year. As a baseline, for the full year in 2019, average sales per foot at Target are about $320. And so far this year, that metric has grown about 19% compared with last year. So just as a thought exercise, if you assumed we were going to grow our sales productivity at a same pace for the full year, we'd end 2020 at about $380 per foot. Now I need to pause to quickly reinforce. I'm using a hypothetical 19% number. I'm not providing guidance for the quarter. I'm just giving us something to anchor on.",0.0970119,0.681
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,48,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the critical question is after growing sales per foot from the lower end of the $300 range into the upper 300s, do we have any more capacity in our stores? The answer is certainly yes. Last year, in our second quarter call, I mentioned that our top quartile stores averaged well over $400 a foot back in 2018, and that number has grown to nearly $500 since then. If we can average nearly $500 a foot on nearly 500 of our most productive stores, I think it's clear we have capacity to grow the chain average well beyond where it is today. And that capacity would be there, even if we kept doing what we're doing today.",0.2218584,0.837
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,49,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But of course, we continue to find ways to improve throughput. And one of our newest options is to deploy sortation centers in markets where delivery density is high. To better assess this concept, we recently opened our first sortation center here in Minneapolis, which will allow our teams to test, learn and assess its ultimate potential before determining whether to roll out the concept further. The business case for our sortation center is straightforward by moving sorting and staging prospects out of the stores. It frees up backroom space, enabling additional throughput.",0.0364306,0.878
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,50,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Stores can simply focus on packing the orders, which are then transferred multiple times per day to the sortation center, where they can be sorted and staged at a larger scale, driving per unit efficiencies and potentially reducing the number of split shipments. In addition, we can reduce per unit shipping cost by deploying technology from Grand Junction, which helps us to allocate packages across different providers and applying recently acquired technology from Deliv to help us to optimize sortation and injection into those provider networks.",0.2034384,0.925
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,51,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But unit efficiencies are only part of the potential benefit. While these centers require some capital investment, they are designed to increase both throughput and capital efficiency of our existing network, which should reduce the need for us to invest capital in upstream fulfillment centers. Net-net, our expectation is that investing in sortation centers will be a more capital-efficient way to add capacity, and we'll be assessing that potential through the test.",0.1809251,0.856
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,52,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Before I move on from this topic, I should quickly acknowledge, there are a number of other important considerations regarding capacity. Beyond overall capacity, within each store, we need to ensure we have allocated appropriate space to fulfill both our conventional store sales and our entire suite of store fulfilled digital sales. There are a number of ways we account for this in our plan.",0.2877609,0.866
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,53,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"First, we continue to find ways to optimize space within our stores, including options to free up front and space to accommodate growth and Pick Up and Drive Up and backroom space to accommodate peak demand for our ship-from-store capability. We're planning for this expanded capacity in our new stores and remodels, and we developed robust processes across the rest of the chain to free up space outside of a full remodel. Second, within each market, we route the bulk of our ship-from-store orders to lower volume stores, allowing the highest volume stores to devote most of their capacity to conventional sales.",0.2738436,0.926
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,54,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And third, we've developed tools and processes to create temporary peak capacity in both the frontend and the back room, which allows us to handle the fourth quarter surge both same-day and ship-from-store volume without building a permanent solution that we wouldn't need for the rest of the year. We've already deployed this additional temporary capacity across the chain in advance of this year's holiday peak, which we expect will be far larger than anything we've seen in the past.",0.0032747,0.429
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,55,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other consideration in planning for future capacity is our upstream supply chain, which handles the bulk of the product we receive from vendors and then relative to the stores across the country. Even going into this year, we told you that we would need to be adding to our upstream capacity to accommodate future volume. And with this year's unprecedented growth, upstream capacity has become an even more important aspect of our plan.",0.2812116,0.571
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,56,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, as I've said before, I hope these metrics and our demonstrated ability to grow well beyond expectations this year can help to address any of your concerns that we're going to run out of capacity. But in the meantime, I want to cover our plans for the fourth quarter peak. The team is in place and ready, and while stores will be busy, both our promotions and operational plans are designed to minimize crowding to allow our guests to shop safely.",0.1465411,0.942

And this year, our store central fulfillment model is well positioned to handle an unprecedented amount of digital volume. And while all of our digital options will likely see huge volume, we're really excited about our capacity to satisfy guest demand through our same-day services. We're ending the fourth quarter with double the number of C pace compared with a year ago. And as Brian mentioned, we've made technology changes to make it completely contactless.",0.1334425,0.836

On the expense line, this growth has resulted in an extraordinary amount of leverage, which has more than offset the pressure from additional costs. In addition, this year's unusually strong growth has resulted in exceptionally low markdown rate, as I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.",0.0429799,0.718

This is a hallmark of the durable model we've been building over the last few years. Our third quarter comparable sales increase of 20.7% reflects the continued pattern of trip consolidation by our guests as our average transaction size grew by more than 15% on top of very healthy traffic growth of 4.5%.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the gross margin line, we recorded a rate increase of about 80 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the net impact of three separate factors. The first is the benefit of our merchandising efforts, which contributed well over two percentage points to our gross margin rate in the quarter. While there are many individual factors within this larger bucket, the most notable is on the markdown line, as we saw exceptionally low promotional and clearance markdown rate.",0.3295129,-0.294

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the promotional markdown line, we've seen a year-over-year benefit since the pandemic began. And the reason is simple. When unit volume in commodity categories is so high that production is struggling to keep up with demand, it makes sense to stick with our low everyday prices and reduce the number of stock-up and other volume driving promotions, which would only increase the number of out-of-stocks faced by our guests.",0.4183381,0.128

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the clearance markdown line, we've seen even more favorability, and the reason is somewhat different. As demand for our non-commodity categories has stayed persistently higher than expected, we've sold a higher-than-average mix of our units at regular price with fewer than expected units sold on clearance discounts at the end of the season. Even more notable, favorability on the clearance line has been the primary driver of our overall markdown favorability on a year-to-date basis, despite the exceptionally high apparel markdowns we recorded in the first quarter.",0.48465,-0.061

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Offsetting the benefit of our merchandising efforts, there were two distinct headwinds to gross margin in the third quarter. The first was from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure, driven by rapid growth, digital fulfillment, along with incremental team member pay, benefits and safety costs for our supply chain team members. The other gross margin headwind came from category sales mix, which was worth about 60 basis points of pressure as lower-margin categories grew faster than higher-margin categories during the quarter.",0.6045845,0.226

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the SG&A expense line we recorded about 180 basis points of favorability in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the favorability on this line reflects exceptionally strong cost leverage due to sales growth of more than 20%. This benefit was so strong. It was able to offset about $300 million of incremental investments in team member pay and benefit, along with safety measures to protect our team and our guest.",0.4862874,0.963

Altogether, the business delivered an exceptionally high operating margin rate of 8.5%, more than three percentage points higher than last year.

In light of our higher profitability, income taxes grew by about $90 million compared with last year. On the bottom line, despite the loss on debt extinguishment, which was equivalent to $0.75 of pressure, third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations established a new record high of $2.01, representing an increase of 46% compared with $1.37 last year. Adjusted EPS, which excluded the debt extinguishment loss and a couple of other small factors in both years, also established a new record high of $2.79, more than 100% higher than $1.36 last year.",1.0397053,-0.902

Specifically, through the first two quarters of the year, our operations have delivered just over $7 billion of cash, which is nearly $3 billion more than a year ago. Obviously, our profit performance is an important factor in this increase, but we also continue to benefit from unusually high payables leverage, which is running well over 100%.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In light of the continued strength of our cash generation and resulting cash position on our balance sheet, our treasury team recently elected to take a couple of actions. The first was the execution of a debt tender offer in activewear, in which we invested $2.3 billion of cash to retire $1.8 billion of high coupon long-term debt. This transaction created significant economic value, and it will significantly reduce future interest costs. In addition, it allowed us to deploy the bulk of the extra cash we added in the first quarter when, like many other well-capitalized companies, we chose to take on additional liquidity insurance at a time of extreme uncertainty following the onset of the pandemic.",0.3348342,0.807

Beyond those actions, we also announced today that we have lifted the share repurchase suspension that we initially announced in the first quarter. We don't intend to engage in any repurchases before the end of the holiday season. But under appropriate conditions, we would look to reinitiate repurchases in 2021.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As always, the timing and quantity of repurchase activity will be governed by our decades-long capital deployment goals. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support our dividend and look to build on our nearly 50-year record of annual increases in our dividend per share. And finally, we deploy any excess cash beyond the first two uses to repurchase our shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.

We continue to expect full year CapEx in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, below our original expectation of about $3.5 billion, driven primarily by the reduction in remodel activity following the onset of COVID-19. We paid dividends of $340 million in the third quarter, reflecting a 3% increase in the dividend per share, partially offset by a decline in share count. And of course, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter in light of the suspension I mentioned earlier.",0.741711,0.848

Our business delivered an extraordinarily high 19.9% in the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, up nearly five percentage points from 15% a year ago. While our longer-term plans have focused on delivering higher after-tax ROIC over time, the acceleration over the last two quarters has been well beyond anything we would have expected. And given that our inventories have been consistently lower than we'd prefer, we gladly would have traded some cash for more inventory over the last two quarters even though that would have driven this metric somewhat lower.",0.6623005,0.402

While we stopped driving financial guidance back in the first quarter, I want to outline a number of important considerations as we move into the holiday season and the fourth quarter overall.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Offsetting this pressure, beginning with the onset of the pandemic, there has been a significant change in the mix of consumer spending as a meaningful portion has shifted away from travel in multiple forms of out-of-home entertainment and into many of the categories we sell. We also continue to benefit from trip consolidation as consumers have increasingly relied on our stores and digital services to satisfy a wide variety of their wants and needs in a single trip.",0.6954564,0.866

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Beyond these macro trends, there are a number of more specific considerations as we enter the holiday. The first is the expected change in the category mix of our fourth quarter business as typically both our Electronics and toy categories generate half their annual sales in the fourth quarter. Given that both of these categories have seen dramatically stronger sales since the pandemic began, it's more difficult than usual to predict how the pattern will play out in the fourth quarter.",0.4502661,0.638

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Similarly, the digital mix of our sales, an important factor in our overall profitability, typically reaches a seasonal peak in the fourth quarter. This year, it's difficult to predict how high our digital mix will become given that we've already seen dramatically higher levels of digital penetration all year. So the natural question is, once you quantify all the potential headwinds and tailwinds you've just outlined, what's your fourth quarter forecast?",0.6614818,0.523
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,83,Remarks,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think that's a great question. The reality is that none of us can accurately predict to the future as all of us are facing a much higher level of uncertainty compared with a normal year. That's the reason why we've suspended financial guidance, but that doesn't mean we can't affect the outcome. As I've mentioned before, we continue to prioritize flexibility as we plan our business and focus on agility in our operations. That way, when the unexpected happens, our team can respond quickly and effectively as you've seen so far this year.",0.2848956,0.807

Not only is it uncertain when the coronavirus will be fully behind us, it's also unclear how the consumer will behave in a post-COVID world. That creates uncertainty about the path of multiple categories as you consider how the mix of consumer spending will evolve and what the competitive landscape will look like. In adapting to that new world, we'll need to understand what that will mean for our business and how the financial metrics that have been dramatically changed this year will settle down over time.",0.522718,-0.077

So while specific metrics will continue to be difficult to predict, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our business and our ability to outperform. That's because based on the hard work of our team over the last few years, we now have a business model that's demonstrated its ability to deliver market share growth and profitability across a range of environments that's been far wider than any of us would have expected.",0.1694638,0.95

And as it pertains to the holiday, they're clearly telling us that they want to celebrate this holiday season, but they know it's going to be very different. Smaller gatherings, those trips that we used to take will be postponed, but we certainly expect that the guests that we serve is going to look for ways to find that a little bit of joy during the holiday season.

It's clear the level of fashion is on the rise at Target. There are plenty of well-known brands that sell into likes of Pennies and Kohl's and Macy's that now seem like a natural fit from Under Armour, Chaps, CK.

And you'll see us begin to accelerate a little bit next year, potentially 30 to 35, perhaps over time, get to 40 stores a year as we continue to think about opening those smaller stores to address trade areas where guests are seeking the Target experience, but today can't get that store experience. So like I said, we remain very bullish on that whole concept.",0.3577569,0.57

TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,118,Question,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I'm just wondering, with respect to a short-term question and then longer term, you gave a lot of color in terms of the things that you're doing near term and also for January, to the extent that January closed down. But I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about December from the perspective of there's been so much pull-forward of shopping. Do you think there's some risks from a December perspective that December kind of fizzles a little bit? And how are you planning for that? And then I just had one other bigger picture.",0.8104789,0.331
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,119,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Karen, why don't I start? I think as we've looked at the holiday season, we expected the guests to start shopping earlier, but continue to shop throughout the holiday season right up to Christmas Eve. So, we think it's going to be a prolonged shopping season. I think we're going to see very different shopping patterns. We don't expect to see those big spikes during Black Friday and all weekend. I think it's going to be spread across the holiday season. And we think December is going to be a very important gifting season for our guests.",0.3209169,0.891
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,120,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we're watching it carefully. And again, we'll put a premium on flexibility and agility as we work through the months of November and December. But all indications, as we've talked to the consumer and talk with the guests is, they're going to look to celebrate the holiday season, they're going to be focused on gifting and celebrating with their family and close friends. And we expect them to be in our stores and shopping online right till the very end of the holiday season.",0.6009005,0.966

And then my second question is just for -- as we look to 2021, obviously, there are some tough comparisons on the top line and maybe some tougher comparisons on the promotional from a lack of promotions this year. How are you thinking about the environment in 2021 as some retailers have to lap some of the tough comparisons? Or is it a function of the fact that there are many retailers that really can't be promotional because they don't have the balance sheet and capability to do that?",0.523946,0.118
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,122,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Karen, right now, we're very focused on the first half of 2021. And this is going to be a familiar theme, really taking some of the lessons learned from 2020, putting a premium on flexibility and agility. Because as Michael and I have both said, we, unfortunately, don't have that crystal ball as we look to the future. We're all looking for greater certainty. But we know we're going to go into the first half of 2021 facing the continued pandemic, waiting for vaccines, looking for greater clarity around the condition of the economy and unemployment. And I think we're going to just have to make sure that we remain flexible and provide the assortment and the services and the safety that the guest is looking for from Target.",0.1023332,0.929

We think guests will continue to consolidate the number of locations where they shop. We think our multi-category portfolio will continue to be very important as we serve the needs of families. We think ease and convenience, combined with safety, will continue to be important. And we'll continue to deliver great value. So Michael talked about our continued focus on market share and the market share opportunities that are in front of us. And I think we'll be very focused on continuing to build off of the market share gains that we achieved in 2020 and further share opportunities in 2021.",0.257061,0.987

Just -- I'm curious if you can quantify the percent of your sales increase that's being driven by new customers versus existing customers. Curious about the store comp, if you could talk traffic versus ticket. And then, Brian, you mentioned, I think the top quartile of your stores are doing $500 a foot. Curious if you looked at that top quartile, let's say, as of 2019 versus the bottom quartile, how are each of those performing this year in 2020?",0.7003684,0.869
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,126,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Why don't I start, and then I'll ask for both John and Michael to provide a perspective? But I'll start with the recognition that on an average week, we see well over 30 million guests shopping our stores. And as you've seen in our third quarter results, we've seen traffic continue to grow at a rate of 4.5%, basket expand over 15%, and certainly, there are a mix of new guests to Target.",0.4277528,0.818
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,127,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the Target guests and the families that shop us each and every week are visiting us more frequently. They're certainly shopping more categories. And that's creating greater trips either to our stores or to our fulfillment channels and they're shopping a wider array of categories to take advantage of our multi-category portfolio. So we're seeing both growth with our existing guests and new guests to Target and to target.com. Mike, can you give perspective on top-tier versus lower-tier store performance?",0.4457634,0.874
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,128,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I'll take that really quickly. As you'd imagine, given just the magnitude of the number of stores, those tiers tend to move in unison. So we talked about the top tier being up, the bottom tier move the same amount. And any individual store will have its own story. But in quartile, they tend to move pretty consistently.",0.1809251,0.791
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,129,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think the only thing I'd add is we look at our performance, our comps by geography each and every week. And we're seeing very consistent results literally across the 3. From both coasts and the heartland of America and in the southern market, really consistent comp and growth performance, so certainly, it's not one or two markets that are driving it. It's not our top-tier stores versus some of our lower-volume stores. We're seeing a consistent lift across the entire fleet of stores and obviously, very strong growth in our digital channels.",0.275481,0.888

The question I'm not going to ask is to John, on whether there's enough capacity for the holiday season. I think the point is very well made there.

I would tell you, our store teams and the Shipt team continue to execute our same-day services at a very, very high level. And I think you hit on one of the things we've been very focused on this year, which is really assortment expansion. For Drive Up and for Pick Up, that has meant adding frozen, refrigerated and fresh foods. We are on a trajectory when we started the year to add it to about 300 stores.",0.1555465,0.937
TGT-2020-Q3-2020-11-18,133,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We obviously paused in the early spring. And then as things started to open up, really proud of the way our store teams responded and decided we could execute that across our properties team, supply chain and stores to get that in close to 1,600 of our stores today. And so that's available. And that's been a huge win for our guests. We see the unit increases, the number of units in the basket increase as guests start shopping that.

Right along with that, in OPU and Drive Up, with Order Pick Up and Drive Up, we've added adult beverage, another key category for us where, again, it just tops off the basket. So, a real guest satisfier, and we'll continue to work to add other categories at Shipt.

It's been plain remarkable. My question, I'm sorry, I'm going to ask two. Brian, you mentioned Shipt.

And it's a key part of what we're going to do here in the fourth quarter, we think you see us throughout the fourth quarter really lean into our same-day service and Order Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt as a way -- our way to fulfill our guest needs, and Shipt will be a big part of that.",0.009824,0.843

They continue to add retailers that are over 100 national and regional retailers. They added Bed Bath & Beyond this quarter in addition to a few others.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I want to pause and comment on that April digital performance for a moment, because I suspect that many of you might have wondered whether our operations could sustain such a strong increase for an entire month. After all, to put this volume into perspective, on an average day in April, our operations were fulfilling many more items and orders than last year's Cyber Monday, a day for which we had planned months ahead of time.",0.9410561,0.572

TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,32,Remarks,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But I'd reiterate that it comes down to two factors: our strategy of using our stores as hubs and the ability of our team to quickly pivot to meet shifting demand.

On these calls over the last few years, I've described our long-term journey in operations to completely transform our supply chain and fulfillment infrastructure, moving from our prior linear model based exclusively on store shopping to a unique modern structure, designed to support a broad array of fulfillment choices; to position our stores as the hub for guest fulfillment, whether a guest trip is based on traditional shopping, use of one of our same-day services, or delivering a package to their front door; to invest in technology, data and analytics to increase our inventory accuracy and better forecast demand throughout the network, leading to improved in-stocks, higher guest satisfaction, and ultimately, stronger sales; to transform how we collect and build store sites, moving from a rigid large format prototype model to a model in which we focus first on the neighborhood we want to serve, design a store to fit within the available space, and then curate a merchandise assortment to fit that particular neighborhood; and finally, to transform our store team, moving from a model based on general athletes to one in which different parts of the team have accountability for individual businesses, supported by tools and processes that allow them to make decisions in real-time and focus on serving our guests in new ways.",0.3814982,0.975

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As Brian already described, over the course of the first quarter, our team had to pivot dramatically and rapidly in response to multiple changes in shopping behavior, comps and Essentials and Food and Beverage moving from single digits in February to peaks above 50% in March, before settling down into the teens in April.",1.0163733,0.0

With this volatility and category sales, managing our inventory has also presented a significant challenge.",1.0163733,0.807
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,51,Remarks,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In apparel, given the recent dramatic slowdown in sales, teams have been working closely with vendors to make appropriate changes based on our current inventory and future purchases.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In other categories like Home and Electronics, we've been increasing order quantities to match the higher pace of sales. However, given that many of these categories are primarily imported, we will likely see some persistent out-of-stocks until we can receive replenishment inventory from these overseas producers.",0.7482603,0.361

The ability of our team and our network to attain and sustain digital comps of nearly 300% for the entire month of April has been incredible to watch. There are too many stats to share, but I'll tick through a few, because I think they're helpful in understanding how remarkable it's been.",0.5894392,0.918

TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,58,Remarks,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"These growth numbers reflect the fact that Drive-Up continues to be our most popular service.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And while we have temporarily slowed down our plans for remodels and new stores because of the crisis, that doesn't mean we have less enthusiasm for these projects. Rather, we slowed down our plans for two specific reasons: first, we wanted to remove obstacles and distractions facing our team, so they could focus exclusively on day-to-day execution in the face of extreme volatility across multiple dimensions of our business; and second, we adjusted our plans in anticipation of construction process changes needed to accommodate social distancing and other measures, which we expect to slow down timelines in some cases.",0.3233729,-0.69

Among the drivers of our comp growth, comparable traffic was down 1.5% and average ticket was up 12.5%, as guests consolidated their shopping trips into fewer bigger baskets. Among channels, store comparable sales increased to 0.9%, while digital comp sales grew 141%.

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"First, we incurred hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental costs, including inventory impairments, resulting from the severe slowdown in apparel sales. For context on these costs, it's important to note that prior to the first quarter, comp sales in apparel and accessories had been growing more than 5%, but quickly decelerated to more than a 20% decline in the first quarter.

We actually saw really strong performance in the first quarter, as operating cash flow grew nearly $1 billion compared with last year.

While the year-over-year decline looks good on the cash flow statement, it reflects the lack of availability and elevated out-of-stocks we're seeing in multiple categories.

I had a great answer that you heard none of, so I'll try to do my best paraphrasing again. To decompose margin a little bit more, if I had to dimensionalize it into the three biggest drivers of what we saw in Q1, the first would be a set of merchandising actions that we took throughout the quarter. And the biggest of which, to your question, was the inventory write-downs and adjustments that we made especially in apparel, given the deceleration we saw in apparel throughout the better part of Q1. That's probably the biggest factor.",0.0609906,0.904

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then, as I mentioned in my remarks, category mix at about 150 basis points would be the second biggest factor. And then the third would be the pressure from supply chain in general, and there's a couple of things there.

Brian, I want to kind of think about this uncertainty in the macro from a different angle. How do you think about consolidation of the industry going forward, whether that be through your digital capabilities, or whether that be through, quite frankly, retailers that don't reopen their doors?

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I also think from a consumer standpoint, as we survey our guests and as we talk to consumers, I think, we're going to see a consolidation in how people shop. And I think our multi-category portfolio positions us very well in an environment where today's consumer is looking to make fewer stops and the ability to come to Target and pick up their food and beverage needs, their household essentials, their beauty products, their home apparel items, and their household essentials and Hardlines each and every week, makes us an attractive choice in a consolidating environment.",0.8002456,0.869

Actually, just some follow-up on digital. One was on Shipt. I was wondering if you could talk about the membership growth that you saw in the first quarter and we've seen pretty dramatic app download data on Shipt? And also are you signing up a lot more partners on Shipt?",0.0880561,0.949
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,205,Question,2020-05-20,1,2020,Robert Ohmes,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"And then my follow-up would just be, maybe for Brian or John or Michael, just with this huge digital volume, are there anything you're learning about, whether it's going to be tougher, easier over the long-term, as you average out at much higher digital volumes? Are you seeing new ways to get the profitability up that maybe you weren't seeing before this big ramp up in volume? Thanks.",0.1550884,0.888
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,206,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Robbie, why don't we let John start by talking about the outstanding performance we saw with Shipt, and then we'll come back and talk about digital profitability over time.",0.1076545,0.727
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,207,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Good morning, Robbie, good to talk to you. Shipt, consistent with everything else we've said about digital, has seen - saw significant acceleration and that they and their team did an outstanding job hiring into that or getting Shipt shoppers. Order volume over the course of the quarter for Shipt business independent of Target's portion of that order volume was up two times. In April, it was up three times. They had 60% growth in membership. So a significant acceleration in members.",0.5734752,0.933
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,208,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"They engaged 100,000 additional shoppers, so doubling the number of shoppers they had going into the quarter. And so a significant acceleration across Target. We saw a 300% increase in sales to last year through our Shipt channel. So again, significant acceleration there.",0.3422022,0.852
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,209,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And like I said, on the previous caller that probably perhaps most importantly, the NPS score, very, very high. And they maintained that throughout the quarter, a few dips when sales really accelerated quickly within a week to 10 days. But beyond that, the team did an exceptional job and really getting shoppers to meet that demand. And so we're really enthusiastic about the Shipt performance and encouraged by what we saw.",0.2586983,0.871
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,210,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I can maybe just chime in on the prospects for increased efficiency over time. We've seen across wherever we've had growth, whether it's the growth in Drive-Up over the last several years, order pickup, volume helps us. And with volume, we can bring efficiency. When it comes to digital, as John mentioned, we've been investing in planning and the capability to support this volume. We just thought it'd be three years from now.",0.4658207,0.95
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,211,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so we've seen an acceleration for what we would expect it to take three years that's now happened in a matter of weeks. And so as we get the chance to optimize some of our operations against that volume, we should be able to drive increased deficiency over time.",0.3246009,0.751
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,212,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the thing I'm most excited about on the digital front that we've touched on a little bit already, is just the opportunity, we have to capture relevance with guests as their shopping habits change. We know over the long run that when guest behavior changes, and that's why a family with a new baby in the house is such an important guest milestone for us where we want to show up, because that's when shopping habits can change.",0.3295129,0.765

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Back to college, the first time you move into your new home, those milestones matter to us as a retailer and always have, because that's when shopping habits can change. And I think across America right now, we're seeing an acceleration in the change of shopping habits as it relates to digital. And the way we've shown up with 280-plus percent growth in digital on April means, we're capturing a lot of that mindshare and those new routines as they're forming.",0.2578797,0.402
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,214,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Robbie, I just - I'd finish up by going back to our strategy and using our stores as fulfillment hubs. And as we talked about our performance with digital, although 141% growth rate is a stunning number, the number I really focuses on is the same-day fulfillment, which grew by 278%. And that was all fulfilled by our stores.",0.7945149,0.883
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,215,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if you actually look at a different metric, if we think about store-fulfilled comps during the first quarter, we grew by 10.8% overall. If I look at that store-fulfilled comp number that increased by over 9%. It means our stores are driving tremendous productivity and they are the center of our strategy. And that's a number you'll hear us talk about more and more and more.",0.493246,0.402
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,216,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So when we talk about store comps during the quarter, they look relatively low at just under 1%. But those stores actually drove over 9% comp growth during the quarter. And from an economic standpoint, we know over time, that's a really healthy and profitable transaction.",0.7228817,0.769
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,217,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the stores did tremendous work during this quarter. And America turned to Target stores, because they trust our service and our liability and rewarded us with a store-fulfilled comp of over 9%. Operator, we have time for only one last question.",0.1989357,0.691

And when I think about the quarter and some of the learning from the quarter, I'll have to go back with the importance of stores. And at the start of the pandemic and we've talked about the different chapters, America turned to Target stores and that's where we saw the uptick. That's where they came for household essentials to stop - stock up on food and beverage.",1.1207532,0.077
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,221,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When America was asked to shelter in place, they started to use our same-day fulfillment channels, and we're picking up in-store and driving to our parking lots to use Drive-Up, or using a Shipt shopper. But when I think about the quarter, it just reinforces to me the important role that stores play, both our traditional stores and even our smaller formats in urban markets.",0.8440442,0.494
TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,222,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The number of e-mails I've received from guests in New York City and Boston and Chicago thanking us for that small format in their neighborhood that supplies all of their household and family needs during the pandemic.

I think to the last half of your question about inventory allocation, inventory placement, as you know, we've been developing analytics and technology across something we call inventory, planning and control, IPC. We're about a third of the way into that deployment.",1.2091691,0.0

TGT-2020-Q1-2020-05-20,225,Answer,2020-05-20,1,2020,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then from an automation perspective, we've talked about we had analytics or a automation pilot going on in Minneapolis, also at Perth. In Minneapolis, we actually deployed that automation to four more locations. We have not started that up yet, because that will require some travel and we want to - we will take the safety of our teams into account as we think about getting back into the travel game. But when we are able to do that, we'll get that to four more locations this year and then continue to expand.",0.1182972,0.66

When it comes to store automation, I think, we've shown the ability to scale very, very rapidly with our teams and with the technology that we have provided them. And so we feel very, very good about the productivity and scalability and reliability of our current processes in teams, and we'll continue to explore other avenues as we go forward to improve that.",0.3024969,0.874

In the face of these challenges, there are countless stories of our team coming together to support each other and their communities, in the face of heartbreaking devastation.

We made a decision to ramp up the investments of that cash in both capital and operating margin to speed up our progress. Today, we have a very healthy business that generates lots of cash, a business that has seen two consecutive quarters of healthy traffic growth giving us increased confidence as we enter the holiday season.",0.9942693,0.978

Enabled by this year's investments and the tireless efforts of our team, we have an outstanding set of plans this year. And while it's still very early, we've been encouraged with the guest response to the launch of Hearth and Hand, as well as last week's release of the Target exclusive version of Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation. While the bulk of the season is still ahead of us, we are very happy to see how these early efforts have set the tone for the season, as we are already showing our guests that Target will offer unique holiday merchandise and experiences that you can't find anywhere else.",0.3131396,0.98

As Brian mentioned earlier, a key priority of our work and operations is based on the goal to provide new and reliable fulfillment options for our guests. As of today, we have multiple new fulfillment options that are in some phase of testing or rollout across our network. We offer in-store pickup of digital orders, available in all of our store locations. We have a Drive Up service which we just began testing at 50 locations in the Twin Cities. We now have same-day delivery which we're testing at four stores in New York City. We offer next-day delivery through Target Restock, which is now available for 90 million guests in 11 markets. And we have a ship-from-store capability which is now in more than 1,400 of our locations.",2.1845148,0.7

Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Of those five fulfillment options, only two were available as we entered the year, in-store pickup and ship-from-store. And while both of those options are relatively mature, we continue to increase the amount of our digital volume handled by our stores. Today, the stores are already fulfilling more than half of our total digital volume through the pickup and ship-from-store capabilities, and that will peak at well above 80% in the days leading up to Christmas. In fact, our stores are planning to ship over 30 million units related to digital orders in the peak four weeks of the holiday season, up from about 18 million units last year.",2.9718451,0.836
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,30,Remarks,2017-11-15,3,2017,John J. Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Among the new fulfillment capabilities we've launched this year, Target Restock has been ramping up quickly. During the third quarter, we rolled out this service to an additional 10 markets across the country. We also extended the deadline for next-day delivery to 7 PM and expanded the number of eligible items to more than 15,000. The average value of a Restock order is about 50% larger than an average store transaction and we're pleased that our stores have been able to fill these orders reliably and efficiently.",0.4977376,0.832

Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Another capability we've just begun rolling out this year is same-day delivery, which we are now offering at four stores in the New York City market. For a small fee, typically between $5 and $10 depending on the address, guests can leave their basket with us at check out and arrange for delivery later the same day in a time window of their choosing. Guests in these stores are enthusiastically responding to this service. Basket sizes for delivery transactions are running six to nine times the average transaction across the four stores that have the service. And our home category continues to account for more than half of the total sales on these delivery orders.",0.5067873,0.527

We rolled out this service to 50 stores in the Twin Cities in the third quarter and we're pleased with the early results. Specifically, guest survey scores for this service are running well ahead of goal, and the stores are outperforming our goal for average wait time.

Our ultimate goal is to build a supply chain that can reliably deliver any item in our network to all but the most remote areas in the U.S. in two days or less, with most items delivered in one day. While a large percentage of our digital orders today are already arriving that quickly, we have more work to do before we can reliably deliver in that timeframe across all of our assortment.",0.1397687,0.0

While we have already made progress on all of these measures, we still have a lot more to do and our new flow center in Perth Amboy, New Jersey will help us get there. We added this building to our network, not because we needed the capacity, but because it will allow our team to learn in a separate facility without the distraction of operating in tandem with the rest of our operations. It's managed by a very lean team that operates like a startup, rapidly building solutions from scratch and iterating as they learn. They run their operations with all new systems and processes developed in-house, including their inventory planning system, order management system, warehouse management system and transportation.",0.6465561,0.905

Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"This facility is now serving five of our new small format stores in New York City, which allows them to test these new systems under the most extreme conditions. Specifically, these stores generate very high sales per square foot and have little to nonexistent backroom storage space. As a result, they require rapid replenishment. In fact, our new Herald Square and Tribeca locations are receiving multiple shipments a day from this facility.",1.1256913,0.0

Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"When these stores receive merchandise, they don't have the room or the time to unpack and store anything more than they need. To address this constraint, the Perth Amboy facility packs custom shipments for each store which are delivered in bins organized by aisle of the store. As a result, these stores can rapidly move deliveries right on to the sales floors and quickly replenish shelves from the pre-sorted bins. This minimizes the amount of store labor devoted to replenishment allowing the team to devote more of their time to serving their guests. Once the new process reaches a higher level of maturity, we'll be able to scale up within the facility, incorporate automation into the process and begin replicating this model elsewhere in the network.",1.282554,0.649
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,37,Remarks,2017-11-15,3,2017,John J. Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So now, while I hope it's clear that fulfillment and speed are huge areas of focus for the operations team, I want to be clear that's not our only priority. We are also investing to reach guests in new neighborhoods and elevate the experience in all of our stores. To reach new densely populated neighborhoods, we've completely changed our approach to choosing the location for our small format stores. In the past, we had a relatively rigid prototype for a store's size and layout, and our real estate team focused on finding sites that would accommodate that prototype. Today, when we find space available in an attractive neighborhood, we custom design a store that can fit the available space. These stores generate high sales productivity and higher-than-average gross margin rates, driving strong returns on investment. And for the smaller group of these stores that have now been operating for more than a year, we continue to see very healthy growth in both traffic and comparable sales.",0.4112619,0.971

Like our new small stores, we apply a custom approach to our remodel projects based on condition of each store and characteristics of the neighborhood. In all cases, when we remodel a store, we focus on convenience, including the incorporation of self-checkout and a separate area for store pickup. And we upgrade the shopping experience for our guests, incorporating more across merchandising opportunities. We carefully measure the financial performance of our remodeled stores, and we continue to see an average sales acceleration of 2% to 4%, right in line with our goals for the program.",0.3423831,0.834

The strength of our team was evident as we rolled out four new brands in our stores in the third quarter. Our team presented these new brands better than we ever have before playing a key role in their early success. This has been an amazing year of change for our operations team.

And while we're seeing steady improvement in frequency categories, these areas are facing some near-term headwinds from this year's investment to be priced right every day. As a result of this effort, which was completed late in the third quarter, we're seeing stronger unit share improvements in many frequency categories compared with dollar share.

This is best evidenced in produce where we've been investing in freshness, organics, in-stocks and specialized store labor where we saw a high-single digit comp increase in the quarter.

Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The third quarter depreciation and amortization line was about $70 million higher than last year. This increase reflects the impact of accelerated depreciation related to next year's remodel program, which will transform about three times as many stores compared with this year. We recently finalized our specific store remodel plans for next year and subsequently refined our D&A forecast by quarter. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we expect a similar or somewhat smaller year-over-year increase in the D&A expense line than we just experienced in the third quarter. And as we look ahead to 2018, our current view is that quarterly D&A will be about $80 million higher than 2017 in each of the first three quarters next year, reflecting the continued recognition of accelerated depreciation on next year's much larger group of remodels.",0.0110259,0.637

This represents a change from the trend we've seen in recent quarters in which our inventory has declined even as we've maintained a strong in-stock position. This quarter's increase reflects a year-over-year change in the timing of our holiday season inventory.

You mentioned several times throughout the call, and frankly throughout the year, that you are trying to take a conservative approach to planning, but you also mentioned - and you also mentioned the strength and the confidence you have as this quarter - that you just reported in the prior quarter happened in the traffic and the merchandising.

I think sitting here today, we feel very confident that we're making very good progress against the plans that we set out earlier this year. If I think about the state of our business today, we're seeing a great response to the eight new brands that we've launched. As we've remodeled now over 100 stores, we continue to see the lift that we were projecting up 2% to 4%. We've seen a tremendous response to our new small formats that we've been opening up in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. And as you know, we opened up a number of new stores in this last quarter.

And during the quarter again, we saw very strong digital growth, and that's been underpinned by the progress we've made from a digital fulfillment standpoint and some of the things that John talked about during his prepared remarks.

Just - I mean, do you think that that's an ongoing process that you're going to have to do? How are you - you mentioned some of the measurements you're using on that, but just trying to understand is that something you let ride here for the fourth quarter and then reassess where you are next year, or do you feel like you've gotten yourself to a spot where there's going to be no further adjustments required?",,0.666

So we're going to continue to make sure that we're committed to offering great value, that we're priced right daily. And during the fourth quarter, we'll provide exciting promotions to support those items that we know our guests are going to be interested in shopping for at Target. So it's an ongoing commitment.

I think we've said since February, we're going to invest in the labor in our stores, invest in training, invest in having experts in the store, invest in having people on the sales floor and changing the operating model for those stores. So that's an important part of what we're doing.

And we feel really good about utilizing the stores that are the closest, fastest and cheapest way to get merchandise to our guests. They have significant capabilities now. We're doing same day, next day, two day, pickup, Drive Up, all kinds of ways to meet the guests' needs, and I think that's the important factor, all centered around using the store as the hub.

So I guess my first question really is around the fourth quarter and the comparisons that you were facing last year.

John underscored the fact that we've got an expanded array of digital fulfillment capabilities. Mark's talked about the progress we've made from both a brand standpoint, but also a value standpoint. I think we continue to enhance our digital capabilities. So I think we enter this season in a much stronger position.

And second question for you, I just want to - I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but I was hoping that maybe you could talk about the puts and the takes in terms of what we should be thinking about, areas that you could see outsized investment. D&A is going to be a headwind next year, wages clearly seem like they'll be a headwind, your thoughts on price investments from here. The Street's sort of looking for a modest decline in earnings. Seems like something like that - larger than that's possible. I just - I don't know how much at this point, Brian, you can help with that, but I think it is an area that we're all sort of wrestling with.",2.216189,0.969

Obviously, we're not going to provide 2018 guidance today. But I'll give you a preview. You're going to hear us talk about many of the same things we've been talking about this year: Our commitment to the store experience and continuing to remodel stores across the country. Our commitment to opening up new small formats in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. Our continued commitment to digital. Our commitment to enhancing our fulfillment capabilities.

So we've been sharing this year that we took a journey in terms of ensuring we were priced right daily and that we were able to create and communicate to our guests the right value, and that started in April of this year and we completed that through the end of the third quarter. What we've seen with that is, we had an expectation that that's not an immediate (49:01) response we need to build, ongoing deeper trust with the guests and get them to connect with that priced right daily ethos and we've seen a really fast reaction, a positive reaction to that.",0.1919643,0.96

And as a result, we're seeing an increase in our unit velocity and we fully expected and banked in some of the short-term sales deflation that we would see as a result.

We know, I think we've made a lot of progress in in-stocks given our current capabilities, but we also said in order to really solve the problem, we need to fix some fundamental capabilities in our supply chain around speed, reliability, inventory placement, and that's where we are on the journey.",0.0744093,-0.104
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,125,Answer,2017-11-15,3,2017,John J. Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, the inventory increase at the end of Q3, as Mark said, more related to us being sure we're ready for the fourth quarter in categories like electronics, Hearth and Hand, where we took positions, intentional inventory positions, to increase inventories in advance of the fourth quarter, less to do with our management of day-to-day in-stocks/out-of-stocks. We continue to work on those. And as I said, there's the short term working within our current capabilities and then the longer term solve that comes as we continue to improve our overall supply chain capabilities.",0.0708899,0.954

TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,128,Answer,2017-11-15,3,2017,John J. Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah. I wouldn't compare to third quarter. Compared to last year, we are doing more fulfillment in-store. As we said, we think that's the most cost-effective way given the total P&L, so shipping plus store labor, we think that's the most cost-effective way to do it. Compared to last year, we saw significant spikes last year near the end of the quarter, approaching 80% fulfillment. And I would say, when we get into that 80% range what really goes up is store pickup, and we'll take that model all day long, highly efficient for us, highly profitable from a digital perspective. So, when our mix gets that high in-store, we actually like the economics a lot.",0.4278532,0.895

Just to revisit, the fact that you do have this very depressed compare from a year ago and you're actually entering Q4 with pretty good gross margin momentum, down only very nominally in Q3 as some of your new brands are really starting to get traction. So, is your thinking on the expectation of a declining gross margin simply a factor of more business being done online each year and the cost of fulfillment associated with that, or are some of the new fulfillment options that you're introducing just somewhat more costly and you're giving yourself rooms to absorb that pressure?",0.1628842,-0.033

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, Matt, I'd only build on a couple of the comments that Cathy made: One, we feel very good about the performance of our owned brands, and from a gross margin standpoint, both short term and long-term, that's going to be very beneficial to our mix. Two, we are clearly investing in digital and digital capabilities, and expect that we're going to continue to see strong digital growth in the fourth quarter.",0.0683586,0.927
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,137,Answer,2017-11-15,3,2017,Brian C.

So we noted that the year-on-year penetration seems to have stabilized this quarter after having shown some increases for a period of time. Anything to glean from the stabilization of that trend?,0.0499856,0.772
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,139,Answer,2017-11-15,3,2017,Catherine R. Smith,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We are really excited about some of the capabilities we're adding to REDcard coming into this fourth quarter. I have to tell you, I'm one of the early users for our wallet application, and it is phenomenally fast and convenient and great experience for the guests. So as we've continued to ramp up some exclusives around REDcard, our guests are responding. We're seeing additional capabilities come into REDcard holders, our best guests into the fourth quarter, so I would expect that we'll see that trend continuing to be favorable.",0.2262704,0.934

Matt, I think we also recognize that as a byproduct of the investments we've been making in our stores, our brands, moving into new neighborhoods, we're bringing in new guests to Target. So over time, we certainly want to convert them to REDcard holders. But I think what we're seeing is, as we move into new catchments, these are new guests that are shopping at Target. Over time, they'll start adapting to our REDcard. I think our new brands are bringing new guests into our stores, and I think the focus that we've placed around value is also attracting a new shopper.",0.2247237,0.856
TGT-2017-Q3-2017-11-15,141,Answer,2017-11-15,3,2017,Brian C. Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So over time, that provides us tremendous opportunities to continue to build REDcard penetration. And one of the metrics that we haven't talked about on the call is the fact that traffic was up 1.4%. And that's existing guests shopping more often, but it also is new guests coming to our stores and our site.

I think our guest survey scores there, NPS scores, are frankly off the charts. We see a high utility.

Sometimes they're larger, sometimes it's I need one thing. And the same is very true for pickup in-store, driven by - it can be driven by promotional cadence, it can be driven by convenience. There's lots of different reasons people choose that option, and so the basket varies. There's nothing really to glean from that other than for both of them we see very high NPS scores for our guests which is the most important thing from our perspective.",0.9074912,0.635

Cornell,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Robby, why don't I clear up the question around guidance for the quarter, and really I'll focus on the full year. I think our fourth quarter guidance is a reflection of the performance we've been delivering throughout the year. And I'll go back and note, as Cathy discussed, our full year guidance is up $0.50. Now, I'll do the math for you. That's $500 million of improvement versus our original guidance. So we certainly approach the fourth quarter with a level of balance and conservatism, but feel good about the momentum that we have and we think the performance we've been delivering throughout the year will be reflected in our fourth quarter.",0.3855915,0.846

My question was around fulfillment as well and a little bit longer term in nature. I had wondered with regards to the Drive Up and the same-day delivery, if there are any early indications of what the limitations might be in terms of where you can introduce that.

I'll let John talk about the profitability component, but, Kate, I think one of the great things about our strategy is the important role our stores play. And as we think about Drive Up, we think about same-day, those are going to be enabled by the 1,800 stores that are in neighborhoods around the country. So we should be able to continue to expand that over time and meet the needs of our guests no matter where they live and which store they shop in.",0.7187884,0.925

Mulligan,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And on your question about profitability, clearly, the closer we are to the store, the better we like it. When a guest comes in and takes it off the shelf, great. Only slightly disadvantage to that would be pickup or Drive Up because there is one more touch, but really again economically a great, great solution for us. As we get into shipping, same-day delivery is more expensive. There's no question about that. And at least today, our guest research leads us to believe guests understand that. They want it priced right, they want the convenience, and they understand there may be a charge to get it to them at the time they wanted during that day. And we've seen that in the four stores in New York, no pushback at all in the delivery charge.",0.3076923,0.949

And so there are markets where that will work - that type of transaction will work really well. There are other markets where, as you said, there'll be standard two-day shipping in there. We're working hard to reduce cost throughout that shipping while improving the speed.
