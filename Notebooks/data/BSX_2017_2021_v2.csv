Clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins and we hit EPS, and in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about. But we do anticipate moving forward that the impact on COVID in the Company has decreased upon each surge.",0.698941,0.867
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,55,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time, and so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. One great thing about our portfolio is we're primarily interventional medicine Company, and I was at a couple of sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their WATCHMAN volume outpatient now.",0.12011,0.0
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,56,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So you've seen a dramatic shift in WATCHMAN, for example, outpatient procedure. I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges, and in the quarter, where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the Company, I think the performance is quite good.",0.4,0.0

Maybe shifting over to some of the businesses. I'd love to get a sense of what you're seeing out in the field. I know it's early, but you have some competition coming from WATCHMAN. I would love to hear what you're seeing there and just how you feel about your positioning and how we should be thinking about trialing of competitive products in the near term.",1.0950489,0.459

Clearly, the competition will have some trialing benefit, but I would say, I've been in the field extensively in Europe last week and as well as U.S. this week and probably never been more enthusiastic about the future of WATCHMAN. I made a comment earlier about the procedural trends, how efficient the procedure is being done with the WATCHMAN FLX.",0.9549168,0.791

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Every doctor that I've spoken with, which is quite a few in our field, doctors that have transitioned, which 99.9% of them from Amulet, from 2.5 to WATCHMAN FLX, have increased utilization significantly, and they've done that because of the safety profile of the device and the outcomes that they're getting, and then you see, right now, we have some additional product enhancements being launched with the delivery catheter, and we have a cadence of additional platforms being developed over the next two years as well as expanding clinical outcomes.",0.2487141,0.927
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,62,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F.

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great, and maybe just on the other side of the house, you yourself have several new disposable scopes launching. I know it was a tough environment over the past 12-plus months to get into hospitals and set up accounts, but maybe just the latest update on where you were in third quarter and where you think you'll be in fourth quarter with those launches, and the environment, and receptivity so far?

BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,64,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say on EXALT D, it's commentary somewhere to previous calls where we continue to chip away at it, I would say. We're making progress primarily in the U.S. with capital placements, utilization continues to improve, and importantly, we had an additional launch this quarter, the 1.5 EXALT D, which will address some ease-of-use enhancements in the platform, which doctors are anxious for us. I think that'll help, and it will be a nice growth driver for Endo in 2022.",0.58941,0.735
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,65,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say coming out of the quarter, we're more bullish on EXALT B, I would say. The performance of that platform is quite good in terms of its section capability, and our team is ramping up supply chain manufacturing capabilities to enhance supply for EXALT B in 2022. So the combination will continue to, along with AXIOS and a lot of other products in Endo, continue to drive Endo to be nicely accretive to the Company going forward here.",1.3440242,0.66

For the fourth quarter, there's somewhat larger range than usual of 12% to 16%.

BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,71,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",I don't think it assumes that. It assumes that we're within the 4% to 8% range versus 2019 and the 12% to 16% range versus 2020 in the fourth quarter for sale.,0.3730711,0.931
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,73,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As we saw in the third quarter, it's a little bit larger range than we're used to. But just as Mike detailed, the uncertainties around COVID and staff shortages and where we are, I think just provides for a larger range in the quarter. Again, 4% to 8%, we think at any point in that range is good growth versus 2019 and 12% to 16% versus 2020. But just given the uncertainty, feel it's appropriate to have a little bit larger range for the fourth quarter.",0.4868582,0.511

We'll hold off a few more months, but our LRP goals are 6% to 8% organic. We'll likely have an organic comp of 5-6 going into it versus '19 and a bigger comp versus in 2020. But anyway, so I mean, overall, you'd like to be optimistic because you think COVID impact will be less in '22 than it is in '21 based on the vaccination rates and the improvement in Asia, Europe, and hopefully, the US as well.",0.4874694,0.166
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,80,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So you'd like to see 2022 a better COVID environment. The staffing shortages are a bit of a challenge, but the hospitals do hustle and they figure out ways to get things done, but it does create a bit of a headwind, but after COVID should be better. In the backlog, you do see a backlog in some of our procedures. You see a WATCHMAN backlog and then other areas. So overall, I think the macro trends should point to better in '22 versus what we've seen in '21, given the vaccination rates broadly.",0.0366112,0.637
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,82,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's a nice new indication for us. As you know, DBS is a nice growing market. It's still very underpenetrated. It's a market that does well when COVID wanes and a market that does not do well when COVID surges. So hopefully, you'll see a improvement in fourth quarter across the board in the market, and particularly with us, and in '22 as COVID improves. But it doesn't do well when COVID surges because of the duration of the procedure time and the fact that it typically can be deferred a few months back to your backlog question.",0.1231467,0.899
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,83,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"On the business itself, they've done an amazing job. We weren't a player at all six, seven years ago, and now we're the Number 1 Denovo market share leader in Europe. I would say we're probably likely tied for Number 1 on Denovo market share in the U.S, and the team continues to add sales and commercial resources, and the new indication obviously will help that business in 2022, now that we're on label. It's a similar call point, a similar physician, the same commercial team that we have. It's almost like adjacency for us with the same physician and the same sales rep. So it should help the business in 2022, and again, I don't think I'm too optimistic, but I'm assuming COVID is broadly better in '22 versus '21. So that'll help the Neuromod DBS business.",0.8340465,0.947

First off, the annual IDE shows everyone again more data that just as a therapy left atrial appendage inclusion is safe and effective and is a fantastic alternative for patients who need that kind of therapy, and then that trial looked against our last generation device, a generation that's no longer sold in the U.S. and showed non-inferiority for safety and efficacy but a higher rate of procedural complications.

BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,96,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Vijay. Yeah. To be honest, we're extremely confident about WATCHMAN going into fourth quarter and full year '22. I made a few comments before that. First of all, WATCHMAN, the clinical results for WATCHMAN FLX are extraordinarily good, and doctors have tremendous confidence in the platform and they've been using it for about a year, and your average doctor is increasing their utilization of WATCHMAN every quarter because of the confidence that they have and the referring physician community is seeing their patients recover and get off of blood thinners and reduce the risk of stroke.",0.6877458,0.935
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,97,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So it's expanding the awareness when you're referring physician community, the GI community, the neuro community. So there's a lot of momentum there. The other important thing, I mentioned that productivity, even in COVID, you have hospitals dramatically moving WATCHMAN, limiting anesthesia, using ICE imaging, and doing procedures that are very, very efficient. In many cases, less than an hour, and the economics of WATCHMAN now are quite good across the U.S. So there's always headwinds and tailwinds across a diversified portfolio. But the tailwinds from reimbursement, procedural efficiency, clinical outcomes, new clinical data, product cadence are very, very positive with WATCHMAN.",0.507413,0.422

Mike, I appreciate all the commentary on COVID and improving and we're all in the same boat, we hope it's better heading into next year. But just the new dynamic here is the hospital labor shortage, and I'm just curious how you, as a Company, are helping hospitals manage through that?",0.5125567,0.796
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,103,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I've been in the field a lot recently and it is an issue for hospital CEOs. There's no doubt about it. They've had to increase their wages and labor force expenses to accommodate increasing wages for nurses and staff and so forth. So they're working through that process. But it's not going to be a short-term issue, but hospitals are pretty resilient, and as you know, a couple of things I would say that point specific to BSC and how that's changing is, just the use of telehealth, and telemedicine, and prescreening for patients has become very widespread and very efficient.",0.6623298,0.0
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,104,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That reduces down significantly the number of patient visits to the hospital, drives more efficiency and staff productivity. So I think you're going to continue to see that trend continue to increase. Another one more specific to Boston is, what I mentioned before is, we're not a surgery Company.",0.1355522,0.296
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,105,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we're not driving multi-day length of stays in a hospital. The portfolio shift, the shift to interventional medicine is helpful for hospitals, and it gets patients in and out of the clinic or outpatient setting typically in the same day, and you see more of our complex procedures because of the capabilities and the technology we have augmented by imaging move to more outpatient settings, and I made the comment on WATCHMAN, how that mix shift has moved more and more to same-day procedures.",0.6108926,0.586
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,106,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think a combination of telehealth, a combination of outpatient orientation, and same-day procedures is very helpful for our product mix, and hospitals, just like anybody else, they innovate and they find a way. So it is a headwind, but in the quarter here where we had staffing shortages and at surge, we grew okay, and I think the surges will calm and the staffing shorters will likely linger a bit. But hospitals are pretty resilient in figuring out ways to drive volume.",0.197882,0.361
BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,110,Question,2021-10-27,3,2021,Daniel J.

Are you taking share with some of these new products? Are you seeing accelerating momentum with some of these new categories?

BSX-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,111,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah, I think it should accelerate in a less COVID-impacted year for sure. You hit a number of the highlights. Our PI business has been very resilient, it drives consistent high performance. We're the Number 1 DCB player now in Japan. The team has done a great job with that launch, and the TheraSphere platform continues to do extremely well, and you saw that clinical data. So that division continues to do very well.

It'll close hopefully in fourth quarter, I guess, right? Pretty soon here. So we think it's a perfect fit for the PI portfolio. We have a lot of strength in our arterial business with our Eluvia and DCB.

So that we made an early investment in Devoro a number of years ago because we like their technology, we like their leadership team, and sure enough, they delivered quite well, and so we acquired them.

Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Anthony, I can take the one on the relative level of acuity of the procedures, and the short answer is it varies by business. If you look at cardiology and you look at peripheral, you look at cardiac rhythm management, those have held on and we're actually getting pretty good at this now at the number of waves we've had relative to COVID. Those are much more emergent and hold up better. Mike mentioned this earlier that businesses like Neuromodulation and urology, they come down very quickly in a COVID wave.",0.6638142,

So it's kind of a V-shaped curve for those businesses. They obviously don't perform as well in a COVID setting, but they come back very nicely on the other side. So there's not really one number you can point to for the whole Company and pinpoint it, it varies by business, but I think we've proven and have a good track record in a non-COVID environment that the business performs very well, and as Mike's comments preclude, that's what we're looking forward to in '22 and beyond.",0.5385086,

So just simple math that as Mike said allows us to do a small handful of tuck-ins, obviously much less than we did in '19.

So what drives that confidence? How much is predicated on business recovery versus selling days or certain deals going organic? And then I have a quick follow up.",1.0953786,0.918
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,87,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Yes. So I am really pleased. Essentially we're executing in line with what our annual plan was or it is. We knew that the second half required acceleration versus the first half. Now that is well thought out when we give our full year guidance as we updated that. So we're essentially in line with our plans, reiterating our full year 7% to 8% organic outlook, which does imply, obviously, acceleration in the third quarter fourth quarter.",0.9972769,0.937
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,88,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And it's pretty straightforward how we're going to deliver that. The first two are more mechanical. The first one being we have one less selling day in the first half. And the second half we have one more selling day and another more mechanical solution is some of our acquisitions become organic, NxThera, Augmenix and Claret. So that's - those are kind of the more mechanical ones that certainly helped accelerate the growth in the second half.",1.5636914,0.868
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,89,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But importantly in terms of the actual business, pleased to see that with the exception of EP all of our businesses continue to grow faster than their peer group. We have a lot of momentum. Specifically in the regions we're seeing Japan return to growth in the second quarter. We expect strong acceleration from our team in Japan based on the anniversary of price cuts that have recently occurred.",0.3524962,0.836
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,90,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","New product launches with Eluvia, which is building momentum in Japan. And also the recent news of reimbursement and approval for WATCHMAN, which we anticipate selling in September.",0.2290469,0.477
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,91,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So on a regional basis, we expect Asia to continue to accelerate. The US and Europe continue to perform strong and emerging markets continue to have a lot of momentum. And beyond that just the impact of our full year launches, you'll see greater acceleration of LOTUS Edge, which we're very pleased with the initial results of the second quarter, acceleration of our VICI stent, the WATCHMAN FLX approval in Europe and as well as SENTINEL supply and I would say broadly and supply our teams did a very nice job of just of executing our supply requirements.",0.2653555,0.946
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,92,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we have - we're in very good position with supply across the company, momentum across our businesses, new product launches that impact the second half more greatly, as well as the mechanical pieces of additional day selling and the operational to organic. So all that gives us a lot of confidence in the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter guidance that you can derive from that.",0.3655068,0.846
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,93,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,David Lewis,Thomas Weisel Partners,"Mike, very helpful and very clear. Just one quick follow-up on LOTUS. Thanks for the feedback on center traction and the number of centers. Can you give us any sense of average center of penetration from a case basis? Should we still expect this rollout to be controlled through the end of 2019? And did SENTINEL - frankly, was SENTINEL capacity still an issue here in the second quarter? Thanks so much.",0.8257129,0.912
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,94,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So SENTINEL, we don't have - we do not have the supplier constraints within SENTINEL that we had call it for the first half of the year. So that the ops team done a great job with that and so you'll start to see more SENTINEL usage in Europe, in combination with ACURATE and LOTUS.",0.4015129,0.743
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,95,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the European team has been more constrained. So you'll start to see some enhancements and growth in Europe with SENTINEL and opening more centers in the US. I think SENTINEL will be a strong second half story for us. Just anecdotally, I was at a couple of cases last week, a couple of live cases we saw with our TAVR valve which performed very well with SENTINEL and also SENTINEL being used with some competitive valves in low-risk patients and pretty shocking to see the amount of debris that some of these physicians received. So I think physicians are becoming very comfortable once they use SENTINEL in terms of its ease-of-use, as well as the impact from that. So a lot of focus there.",0.5606657,0.93

The 150 accounts that we expect to open. We're on track to deliver that. We're not going to provide kind of share data, or usage data by account. But I would say, this has been a long time coming to bring into the market. And anecdotally, I would say doctors are pleasantly surprised by the unique features that it delivers. The controlled uses of the device, the ability to reposition and the elimination of the PBL is delivering on its promise.",0.696823,0.936
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,97,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F.

BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,104,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So in our view, this is - we call it a upper single digit growth market.

BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,105,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F.

BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,106,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, when we look at our guidance for the second half of '19, we obviously are conservative and thoughtful about what our SCS projections are.

BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,109,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, just specific to your question, US SCS did decline in the second quarter kind of upper single digit and the OUS was up.

BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,117,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,And then one of the other things in SG&A in the quarter is if you look at the Neuromod P&L it's deleveraged and because of the growth again Mike detailed that very nicely in terms of the 31% comp from last year. So we're not making any fundamental changes to that business because we think that's a fantastic market 7% to 10% as we said.,0.3982274,0.855
BSX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,118,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So that has a little bit of impact in the quarter, that P&L is deleveraged. We're fine with that because we're going to keep that engine going for the long-term. But that's probably the key reasons. The launches and a little bit of a deleveraged Neuromod P&L in the quarter.",0.7069071,0.202

So we're closing our most strategic one BTG within the next - in August, we're aiming for, which will be great and we - it's been longer than we thought, given the B divestiture, but the team's ready to deliver on that. There is significant cost synergies and makes us the category leader in Interventional Oncology tools and products, I want go through all that.

So our pace of acquisitions certainly slowed down with one acquisition through almost end of July here. And so we do have capacity to do a couple of more tuck-in oriented acquisitions in 2019 if we wanted to. And some of the valuations are quite high and we do have a very prolific, I would say, DC portfolio that you'll see us acquire companies from that portfolio over the coming two years.

We just did the strap plan and I would say the team is executing really per our commitments for this year. This was what's the schedule for the acceleration of the second half given the days in the portfolio cadence that we have. You know, I think in terms of within that range, the structural heart business is a nice lever there with WATCHMAN, now this Japan approval with WATCHMAN, the continued momentum with LOTUS, SENTINEL and ACURATE.

First on EP and second on Neuromodulation, specifically SCS. EP is a plus grower for you, notwithstanding the growth has slowed. You talked about new product launches.

I think with EP this is a long-term commitment that we have in this business, given the size of the market and the growth profile and the overlap that we have on the call point capabilities.

We have strong growth in Europe where we have RHYTHMIA, its doing extremely well and our therapeutic catheter launch is doing quite well.",0.7040847,0.931

And US we don't have the portfolio, all the portfolio pieces that Europe has. So I think Europe's a good indicator for us for the future. And beyond RHYTHMIA, which is doing well and the DirectSense therapeutic catheter, we hope to bring a differentiated trial momentum to the market by the end of the fourth quarter time period.

The procedures that have been -- the new launch that have been impacted more significantly, specifically in second quarter, although we have seen improvement in the second half of June and the full month of July, really are products like LOTUS and EXALT D, which do require LOTUS another level of physician training when you're opening up new centers.

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, the first one, the comps are going to be very challenging with 2020 and 2021, and so forth for all companies, or for at least for us. But the underlying premise of Boston Scientific growing the high end of the peer group and we talked about a 6% to 9% growth rate in the past, but now the comps are a bit messed up. But given the pipeline that we have, the momentum that we have, most of our businesses continue to gain share versus their peers, the expansion and the new adjacencies that we have, we're very comfortable, nothing has changed in terms of our outlook being the high end of our peer group. And in the legacy works that 6% to 9% pre this comp issue. So I think the portfolio supports that.

Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then, David, relative to your question, obviously too early just given the uncertainty to start commenting on 2021 and beyond. Let me see if I can be helpful relative to the specifics because you started at gross margin and ended at operating margin. From a gross margin perspective, to the extent that sales get back to a more normal level as we continue to put quarters behind us. You leave those abnormal variances behind you, because they're in the P&L in the quarter that they're encouraged. So that's good news.",0.5116137,-0.083

We have therapy awareness reps who work with physicians to educate them on the benefits of WATCHMAN. And we have various digital channels to also help the physicians. And so, those capabilities are shown that it's more than just working the backlog. We have seen new patients entering the system that are getting WATCHMAN procedures.

With WATCHMAN flex, I can't really comment as to the guidance on that one except for this is a product that has done extremely well in Europe, the clinical trial enrolled, very quickly.

So it's a bit -- makes up a big slice of our business today in a pre-COVID world. And now in a COVID world you're seeing hospitals, not radically but shifting more procedures that are possible to an outpatient setting. And so we think that makes sense, given the fact that we're a primarily interventional medicine company. We think that the long term tailwind and where you want to be positioned versus potentially you know, more of a surgically oriented company.

But the likelihood that for many quarters to come, I think we're not going to see the level of travel that that we would have traveled in meetings, entertainment that we would have as a company.

We have seen improvement in July versus June. I think it's likely a combination of many of our procedures can't be deferred forever. Like we've commented in the first quarter calls, I think that's playing out. I think many hospitals and patients are aware that they need to have procedures done.

And so I think the portfolio mix helps. The outpatient care setting helps, and hospitals and patients do these procedures and they're finding a way to coexist, but there are impacts. When you have Florida and Texas have flare ups like this, they are still doing procedures, but it does have some impact. So that's why we've continued to spend guidance, because it's not all perfect out there, the hospitals are struggling, you're seeing flare ups. And so that's why we're very optimistic.

I think the post COVID world try to represent [Ph] what that would be like. But the post COVID world as I wear my mask here. I really just kind of repeat some of the trends I have. I think, the fact that we are a interventional medicine company that is always enabling, less length of stay in hospital, and all the new adjacencies that are being created through interventional medicine. You look at what's happened interventional cardiology, and how we're expanding in their vessel. Sorry, interventional cardiology interventional oncology. The adjacencies we have in endoscopy.

I don't think that changes in the post COVID world. And we continue to develop in our global footprint. China continues to perform very well for us. And we continue to layer on that strategy.

You know what's happening with telehealth with physicians. The acceptance of digital training has certainly accelerated in the past 90 days, whether it be remote proctoring, remote server supports, remote clinical supports. So I think the capabilities all wrapped around digital will enhance product offerings potentially, make it less expensive.

But we obviously spend a ton of time as well looking at that post COVID world.

You heard in the script there 6.5 to 8.5. We think 200 basis points wide range isn't crazy for a company our size. So we think that makes sense. Similar to '19, in '19 we saw 6.3% organic in the first half, 8.3% organic the second half. And so we expect a similar trend in 2020. As I mentioned, you'll see second half acceleration as mentioned due to the product cadence and we can talk about the various products, if you'd like, as well as the M&A train organic. And also we expect hopefully, we aim for a resolution of the potential impact in China as we enter the second quarter.",1.0145234,0.836

We expect UroPH and Endo, as well as EP all to accelerate in 2020. We expect PI to put up a first quarter similar to fourth quarter. We expect nice acceleration due to important product launches in PI, as well as the integration going on plan. And we've also given the Structural Heart guidance $900 million to $1 billion, which is a significant increase over 2019. So we're very confident in the product launches that we have across all the divisions. And the execution, our aim will be to accelerate organic revenue growth in '20 faster than we did in '19.",0.7288956,0.946
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,81,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So we don't have all the market data yet. It's still too early to receive kind of unit volume across the industry. Similar to what I mentioned before, we think primarily the impact in Q4 was due to our comps. We had mid-single-digit positive comps. Our competitors had negative comps and so we don't see a -- we don't believe that we lost market share in defib in fourth quarter. We think we faced a tougher comp than our competitors did. And also we don't have the ICM loop recorder yet and some competitors include that in their sales. So in a pure like-for-like basis, we think we held share and we do think the market is a bit softer though. We think the market in 2020, we project global CRM to be flat to declining low single-digit. And we expect -- we obviously aim to continue to grow faster than the market, like, we have for many years in defib, but we think the market growth is probably zero to negative 2% for the full year.",0.8813918,0.064

So, again, we're very comfortable in the quarterly guidance we provided as well as the full year and we aim to accelerate in '20 over '19 organic growth, which I think is the most important piece here. We look at first quarter there is an extra what Dan calls a half day, when we look at all the global selling days and so forth. So there's a slight benefit there. But as mentioned in the script in a few areas, we do expect to see in first quarter Endo decelerate a little bit from first -- from fourth quarter, as well as PI being soft again in first quarter similar to fourth quarter. So those kind of are in line. And we also see some challenges in drug eluting stents with Japan price cuts, as well as the overall pricing environment in drug-eluting stents. So we anticipate that in the first quarter and we talked about the CRM market kind of zero to negative 2% range. But importantly, we have some nice mixed launches in DBS to support the full year and we expect to see continued complex coronary growth do well.",0.5824508,0.978
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,86,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then all the other businesses across the company should do extremely well with Structural Heart . But in first quarter the combination of some of those pricing pressures we're seeing in DBS combined with the Coronavirus issue that Dan outlined and really moving through that BTG integration that was the guidance of the 6 to 7.5 pre-Coronavirus and we estimate the impact, as I mentioned, 10 to 40 from China which brings our first quarter guidance down to 5 to 7.",1.4163389,0.024
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,88,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So Endo is one of our more predictable businesses, I would say, in the company. Very good execution against our plans. And it's not uncommon for them to have a slightly softer first quarter. So slightly soft is going to be above the BSC average and likely above market. So their definition of soft there is probably not fair. But as we see -- as we look at the full year, they have a nice set of product launches with new hemostasis clip, improvements to digital SpyGlass and the big one the Exalt-D. And we've had our first few cases take place over the past week and they want -- they're very, very encouraging.

So the 6% to 7.5% is the range without Coronavirus for Q1 in terms of organic revenue growth. Just to let you know how we got to the 5 to 7. So the low end of 5 is basically the midpoint of 6.75 and we took the high end of the risk of 10 to 40 for the Coronavirus and took that off to get to the 5. And then, saying, similarly for the high end of 7 it's the 7.5 high end less the low end of the Coronavirus of 10 million, which brings you to the 7%.

Dan I want to come back to Coronavirus just to sort of set expectations. So by our quick math, China is kind of 5% of the company. Maybe it was a point of growth to 2019. I appreciate the focus in the first quarter. But picking those numbers, it seems like you're implying for first quarter that China business is either a 10% grower kind of half what you grew last year 20% or maybe slightly declined. Is that kind of roughly accurate? And what's actually in the annual guidance for impact from China given it drove a point of growth from last year? Then I had a quick follow-up.",1.1897738,0.918
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,94,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, as we talked about at our Investor Day, China was about a $500 million business growing 20%. That would imply about a $600 million business in 2020. So rough math $50 million a month. The 10 and the 40 are simply the impacts our China team that's obviously very close to the issues in China on the ground. That's how they size it today and so that's why we included that in the Q1 guide. For the full year, as you saw, the 6.5 to 8.5, we assume that we can get some of those procedural volumes back and that other parts of the company could kick in and keep that 6.5% to 8.5% organic revenue growth range intact. But it's just the ability to react within Q1 with the acute nature of what we see as the potential in China that's why we raised it.",2.6698941,0.827

But just to hit on the biggest -- the bigger ones. The biggest growth driver contributor is going to be Structural Heart that $900 million to $1 billion. And the big impacts there are excited about led by WATCHMAN, with the new WATCHMAN FLX launch will happen in the US in the second half of the year and that's doing extremely well in Europe and we have a number of big clinical trials.

So you'll see a full year impact of LOTUS and we expect to see each quarter greater impact there. Our Symetis valve, ACURATE is doing well. It grew above the company average and grew about mid-teens in the fourth quarter and we expect to see neo2 launching in the second half. So the whole basket of Structural Heart will be big. EXALT will be a meaningful new incremental revenue driver with stronger second half impact. And then in PI, I would say, we're confident in quarterly improvements as we settled in on the BTG integration and you have new products being launched from legacy BTG, as well as potentially Ranger in the second half of 2020, which will put our position there. And EP, I mentioned, POLARx, you'll see a nice impact from that particularly in the second half of the year as we ramp that up.",0.6919818,0.966

So the teams have -- as you know this has been a multi-year program built off of the capabilities we've learned with LithoVue in digital SpyGlass. Those capabilities leveraged for Exalt-D and you hit the key criteria. The number one criteria, if this is to be a blockbuster product, which we think it will be -- it will -- to be -- have comparable, usability and functionality as existing scopes that require the sterilization expense of processes. And so that is the spec that the team has been focused on over the past three years or four years. And so the good news is, we've had done a number of procedures.

And so just like we've done with digital and with LithoVue, expect to see probably a once-a-year enhancements upgrade, if you will, to the platform. And so it's not as if this is a stagnant product and which sometimes you get with the reusables for many years. This is a product that we'll be able to enhance at least once per year throughout the next year period whether it be smaller handles, left-handed, right-handed, different user features that the competition doesn't have.

We do believe there's ample room in the existing reimbursement within patient at roughly $4,000 to $12 -- to $11,500 and outpatient $3000 to call it $5000. And we're also, as you know, we did receive FDA kind of the breakthrough status, which potentially could help with additional potential reimbursement tailwinds.

So on the Structural Heart piece, I think, that's fair that as you look at the LOTUS launch that's obviously a very controlled rollout that we've had and that should gain momentum over time as should Sentinel. Mike mentioned that neo2 comes out in the second half. So I think that's fair relative to Structural Heart. We obviously wouldn't give a specific number within the guidance range of 6.5% to 8.5% organic for the full year.

I want to make sure I include WATCHMAN FLX in the US as well, because that's a huge launch for the WATCHMAN team, who has done a fantastic job since inception. On the price impact, as I look at it, the summary would be, we just have a little bit more price across the enterprise this year in a couple of those areas, as we mentioned, the biannual Japan price cut and the China that will not allow the normal manufacturing cost improvements to poke their head above that and have gross margin go north.",0.6986553,0.896

This year the pricing is a little bit higher with China and Japan, and potentially some acceleration on the DES front there, as Mike mentioned. So that really just all netted out where margin -- gross margin should be in that approximately 72% range we set. That's not a surprise to us. It's what we've been saying all along for the last two years is that gross margin, which has paid a lot of the builds over the last five years or six years would slow in terms of its ability to contribute to operating margin improvement, and then SG&A and R&D would pick up that slack.

That business as we've mentioned is larger than DES and continues to do very well around the globe and it's really maybe our most important business in Asia-Pac. So that strategically is a very big business for us. It requires more clinical orientation, which is also helpful and more in our sweet spot and also it is under less pricing pressure, I would say, compared to drug-eluting stents. So the innovation there is really important. And you see a big focus on our Ivis and rural later platform, as well as WOLVERINE and maybe Ian can touch on some other key products.

We're hopeful that -- we aim for that business, I would say, to accelerate versus '19. If you look at '19 our SCS business was slow, the market was slow and we had extremely difficult comps the prior year. And so we would expect our global SCS business to improve over '19 and 2020. And also you heard at NANS, as well as detail out in some of the script, some of the clinical benefits we have with that portfolio. So, I think truly on a comp basis and expectations for the market to improve somewhat, we would expect that to improve. And in DBS we just have a lot of really good momentum there. Excellent share taking is taking place in Europe and in the US and you'll see some additional clinical studies being presented with that platform and we touched on some of the product differentiation there.

BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,123,Question,2020-02-05,4,2019,Josh Jennings,Cowen & Co.,"Hi, good morning. Thanks. And just two questions, first on China, I understand you provided nice details around the 1Q potential headwind. But can you help us get a little bit more granular? And any help just in terms of your exposure in China by business unit? I mean, its Cardiovascular Interventional Cardiology most exposed or is it more broad-based? And then on the second question just WATCHMAN FLX. Many comments today just on it being a driver. Can you help us understand the boost that you'll get from WATCHMAN FLX launch? Is that premium pricing are there accounts out there that are waiting for WATCHMAN FLX to get over the hump to start a WATCHMAN program or is it just deeper penetration to current accounts as WATCHMAN FLX will open up kind of more procedures in different risk categories of patients? Thanks for taking the questions.",0.1887709,0.962
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,124,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Josh. I can start on the first one, and I think, Mike, can take the second one. The good news is we do have, as you mentioned, a very well-diversified portfolio in our China business. It's not reliant on one particular business within the mix. But as our team reflects on all of what's going on there. It's pretty clear that a vast majority of the healthcare resources in China are focused on diagnosing, treating and preventing the spread of the Coronavirus and that all of the procedures are at risk of being delayed. So as we look at it, we don't say its particular division or another and that 10 to 40 contemplates the whole market basket of Boston Scientific business and the impact that we could see here in the first quarter.",0.533313,0.845
BSX-2019-Q4-2020-02-05,125,Answer,2020-02-05,4,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And on WATCHMAN FLX, Ian or Dr. Stein can comment on it as well. But I think in terms of what we've seen in Europe, it's been more of a share taking capability that we have in Europe. And in the US, we haven't seen centers not opening, because we don't have WATCHMAN FLX. So we don't think it's going to drive the sort of new center openings that we wouldn't already receive with current WATCHMAN. I think it's -- and they can speak to the safety profile and the confidence that physicians have with FLX, which will give them more confidence to continue to increase our utilization rates, which are -- so our key metric for WATCHMAN broadly is utilization rates. We'll continue to open more centers in the US. We're expanding in Japan. We're expanding in other countries. But in the US it's all about turning on and continue to ramp up utilization, which we're seeing or we believe WATCHMAN FLX will further enhance that.",0.6502269,0.952

BSX-2020-Q3-2020-10-28,134,Answer,2020-10-28,3,2020,Michael F.

We were 69.3% gross margin in the quarter. That included a 60 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN reserves. So we're in that 69% to 70% range.",0.1319213,-0.872

Yes, I think just overall, if you look at the overall execution for a number of years in a row. We've accelerated organic sales growth each year. Last year, we put up about 7.3%, and we - obviously, with the impact of COVID in 2020, and we've seen strong improvements each quarter.

You look at the growth of WATCHMAN. You look at the significant growth improvement across our businesses and really the diversification of our business. We've, for many years in a row, continue to reduce down the weighting of DES and CRM in our portfolio, given the growth trajectory of those markets and increase the weighting of our other businesses.

The M&A environment is a little bit challenging. I think you're probably referring to the IPO market.

Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Obviously, the upside on the other side of it is it's a nice financial gain, but that's not why we invest in these. We invested them obviously for the potential to acquire them. So it does seem to present a short-term challenge. We have over 40 companies in our VC portfolio. So there's a lot to choose from, and we'll see where that goes. And we have - as you know, we have the cash ready and available to be opportunistic relative to M&A in general.

BSX-2020-Q3-2020-10-28,149,Answer,2020-10-28,3,2020,Michael F.

We're very bullish on our Apama - sorry, on our cryoballoon in Europe. That will be in full launch mode in the fourth quarter, which should provide some significant growth in 2021. And we're very encouraged about the investment that we have in Veripos for IRE and that's an investment we made six years ago. And now we have an option to purchase that company.

I would say, overall, globally, it differs by region, by state. Some states in the U.S. have very normalized referral patterns and new patient funnels, some in the U.S., maybe down 10%.

I think if you were to net it all out, it's down. So we're not quite at normal new patient referral programs globally, and we're down.

So I don't bore you too much here. But on EXALT, we clearly lost, call it, four to six months, with EXALT-D with that launch.

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just I would say broadly, we had strong tailwinds and reimbursement in the third quarter. I won't get through off track. But with the new TPT with EXALT, it was a nice tailwind for that. So we looked at, for EXALT, to be a nice growth driver for us in 2021, we also have the surgical scope recently approved, and we're on track for a bronchoscope. So that's a multibillion-dollar opportunity.",1.1461422,0.947

So I think it really demonstrates the clinical efficacy of these platforms and the evidence to support the additional reimbursement.",1.3642965,0.727

Yes, we provided, I think as our - maybe our first quarter earnings call, the mix by business roughly of our inpatient versus outpatient. And that's really been very consistent in terms of the recovery during COVID. So, across our businesses, not surprising where we had a stronger outpatient orientation. You've seen a bit stronger recovery there with PI and urology, endo and neuromod. You saw neuromod, it was down like, what, 70%, 80% or some crazy number in the second quarter and came back dramatically in third quarter because of patient demand in that setting.",0.8977307,0.807
BSX-2020-Q3-2020-10-28,178,Answer,2020-10-28,3,2020,Michael F.

I mean, we don't see a scenario where the results of 2Q are matched again. So we don't see that happening.

So, thanks for all the detail this morning. Very much appreciated by us and investors. So, it's pretty clear, based on your internal budgeting, your forecasting, your growth in the fourth quarter, I wonder, Mike, if you can share with us, when you're thinking about from budgeting perspective about ""normalcy."" Can that incur in the first quarter of 2021, the first half of 2021?

It's really difficult to call that at this point in time. As you might expect, we have a number of different scenarios that we've laid out and we've looked at various triggers that we would pull to reduce cost or fuel investment faster. But our base case assumptions, really what we laid out here, which is the most significant decline in second quarter. Encouraging that we have seen an improvement recently in April, which gives us some optimism based on new centers opening up. And that sequential improvement, obviously, in the third quarter and a goal to get back to growth in the fourth quarter. But at this stage, I think it's probably premature to estimate whether there'll be kind of a surge beyond that.

Just as you think about pipeline procedures coming out of COVID, as hospitals resume procedures and I think about key drivers this year like cryo, ex-US EXALT or even LOTUS that is still sort of in a phased rollout, what do you sort of assume in terms of how hospitals or physicians approach certain new procedures? Do they focus on core procedures first? And how do you think that new procedures will be prioritized by physicians and the sales team as we come out of COVID? Thanks so much.",0.955998,0.838

We spent quite a bit of time trying to create this chart for you in the investor website on emergent, semi-emergent and elective. And clearly, you're seeing the results in April.

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think those emergent that we have laid out in this chart will occur most quickly. And in the semi-emergent and elective categories, we'll likely trail those. But I think importantly that we've laid out in our chart, two-thirds of our business is done in an outpatient setting, whether it be outpatient centers, OBL or a surgery center. So, that two-thirds is helpful for us because we believe those procedures will come back more quickly. So, thankfully, we have our portfolio that's more heavily weighted towards outpatients. And also, many of our procedures, also which is helpful, are actually profitable for hospitals.

Yeah, we're not concerned at all about the cost cutting and its ability to impact our competitiveness. We actually think it's smart. They're rational cuts, and our employees support it. So we have reduced down some of the inventory builds because we don't want to stack up too much inventory, which makes sense from a cash flow perspective, but we're very mindful of the need for surge capacity, so we ensure that we have ample supply which we're very comfortable with based on the tracking that we do and the agility of our operations teams. So, we're doing this with the mindset that we're going to have a stronger recovery as the months move on here in second quarter and third quarter and we're highly confident we have ample supply, which is the most important one.",0.8826406,0.976

We want to give you as much transparency as possible. We gave you the April results. We've seen some recent improvement and we're quite confident in the recovery path that we outlined with the improvement in third quarter and fourth quarter. And I think that's - also, what I mentioned with David's comment on the procedure mix that we have heavily weighted towards outpatient procedures is very helpful for us. And I think, most importantly, as procedure volumes get back, it's really about the portfolio that we have. And we have an impressive cadence of launches that we outline many of those across all of our businesses and we have a very robust pipeline. We're keeping the key R&D projects alive beyond this.

So, we're a little bit more highly leveraged than some of the peers. So, I think we took a little bit more of a decline based on that. I'm super proud of what the team did on the bank refinancing last week. I think we've answered that question, have ample liquidity, have things where we need on that front. So, I think that's hopefully been asked and answered and that was a little bit of a concern that folks had over the last quarter as well.",0.549511,0.901

Any company that's in the midst of ongoing clinical trials is going to see a similar timeframe delay. So, I think that's unfortunate.

So, we have some very large launches in 2020 with the WATCHMAN FLX, with the DCB balloon, with the POLARx product in EP, we've got a number of product launches in coronary, and like eight of them in PI.

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then, we've got a rich pipeline of other things, but it's, call it, a three to six-month delay likely based on the clinical timing. So, I don't think that'll be unique to Boston. The near-term pipeline is strong. We talked about pre-COVID growing faster than most of our peers, improving operating margins. And in terms of growing faster than peer group, that remains the goal and we aim to continue to deliver that once the recovery happens. And we have the pipeline to do that. So, the near-term pipeline looks very good and the clinical delays, I think you'll see across the board in the industry.",0.2378215,0.942

Before COVID, kind of pre mid-March, things were kind of going pretty nicely on the rail. So, obviously, we saw in Asia, particularly in China, we had the impact started in January. But for the US and EMEA and unaffected areas in Asia-Pac, things were going pretty nicely. So, the impact that you saw and the results that you see in Q1 is China and Asia-Pac impact across the full quarter, but really those last two weeks of March where we hit the brakes hard in US and EMEA. And those trends have kind of continued into April. As Mike said, we're seeing some signs of encouragement here recently in April and he gave you all the figures of what each business is down in April.

So, I'd say, clearly, the physicians have managing a pandemic on their mind every day. But without a doubt, physicians are very anxious to bring back their procedure volume. They know patients are waiting for it. They are encouraging to come back to hospital and you're seeing some hospitals open up. So, I think there's a great alignment in terms of hospitals' desire appropriately at the right time to bring back elective procedures and there's very high alignment by physicians wanting to do that. And some physicians and OBLs are talking about working six, seven days a week, multiple shifts to make up for that backlog. So, I think there's a lot of industry alignment with the motivations of the hospital and the physician community to bring that back.",0.2462935,0.938

So, TheraSphere is doing extremely well. Grew, I think, mid-teens in the quarter, taking share and is really not a procedure that can be deferred. So, the interventional oncology business broadly is doing well, really driven by TheraSphere. So, I'd say on the sales piece of it, and they also saw spec pharma do quite well. So, from a sales standpoint, the BTG portfolio has been more robust than legacy BSC, which is great news.",0.4269289,0.964
BSX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,147,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the integration, we got ahead of that pre-pandemic. So, we're very much on track with the cost synergies commitment that we've made, which is the summer. And most of that work had already been done and implemented pre-COVID pandemic. There's a few facility closures that we're working through that may be temporarily delay. But, overall, I would say the cost synergies are on track, if not ahead of track, and the integration of the commercial teams is really kind of taking place. I think that's all systems go. And then, we'll launch other deals - Vertiflex performed quite well pre-COVID.",0.4617247,0.401

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of capabilities, it's been a really interesting time and very proud of what we've seen. I would say the people are frustrated because they want to get out and see customers. And I think most people in this industry don't love social distancing, but we've learned a lot from it. I would say our global capabilities have accelerated. Many of our digital capabilities that maybe were isolated in certain regions or certain businesses have really accelerated in terms of global implementation. So, this period where people are working from home really has put a greater emphasis on our digital capabilities internally, our remote training capabilities with physicians, remote training internally and we're seeing a much - I would say an acceleration of those capabilities over the past 60 days, which quite frankly wouldn't have happened near that speed in a normal environment.",0.5319213,0.867

I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. But you had a nice download in terms of what you experienced in China in January, February, March and now April.

It actually had some positive growth in Japan. There has been a little bit of impact thus far in April, but not to the same levels that we've seen in Western Europe or US. And so, we do expect Japan will likely soften a bit more than it did in the first quarter. But their handling of the crisis has been pretty efficient.",0.2632375,0.81

And just a follow-up, just with the recovery in the fourth quarter, those expectations, are you baking in any assumptions around the potential seasonal second wave?

So, we won't go through our eight scenarios we have for the remainder of the year, which I think is important to have for any company and actions we would take depending on those scenarios, either positive, upside or potentially softening. And so, the base case that we believe is what we outlined. If there was an issue where there's additional second waves, they likely potentially could be a little bit smaller impact based on the readiness that our facilities have and hospitals have. And we also would have the cost levers to pull in case that we see that. So, we don't discount that additional waves may happen. We don't think it would be nearly the same impact that we saw second half of March or April, but we continue to look at counter measures be put in place in those cases.",0.288351,0.586

We don't believe that we're losing share in CRM. We're likely holding share. We have lost a little bit of share in pacemakers. We just launched a new lead in pacemakers, which will help in that business, maybe easier comps, although the comps are kind of all messed up now. So, I would say, in pacemaker business, we have lost a little bit of share. And ICD, we believe that we've continued the hold share. The prior years, we've gained share a number of years in a row in ICD and CRT-D, but we believe we're maintaining share.",0.3972769,0.846

The capabilities of HeartLogic will show through in the pandemic, ability to manage the patients remotely and get a view of their heart diagnostics proactively is a beneficial feature to have during a pandemic.

That supply issues will be back to full supply, call it in mid June. So that will be strong for the second half of the year.

I think 2019 guidance is pretty consistent with our view. It's a second quarter, a lot of conversation this morning on second half, but if you think about the second quarter, how risk adjusted is the second quarter and you know what factors sort of provide the confidence given Eluvia and mesh get a little worse in the second quarter pretty significant momentum step up just into 2Q. So one, what is your confidence in second quarter? What are factors that drive that? And in 2019 guidance, broadly is the reflection or the reduction simply Eluvia and mesh or does it also reflect kind of a slower start to the year and then I have a quick follow-up?",0.3780728,0.928

With respect to the organic growth profile you laid out in the acceleration that you are anticipating through the end of the year, the tenants of that premise seems like they would continue into the first half of next year. And I can appreciate that you are not ready to give guidance for next year yet. But as we digest that, coupled with the metrics you laid out with respect to BTG, I assume your expectations for the organic growth that BTG will generate haven't changed given their strong results recently. So it seems like it's setting up that this could accelerate further in the first half of next year, what I'm getting at is as we look at a forward 15 to 18 months. Can you give us any color or you willing to give us any color as it related to just beyond the end of this year where it seems like it could accelerate further.",1.9637733,0.974

It was a bit softer than we anticipated in the first quarter, this traditionally been a strong double-digit growth market, and we believe that will be the case although first quarter was a bit softer.

BSX-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,75,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And so the way I think of it is, you look at Q1 and that was 3%, right? You look at Q2, and at the midpoint, that's 4.5%. So that's a nice acceleration. You heard Mike talk about the recovery and we look for that recovery to continue in Q2. So the midpoint is that 4.5%. And then if you look at the full-year range of 2% to 5% and you take the high-end of 5%, that implies that we're north of 6% in both of Q3 and Q4.",0.5883252,0.61

In Europe, overall, very pleased with the team's performance, grew 2% in the quarter versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019. That's really despite some of the lockdowns that you've seen. So in some markets like the UK, the business has been stronger. The business has picked up in Germany. Some countries like Italy and Spain have been a bit softer.

Yes, I think it's probably pretty consistent with what you've heard from other companies that are in our sector. January looked a lot like December, right?

I think the updated EPS guidance - one, just remind us, that does not include Lumenis, correct? I think we were expecting a couple of hundred million of revenues and some EPS accretion.

So the Lumenis acquisition is excluded from guidance, that has not closed. So you are correct that's excluded. And the way - we obviously think of operating margin at the bottom line with all the individual components of gross margin and SG&A and R&D. But specific to gross margin, we wanted to be approaching 70% in Q1, we ended up, as I said, slightly short of that because of inventory charges and some lower sales in some of the higher margin businesses. Obviously, you look at neuromod, has one of the best gross margins of our businesses and that was the most impacted by COVID.",1.3481051,0.739
BSX-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,121,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So confident that as we go into Q2, we'll get back to that approaching 70%.

BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,65,Question,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"That's on the strong quarter and congrats to Lauren. So, first question for Mike and Dan is, just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your back half 2021 assumptions. You mentioned that you assume a manageable level of COVID. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what that means. Does that mean specifically that you assume things get a little worse from what you're seeing today? Or do you assume things stay about the same?",0.2729218,0.831
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,66,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I think if you look at the numbers, Bob, and I think a lot of it has to do with the comps, right? If you look at our comps from 2019 quarter-by-quarter, they're 6697. And so we put up effectively a 9 in Q2 versus a 6 in 2019. If you look at our guidance for Q3, it's 5% to 7%. So take the midpoint at 6, that's against the comp of a 6, which is the 9 which is 300 basis points harder. So in theory, the 6 effectively becomes a 9 when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think what you're hearing I say is that, Q2, that the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply is that for the most part continues in the back half. So manageable COVID impact would be a quarter similar to what you saw in Q2.",0.1797066,0.521

And then the just a quick follow-up question is, so I think if you could talk just a little bit more about WATCHMAN trends in the quarter. It sound like things went really well. But just curious if you maybe could provide a growth rate over 2019? Just curious for kind of flushing out the experience with WATCHMAN in the quarter a little bit more. And if you can quantify it at all, that'd be helpful. Thank you.",0.3149773,0.978
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,72,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sure. Yes, we won't be providing a growth rate on '19. But overall, the plans with WATCHMAN FLX have gone exceedingly well. As we mentioned, the U.S has really been fully converted at this point, which happened ahead of schedule and we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule. But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of FLX, the utilization of WATCHMAN reflects in the U.S accounts, in particular it continues to increase. So we do have some small, new incremental account openings. But far and away the bulk of the growth in U.S has been driven by increasing position utilization and penetration rates. And we've recently have some approval in Japan as we are starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which we'll get more so in second half as well as in 2022. But it's really being driven by the utilization rates, the safety profile, physician comfort with the device and training new physicians at the existing facility. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN and new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base, the physician community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we've pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. And we continue to expect to do well in that, but it's an exciting platform for us.",0.1446293,0.765
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,75,Question,2021-07-27,2,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. I'll add my congratulations on a really nice quarter. Two from me. First, it looks like you had great growth in the U.S with 12% organic over 2019. I was wondering, maybe you could just give us an overview of where you're seeing the recovery. Are you seeing any lagging trends from delta variant, and is there any discrepancy in inpatient versus outpatient? You're one of the first to report here with such a global covering and diverse offering, I think it'd be really and structural as we think about the rest of the year and the guidance?",0.3346445,0.993
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,76,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so just broadly, we saw terrific results in the U.S., very strong results in Europe despite the lockdowns in Europe, and it was nice to see. More COVID impact in Europe. That business grew 9% organic, and we had the most significant COVID impacts in Asia, in ASEAN countries and Japan, in particular, with Korea, Australia, doing well as was China. So we saw more COVID impact broadly in Asia-Pac, and the strong recovery in the U.S. And then in terms of the U.S., for your question there, we really -- with the exception of EP, we think every business globally and the U.S grew double-digit organically versus '19 and likely gain share in their respective markets with the exception of potentially EP and CRM. But EP grew share international markets. And in the -- if you break down -- if you look at Uro and Endo, particularly -- and also PI, where we have a more substantial ASC business and outpatient business, you saw 15% to 16% growth in Uro, 15% in Endo and 10% organic in PI with strong growth from TheraSphere. So, I would say in the U.S., we saw a nice rebound both in the hospital setting, which I think has been verified by many of the public company hospital change reporting prior to us, and we saw strong growth in the outpatient ASC center as well.",1.0039334,0.96
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,77,Question,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Great. And maybe a follow-up for Dan and a suggestion. Dan, I think some of us had a little trouble hearing the Nuance guidance you gave, if you guys want to send out your prepared remarks. I think that'd be really helpful for all the investors. But maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned higher input costs and COGS. So improving in second half versus first half, but maybe not all the way quite up to 2019. How are you thinking about the company's ability to absorb and pass on some of those costs? And do you think that's going to be an issue going into 2022 as we exit the year here, because you did have great expense control down the P&L? Just thinking about the cost component. Thanks.",0.8636919,0.972
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,78,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Relative to gross margin, so we averaged 69.8 in the first half. And I think we feel comfortable that we'll improve upon that here in the second half of '21. Specific to what's going on in gross margin, we will have the tailwind of the COVID related variances that we put on the balance sheet during 2020, those are amortized over your inventory turns. And so effectively as of 630 this year, the end of Q2, those are gone. So that's good news. We do still have some COVID specific lingering costs of running plants in a COVID environment. So COVID is not completely done, obviously, as you know. And so we do have those and those are adding cost. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us, we do have some pockets of inflation and particularly with freight where we just need more commercial airliners to be flying than are flying today. We have wage pressure in certain locations, and then direct materials particularly, precious metals and things like that we are seeing inflation there. So we do have some headwinds. But overall, as we look at the back half of '21, we would assume we would improve versus that 69.8 average in the first half. And then, as it relates to '22 and beyond, I would envision we will give you a more detailed review of that at an Investor Day on the 22nd of September.",1.0388142,0.866

Will get the number in the past in terms of the Lumenis net number. So we will -- let's circle back on that one. But the timing just strategically makes perfect sense. I think that the group is aware of this. We had distribution agreement Lumenis in the U.S., distribution agreement in China, which was effective, therefore we weren't getting the same level of gross margin benefits that we wanted nor could we innovate on the platform. And I guess tie it more comprehensively into our StoneSmart platform. So by owning that we obviously improve our gross margins. We can drive a more robust product roadmap within our StoneSmart ecosystem. And then we can expand our direct coverage in Europe, and especially in China, we have a very big business. So that makes sense. And what do we say here, Lauren?",0.2039334,-0.422

One on a high level. If I just look at the 2Q performance in the back half implied guide, we did 9% in Q2 versus pre-pandemic 2019. Back half implied is 7% and 9%. I mean, we're already running, if I look at the 2Q to 4Q of performance, we're already running well north of 8%, Preventice, Lumenis, once these deals become organic, they should be incremental, plus you have these pipelines. I guess that when I look at that LRP of 6% to 8%, shouldn't these results provide a high degree of confidence in upper end of that LRP on the top line going forward?",0.9477384,0.823

Obviously, we'll, as Mike said, probably tee that up for an Investor Day conversation relative to the portfolio and the overall results. So I don't think it would serve us well to comment relative to the specifics in there. But the strength of the portfolio in the pipeline is what's given us the confidence to put up the numbers that we put up in the past and obviously, looking forward, give us the confidence in the revenue growth trajectory for the future. So -- but specific to where in the range, I don't think I'll go there.",1.0684597,-0.536
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,97,Question,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Understood, Dan. Just one on margins maybe. When should gross margins get back to pre-pandemic levels or perhaps an operating margins, just given the commentary around freight in inflationary pressures? Should point to operating margins be at 2019 levels?",1.3643032,0.698
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,98,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, I mean, if you think of the back half of this year, that's what we're calling for Vijay. So we're calling for an average in the back half of '21 to be at our full year 2019 level, which was call it rounded 26%. So the goal is to do that in the back half of '21 and set us up for '22 and beyond. Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8 in the first half. It'll be improving on that in the second half. So when does that get back to specific 2019 levels, we'll -- again, we'll give more details in Investor Day. But if you think of at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again, over history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago, gross margin was growing very nicely, and as a percentage of sales. And we were investing in places like the emerging markets and other areas. So SG&A was in sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sales, but still delivered very solid operating margin progression through that timeframe. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward, maybe gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bills so to speak. But SG&A potentially with lower travel spend and other trade-offs that will make in addition to more efficient R&D spend. The goal is always to have operating margins increase year-over-year and I think our track record speaks for itself on that.",1.025978,0.44

BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,103,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. We haven't had all the competitors report in that field. So we're not exactly sure how we grew versus the competitive set, but we had a strong acceleration in 2Q. U.S -- overall in the quarter. And I think part of it is a combination of the unique portfolio that we have with the new launches. The new fast algorithms, and I detailed in the script that may have had a difficult hearing. We're going to send them out to people. But combination of the new fast algorithms as well as the clinical work that we're doing, so SCS overall improved versus first quarter. And then it was augmented, as you mentioned, with Vertiflex growth in the quarter as well as continued growth in our RF portfolio. The RF portfolio although a bit smaller continues to exceed expectations. And then the other really big growth driver for neuromod in the quarter was our Deep Brain Stimulation business. And it's really impressive what that group has done. They continue to gain market share. Really the number one de novo player in Europe, and close to that now in the U.S., and they continue to accelerate market share gains through the innovation of that business. So the DBS probably had the largest snapback of any business in the second quarter with a COVID impact win in the U.S. But overall, the SCS market and the pain side did quite well as well.

The overall Uro business had a big bounce back in the quarter growing 16%. And the big things that we're focusing on with the resume is we're continuing to drive improved reimbursement rates, with some of the specific payers which is helping. But it's also the long-term durability data and that's giving physicians more confidence in the product that's driving the growth. And we've also expanding our international footprint with resume, particularly in Europe, and also some additional DTP, direct-to-patient and direct-to-physician, marketing campaigns to drive more awareness.

And then in the second half of '21, you'll see enhancements in next release, or next-generation release, if you will, of EXALT D to further improve the platform. So we expect to see continued momentum with that. The big news for us is the recent approval of EXALT D and some sites that tried it for the first time in Europe. And we're really bullish on that platform, let's say, an established market with a few competitors, but we think we have some differentiated capabilities with EXALT D. And so in second half of '21, and much more so in '22, you'll see the impact of that platform as well. So it's all going to plan, but we're seeing some improved momentum with EXALT D in the U.S as COVID is improving.",0.4299546,0.44

BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,120,Question,2021-07-27,2,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Excellent. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. It looks to us like when we compared the delivery versus consensus, there's two areas that might be lagging a little bit or EP and CRM. But I also remember that there are a number of key products in those sections. Can you highlight one or two that might bring you back into sort of the market taker or gain position?",0.0066566,0.994
BSX-2021-Q2-2021-07-27,121,Answer,2021-07-27,2,2021,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Well, you nailed it. We take each every one of our businesses with exception, while EP grew double digits versus '19, but likely globally that's below market. And CRM, we think we're a little bit below market. With the exception of those two, we think every other one grew faster than markets. And EP, I think you'll see a similar trend likely for the next couple of years. And that we expect our EP results in the international markets to exceed market growth, which we think they did in second quarter. On the heels of our cryo platform, where with this -- now the only competitor to the established player in cryo and we're taking share there. And then our stable point, which is our forceps and catheters approved in Europe. And as previous question we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter, and their commercial in Europe. So the three distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform with Farapulse. Upon closure, our cryo and STABLEPOINT in Europe. And we also expect to see benefit of cryo in Japan towards the second -- towards the end of '21 and full year '22. So our international business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business in EP will grow faster the market. And our U.S business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products are in clinical trial right now. And thankfully, as COVID improved, the clinical trial run rates of those platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP. Really strong outside the U.S., less so in the U.S likely for the coming earnings calls. And CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to lag a bit in S-ICD -- in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead that is being implanted now across in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter S-ICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM.",0.0066566,0.422

The growth profile we see in this enthusiasm. I would say within PI, the BTG acquisition has gone -- exceeded expectations and the TheraSphere segment within particular in Varithena doing extremely well. Then if you give me a third one, there's lots of different areas to speak to, I think -- yes, I think just overall in the -- I know its super early. We're very bullish on the combination of cryo and Farapulse. Although not in the U.S yet, that market is so large and the growth profile of EP is so good. That will be the only company that will have IRE and cryo and force-sensing. So all those smaller dollars now exciting opportunity for us.",0.1295008,0.361

I appreciate some of the longer term comments you gave on operating margins. Just curious what the base we should be using for that 50% or 50 basis points of margin expansion for year, if we should think about that 26% in the back half here.

But for '21, I think the reasonable basis as a starting point would be that 26%, that's we're kind of resetting to here in the back half.

And then I just wanted to make sure the message was clear on the full year guidance and the guidance raise. So you're going from 2% to 5% for the full year versus 2019 to 6% to 7%.

Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"No, I think if you go back to the original guidance back in February, and for the most part reiterated in April, it was COVID impact in Q1, less COVID impact in Q2, and then a more of -- return to more normalized procedure of volumes in Q3 and Q4. I think we got a little bit of that early as our results would point to versus our guidance ranges for Q2. And then if you take what we were saying about the back half, which we say is the same type of COVID impact and pretty much the same type of results in Q3 and Q4 as in Q2.

I think this is one of the issues that, with a delayed integration, that business has slowed a bit. Actually, in the third quarter, the number came in much better than we were expecting. So, has there been sort of stabilization in recovery in BTG in the early days of integration?",1.6032448,0.318
BSX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,114,Question,2019-10-23,3,2019,David Lewis,Thomas Weisel Partners,"And recent events, Jeff has sort of talked about the ability of taking that business to sort of 50-50 global mix over the next several years. Just maybe, Mike, your recent trends in BTG and sort of your just confidence in getting that 50-50 global mix implies some pretty dramatic growth dynamics for BTG over the next two to three years. You're confident that kind of global mix is achievable here in the near term or in the intermediate term?",1.4552606,0.952

So, just on BTG overall, very excited to finally get this closed. It did take three or four months longer than we planned. We did have some commercial turnover during that period which the team, now that it has closed, is shoring that up and really beeping up the resources on the commercial side.",0.2166415,0.42

Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And based on really just early feedback from physicians, the combined portfolio in interventional is really kind of we laid out.

BSX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,118,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the portfolio fix is really kind of a dream for the commercial team. And based on that, we do feel comfortable that BTG will grow faster than the BSC composite in 2020 and beyond and be nicely accretive to the PI business.

Clearly, we're not going to give 2020 guidance at this point. I just think there's a lot of very positive things going on in the company. You look at the momentum that we have really across each business. With the exception EP, each business we believe grew nicely above market and we have very strong momentum across each region. Emerging markets growing at nearly 20%. Very strong above-market growth in Europe which is impressive given that most of our products get approved in Europe prior to get in the US and very strong growth in the US.",1.1458396,0.989
BSX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,125,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And importantly, since you said high level, each quarter, we continue to shift our mix of businesses into faster growth markets as we've outlined that numerous times in various calls. So, each quarter, that profile in terms of our growth potential gets stronger and the team continues to grow above market while investing for the long term. And we have many exciting product launches in 2020, with the Exalt scope which we think will be a really unique platform for us for many years, across our structural heart portfolio where the Watchman FLX would be approved, ideally the ACURATE neo2 in the second half and very a strong product cadence.",1.0251135,0.966

BSX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,127,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we have many different, I would say, tailwinds to offset some of these, I would say, overblown headwinds which were ischemia, the ACURATE SCOPE I as well as the BTG. We're very confident in ACURATE for the long term. We're very confident in BTG. And our DES business, although not a key growth driver, is an important contributor.",0.5782148,0.827
BSX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,128,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Michael F. Mahoney,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think, overall, we are excited about the future. I think if you look at our Investor Day deck, we talked about its acceleration. So, despite some of these headwinds in 2019, we expect to grow organically faster than we did in 2018, and that would clearly be our goal for 2020. And at our Investor Day, we talked about organic acceleration in 2020, 2021 and 2022 versus the previous three years.

So, in cardio, the value of complex coronary is probably understated across the company. It may be our most important platform in Asia-Pac. Our complex coronary business is growing much faster than BSC composite. We continue to invest quite a bit in new portfolio there. And that business is really quite a bit larger than our DES business. And so, again, that was a purpose strategy from Kevin Ballinger, Lance Bates and the team over the year. So, I think complex coronary will continue to be very bright as it gets significantly larger than DES. And also, positions us more uniquely in cath lab clinically with doctors.",0.9618759,0.862

Watchman continues to accelerate growth, continues to deliver strong outcomes, improve utilization and we're very excited about the FLX progress that we're seeing in Europe and our ability to take share in that market with that second gen product and that coming to the US.

We're very excited where we're with Lotus. I do not think there is a - we have seen a tremendous change in terms of the market growth, but the outcomes with Lotus have been very favorable.

I think as you look at 2020, we'll obviously give you a lot more color as we give guidance here at our next call. But, obviously, the $175 million in overall synergies, as Mike said, we're committed to that over that three-year timeframe. And the BTG operating margin will continue to improve where it will be - the interventional medicines piece will be approaching PI and then eclipsing PI and eclipsing the overall for Boston Scientific. So, it would start to be accretive to Boston Scientific overall. And we'll give you more on the timing on that when we talk about 2020 and specifics.",0.8817237,0.735

As I mentioned in the script, really the highlight there for that was our deep brain stimulation platform, Vercise, which is doing extremely well globally, taking quite a bit of share and really doubling the sales year-over-year.

So, we essentially have diversified our capabilities there in both SCS, Vertiflex as well as RF. And our Vertiflex acquisition is really exceeding our deal model and we're really the best company to provide that continuum of care for RF lumbar stenosis with Vertiflex or SCS. So, I think that positions us more uniquely versus our peers in terms of that full portfolio to address that. We're seeing great results out of Vertiflex, great results out of RF.",0.8635401,0.952

So, it's a positive trend, but clearly not to the market levels that we enjoyed in the past.

So, I think, overall, the marketplace still is clearly not to the levels that it was in 2018 and historical. Potentially, low negative single digits. But we believe we continue to grow above market in SCS and we're really buoyed and enhanced by the depth of the portfolio with Vertiflex, RF and our DBS platform, which is really kind of in line with our category leadership strategy.

And we think we're uniquely capable of delivery in this based on our results and expertise that we've created with both LithoVue in urology and digital SpyGlass in endo.

It's the diversification of the portfolio.

Ian mentioned the patient population. But as importantly, the portfolio investments that we've made have driven complex coronary to be very important businesses there. And then, you see the diversification of endo, amazing growth with PI, particularly in Asia, great growth of our interventional oncology business and we're starting to see the impact really just the diversification of BSE other than drug-eluting stents.

The reimbursement in the other three categories is actually slightly improved. And so I think we have the nice flexibility to move patients seamlessly across that continuum of diagnostics. The reimbursements improved in some areas. There is obviously a headwind with long term Holter, and I think there will be quite a few discussions on that aspect in the future.

So if you look at the 0% to down 6%, the mid-point of that is down 3%. We were down 4% in Q4, we were down 3% in Q3.

BSX-2020-Q4-2021-02-03,141,Answer,2021-02-03,4,2020,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So in terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 will be dilutive to 2019. Q2 improves and then I think the key point is that in what is - could largely be characterized as a post-COVID world when we get to the second half of 2021, that will be at or exceeding the full year operating margin of 26.1% in the second half.

BSX-2020-Q4-2021-02-03,142,Answer,2021-02-03,4,2020,Daniel J. Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And the key really is gross margin in the short term. It's interesting, if you go back and you take a look at 2020 and you adjust out LOTUS and WATCHMAN and then the abnormal variances we talked a lot about in Q2 from the lower production volumes, you kind of get a gross margin that's around 70% each of those quarters.",3.8988386,-0.494

I mean, the $400 million number, I wonder if you can provide some context around that.

Dan, you - tax rate came in a little lower than we thought. Could you just to talk us, what drives the low end and high end of the earnings range? I think we initially thought 50 basis points of leverage this year. Maybe with the - you've got more flexibility now with the lower tax rate. So how are you thinking about leverage in 2018? And from balance sheet perspective, I think a lot of investors are interested on, like, what you think your capacity is towards the back half of this year? Is it $750 million? Is it $1 billion?

So on the tax rate, in early January we had talked about the 16%. That was the best read at that time. And frankly, now that we've had more time to crawl through it and there's been more clarity, we think the 14% to 15% from an operational rate perspective is a good call for 2018. And then, keep in mind the all-in tax rate is 100 basis points lower than that, just given the ASU on stock comp.

We think that sets us up well to get to that 28% by 2020. The - really, the only one that's a bit stuck on that is the gross margin, and that's just the FX impact that we'll see in 2018 and that hopefully turns to a tailwind in 2019 and 2020. So I think, all tends to line up well in terms of very solid leverage in 2018 and then probably acceleration of that leverage in 2019 and 2020.",0.0382029,0.572

Balance sheet is probably as healthy it's been in 10-plus years when you look at it relative to our capacity and our debt and leverage ratios. So we're down in the low-tows now. We sit very well with that.

One is, we had to finish the mesh pay down and tax, which we're doing this year. And then, we'll really have much more freedom as you look at second half of 2018 and then going forward once those are retired. We do have a pretty active M&A appetite.

Brennan,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So to be clear, this year we expect 110 basis points of headwind in FX, related to gross margin. When you get to 2019 and 2020, if the rates were to hold where they are today, it becomes a much better story, where it's neutral to slightly favorable for us, both at the gross margin line and then at the FX line as well. So 2019 and 2020 is a much better FX story than it has been for the last three-plus years.",0.1977384,0.748
