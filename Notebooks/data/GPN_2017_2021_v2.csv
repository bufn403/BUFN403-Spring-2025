So first, as it relates to distribution, you asked about smaller bank.

So debit will also be an area that we're focused. On coming out of it, we do have a significant debit business at TSYS, primarily outside of the United States.

Well, I would say in answer to your question, we reaffirmed today, really all of our expense targets, including the COVID-19 specific cost controls. So as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks, there's a fair amount of uncertainty for the remainder of the year, given the pandemic and the macroeconomic outlook globally. And I think until we get some more certainty about where the world is heading, the duration of the pandemic and the depth of it, it's very hard for us to do than what we did this morning, which is reaffirm where we're, you know, where we're headed.",0.0281139,0.691

So the first thing I'd say and we said this in our prepared remarks, is that our performance given our mix in all our businesses, especially given our mix was better than what you saw from networks last week, hands down. I mean, that's just a fact.

To Jeff point, Ashwin, I think the overall health of the customer base that we have today is really quite good, notwithstanding the environment that we operate in today. And from a performance standpoint, the Merchant business performed pretty consistently with what you saw on the network's, putting aside the overall company performance as Jeff highlighted, which was clearly better as a revenue and net income and EPS matter.",1.1811955,0.954
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,111,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So I think as we look at the portfolio today, because we are SMB-focused that has not disproportionately impacted us on the negative sense, relative to what you've seen coming out of the network's. And, you know, frankly, we were also very successful in supporting our customers throughout this difficult period, with various concessions that we made, offerings of new product for free for a period of time.

But I would just point out that a lot of our businesses are overseas. Not everybody, not every market has PPP, or anything like it. So there's plenty of examples. I think Cameron and Paul alluded to this in our commentary, where we're net growing year-over-year in markets that didn't like PPP or consumer disbursement.",0.144484,0.818
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,114,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So while 70% of our business, of course, is right here in the United States, in the merchant side, a healthy 30% of it, or a $1.5 billion is not.

I want to ask on the AWS, just this question of, is this offensive or a defensive move from Global Payments? Is this more about winning new modern card issuing contracts or about migrating the existing? And maybe if you could share the cost to stand up the technology, I'm just guessing here, are you going to run an instance of TS2 inside AWS in parallel with your existing solution for some time?

I'll start and then Paul is going to provide some of the financial commentary. But listen, I think it's offensive. I think at the end of the day, the way we look at the world is this is based on overwhelming feedback from our partners and customers today, in financial services that what they would like to see from us over the next number of years.",0.53879,0.25

We're looking at where to see if technology needs to be a number of years, a number of years down the road. So it is going to take us a few years to put this technology on into effect.

But in all fairness, TSYS was doing this for quite some time prior to the merger with Global Payments in September of 2019.

So as I said in our prepared remarks, today and historically, TSYS is very much confined to environments where TSYS can build a physical data center to host the information that needs to be hosted, with card issuers, particularly the larger card issuers, that's no longer going to be constrained in the context of AWS, if their physical, but also of course, their virtual size.",0.3854093,-0.052
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,124,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The second thing is historically, you really needed a cloud-native, end-to-end environment to pitch kind of neobanks. Neobanks and new entrants in the financial services space, this will get us there. And third, as I mentioned before from a collaboration point of view, its really unique to AWS and us being we're supporting the entire lifecycle of pitching and selling all the way through to billing, so dramatically expands the sales resources that we would always have at the fingertips of TSYS and Global Payments. So from that point of view, I think pretty, really offensive. Paul, do you want to comment on the financial?",0.1213523,0.584

Tien-Tsin, on your question around the cost, no, this will be managed in our overall cost base of the Issuer Solution segment. As Jeff mentioned, obviously, we've been doing some of this for several years now. And so, you know, we do not see an uptick in costs, or really from a CapEx standpoint, this will be managed in our overall CapEx budget at this kind of normalized levels.",0.9571006,0.318

Just a quick follow-up, just on the relationship side, is sounds like the bookings, especially in restaurant.

As you can imagine, throughout the course of the pandemic, with the vast majority of our resources around the globe and our team members working from home, ever in a remote environment.

But our teams have performed admirably. And the thing that I'm struck by every time I get on a call with one of our product teams, with the business is the level of collaboration and how quickly the TSYS and Global Payments teams have come together and how effective we've been in introducing new product and new capability in a very short period of time.",0.0595414,0.637

It's not without a lot of effort, as you can imagine, and I appreciate you highlighting that.

GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,138,Question,2020-08-03,2,2020,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Good morning, Jeff, Cameron and Paul. Would be curious for your perspectives on the rollout of QR codes by a number of the pure-play online payment companies, and how does this interact with GPN, where you have the relationship at the physical point of sale, is there just a sharing of economics or is there an incremental sort of, you know, economic fee work QR code is being used?",0.5211184,0.869
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,139,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah, David. Its Jeff. So what I would say is we probably have as much experience as anybody at QR code acceptance. We enable more, as we said in our remarks, we enable more NFC acceptance, and we enable in more markets than really anybody else, with extensive partnerships with Alipay, WeChat Pay. Those have obviously moved outside Asia into North America and into Europe. So I would say relative to QR codes, we welcome more of those in more of our markets because of our record of doing that across Asia, North America and Europe.",0.041637,0.622
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,140,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The second thing I would say is, if you go back to the Issuer side of the equation with AWS, this is going to enable us as well many things, this will enable us to move even more quickly on new means of adoption, for, you know, for payments. So I think by making it our entire environment, from a transformative point of view, cloud-native and cloud-enabled, that's only going to facilitate the faster rollout, as you've seen with us already in terms of contactless, in terms of our extended announcement this morning with Mastercard for virtual cards. That only make us I think, more helpful in terms of rolling out products like QR more directly.",2.3992883,0.771
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,141,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The last thing I'd say in response to your question of economics is, when you think about QR codes, there's a variety of ways to load those. So depending on who you're talking, if it's PayPal, it's generally via card, all those obviously also debit. In ACH, although card is the majority, I believe of how PayPal loads occur today.",0.4174377,0.0
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,142,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"If you look in Asia, what you'd see is ACH via bank loads through Ali. But you know, at the end of day, the merchant wants to accept whatever payment scheme the cardholder and the consumer is presenting. So they're generally not to the exclusion, meaning, we have QR codes in place, it doesn't mean that the merchant at the end of the day is going to say, don't give me some other card, or I care about how you loaded cards in the in the first place.",0.280427,0.771
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,143,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So from that point of view of our economic opportunity, really doesn't differ among the different types. And I will tell you, at the end of the day, really the only enemy here is cash. So the more cash and cheque that we get out of the point of sale, the more we move towards safer commerce, which includes QR codes, the better for Global Payments at the end of day. So innovation, pace of change, multi-nationalization of payment types, this is nothing but good news for our business.",0.5544484,0.053

Just a quick follow up, just to go to market approach in Europe, you know, both with the issuer solution side and merchant, you know, plus layering in AWS now, how do you size the market opportunity in Europe, historically, the big banks have been more in house across a range of merchants and, you know, as your solutions, you see that opportunity opening up now from a new business standpoint?",0.9015467,0.915
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,146,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"First, on the Issuer side, we have fantastic opportunities globally, including in Europe, with TSYS on the Issuer side and Global Payments on the Merchant side. So we've made tremendous headway there in the nine months since we announced the closing of our merger, I'm as optimistic today as I ever have been on completing a number of issuer deals with TSYS with global relationships worldwide, but including in particular lighter comment in Europe.",0.7758007,0.599
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,147,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And that, of course, was before AWS. So the way we talk about TSYS and Global Payments is that on a combined basis we have 1300 FI customers around the world, I will tell you financial services, is a very big piece of AWS's footprint today, and obviously, it's a very large business. We've certainly thought about our ability to bring AWS into the fold as it relates to our conversations with our current customers. And I believe that they're doing the same with us on the issuer side. So that's only going to expand that pool of opportunities from the 1300 that we have today at legacy Global Payments and TSYS.",0.7024911,0.823
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,148,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And then the merchant side, I think you should look at the Caixa announcement as a harbinger of other things that may come. We've seen this with Erste in Continental Europe with us a number of years ago. We've obviously seen the Caixa in 2010. But the expansion today, I think the reasons that drives financial institutions today to do that relate to the ECBs point of view on what impact COVID-19 and the pandemic may have on the macroeconomic environment and the balance sheet health and capital ratios of those companies.",0.2928826,0.077
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,149,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So David, it's never a bad time to do something with us. But I would say this reminds me a lot of what we saw in '09, '10 or '11, which is we'll go through a macro economic dislocation. And that provides a fantastic opportunity for us to do more and we've been able to do. So I think, stay tuned and more to come. And I'm pretty optimistic about the health of our business in Europe.",0.419573,0.938

Its Cameron, I'll start off and ask Jeff and Paul to jump in if they have any additional comments. So, look, I would say across the board in Merchant, we've been pretty pleased with how the business has performed throughout the pandemic. Obviously, and we call this out specifically in the script, and Jeff commented on it earlier, our Integrated business performed extraordinarily well, I would say throughout the pandemic. A lot of that is due to the strength of our partnerships in that channel, our focus on consumer non-discretionary channels by and large. But the overall performance in that business clearly led the pack, as it relates to our overall Merchant business in the second quarter, and obviously, that has continued in July and we expect to see that continue through the balance of the year as well.",0.6989415,0.935
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,156,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think our vertical market business was obviously a by and large good story as well. Obviously Software as a Service, subscription based revenue streams withstood the pandemic very well. We saw great performance in a number of those channels. Obviously, a couple of those businesses were more negatively impacted, with school being closed for much of the second quarter, as well as our gaming business being exposed to closures of physical brick and mortar casinos. Obviously, those businesses were more negatively impacted, but on balance I would say our Vertical market business performed well, as a result of the focus on more recurring revenue streams, subscription-based revenues in those channels.",0.6466376,0.832
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,157,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I would say lastly, our relationship business here in the US performed quite well also, not withstanding, it's more focus on consumer discretionary verticals, as well as being more SMB-focused across the different businesses. It withstood, I think the pandemic very well. A lot of that was due to our ability to continue to sell effectively in this environment, offer new product and capability to our customers.",0.612391,0.885

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I think that's really the point that I would highlight, as it relates to the second part of your question. I think from a product and innovation standpoint, we're really at the intersection of you know, what our customers were demanding, and obviously, the impacts of the pandemic. Our ability to roll out online ordering capability, safe commerce capability in our different vertical market businesses. Our ability to deliver those quickly, ubiquitously, with ease and to be able to integrate them with existing card present capabilities, as I think we're uniquely positioned to be able to do, I think that allowed us to really win in this environment, continue to gain share and positions us well, I think for a very bright future, as we really have the products and solutions and the capabilities, and we have the distribution modes to be able to deliver them very quickly to customers in a difficult environment. And I think that's one of the hallmarks of the second quarter that I would highlight.",0.3088418,0.979
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,159,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah, I think Darrin, its Jeff. I would just say this is a continuation of the theme that we've had for years here, which is a further movement toward technology enablement, and differentiated distribution of what we've been - you know of what we've been doing. So if you look at as Paul on Cameron said, the businesses that have performed best, our integrated business, our ecom and omni business, elements of our Heartland business, they're specific to omni-channel delivery, our exposure to emerging markets.",0.2708185,0.751
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,160,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Those are the same themes that we've had for a really long period of time, the ability to get 95% of our workforce working from home and relatively - in relatively short order. Those speak to I think, and then obviously, the culmination today as announced at AWS really on the issuing side across the full lifecycle of what we're selling globally in the issuing business. We wouldn't be in the position we're in today if we hadn't started the journey many, many years ago toward technology, toward technology enablement.",0.197153,0.318
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,161,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I think as difficult as an environment as it is on the macro because of the terrible effects of that pandemic, nonetheless, I think this is the culmination of years of investment in differentiated distribution and technologies and I think you're seeing it all. At the same time, I would say, normalize to the macro, this might be the best quarter we've ever produced in a macro neutral environment. And I think that's a culmination of many quarters investment.",0.3302491,-0.169

Jeff, just real quick follow up is on M&A, are we still in an uncertain such an environment that you'd want to hold off or would you say you'd be more you know, willing and active now and what areas would it be now? Would it be you know, still software focus or a little bit more on the operating leverage and scale side on acquiring or others? Thanks, guys.",0.4498082,0.678
GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,163,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So Darrin, we just announced a deal this morning, so prosperously We're obviously pretty active and not kind of waiting. It just so happens with a good long-standing partner of ours, but nonetheless, a deal this morning. So I would say our pipeline is, I think Paul said in his remarks, our pipeline is very full.

Obviously, every day brings more information about what's going on in the marketplace. So we're certainly open for business. We're certainly looking, it ultimately depends on the facts at the time.

In terms of what we're looking at, it's really across the board. We're looking at software deals, we're looking at competitive takeout deals, looking at deals in new geography.

Paul, just a question on the issuer segment, maybe a two part question there. One, the margins were up something like 600 basis points year-over-year.

We were very pleased with the 640 basis points. You saw in the first quarter, we were at 450 basis points. So it is better. But there's nothing one time there that would call out. We're going to be tracking really strong on the margin front, given all of the cost things that we're doing on that business.

GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,173,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And then on the volume side for Issuer. Yeah, we from a authorization and transaction volume standpoint, look just like the credit Visa credit numbers that you see out there. So nothing differential I would point out, it's just you're seeing kind of from an overall standpoint the fact that only a portion of our revenue mix, you know, is transaction volume related. So we're kind of growing through that pull down, so that - those numbers that you're seeing out of the network's on the volume side, given our market share look very similar to what we're seeing both from a June and July standpoints.",0.160503,0.889

And then, Jeff, congrats on the AWS partnership, maybe just two quick questions there.

GPN-2020-Q2-2020-08-03,176,Answer,2020-08-03,2,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah, so your first question, George, what I would say is new entrants, neobanks, retailers, the Ubers of the world? The answer is they're all in scope. So I think what we've been able to do here in this collaboration with AWS is more than triple our target addressable market for opportunities. So I really don't think that there's any area of the marketplace, either by segment or geographically that is any longer out of scope with AWS. That's kind of your first point.

We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and our exceptional results for the year. 2017 was one of our best years ever as a company by nearly any measure.

This amount included a $222 million benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities, based on the new U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%. This benefit was partially offset by an incremental estimated provision of $64 million, associated with the mandatory transition tax imposed by the new tax law on our foreign earnings, not previously subjected to U.S. tax.

In addition to these impacts in Q4, tax reform will also serve to lower our effective tax rate going forward, as a result of the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate. The transition to a territorial tax regime in the U.S. should also allow us to manage our global cash resources more efficiently and repatriate foreign source earnings in the future without incurring additional U.S. taxes.

First, under ASC 606, we are required to report GAAP revenues net of fees paid to payment networks rather than gross, with these amounts being reflected as a cost of service, as they have been historically. Secondly, for our gaming business, revenues associated with our cash advance solutions are now required to be reported net of associated commissions paid casinos. It is worth noting that neither of these changes have any impact on operating income, net income or earnings per share. Lastly, in addition to these changes in GAAP revenue presentation, under ASC 606, we expect to capitalize slightly more customer acquisition costs than we have historically, and we'll amortize these costs over a longer period of time, which will have a modestly favorable impact on operating income in 2018.",0.3191158,0.727

I would say nothing specific that I would call out on that front. I think, largely, it's rounding on the margin. I think, we kind of rounded up to 10% in Q3 and rounded down to 9% in Q4. We did have one less processing day in Q4 of 2017 versus Q4 of 2016. So that has a little bit of an impact on the result. But, I'll remind you, I mean, we guided our business to kind of high single digits, 7%, 8%, 9%. We produced 9% for our direct business.

Our guide contemplates12% to 15% growth on an apples-to-apples basis for 2018 versus 2017. And I would note that that reflects normalized organic growth of about 9% to 11% and for our -- excluding the wholesale business, it reflects normalized organic growth of somewhere in the 10% to 13% range. So, I think, as we're heading into 2018, we have a lot of momentum in the business from organic growth standpoint.

And then, just as a quick follow-up, I know, you guys have been talking about sort of maintaining high single digit organic growth in Europe. That's been the target for awhile; that's in the guide for 2018. But, should we be thinking that sort of first half growth in Europe will be stronger than back half, just given the comparisons, or maybe just any sort of cadence you can walk us through there?",0.0569079,0.941
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,57,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Georgia, it's Cameron, again. The way to think about it is we guide Europe on a local currency basis, the high single digit rates of organic growth. Now, obviously, currency tailwinds are going to impact those results as it did in Q4. I think, you're right, as it relates to 2018, I think, our current outlook would suggest that European growth on a reported basis would be better in the first half of the year because we do expect more currency tailwinds. Obviously, given the volatility we're seeing around currency, rates, it's hard for me to predict with great precision what the back half of the year is going to look like. So, I think your overall thesis is generally right. Overall, we manage that business to local currency growth and we are forecasting for 2018 high single digit rates of local currency organic growth in Europe.",0.2033001,0.965

GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,61,Question,2018-02-15,4,2017,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"You saw some very strong operating margin expansion in the December quarter, 190 basis points year-over-year. You've been largely in an investment mode in Europe as you kind of work on the Erste JV. How should we think about operating leverage going forward in Europe, especially given the strong organic growth profile that you have?",0.5696014,0.869
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,62,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Dave, it's Cameron. Let me just talk about the mathematics, and maybe I'll let Jeff comment a little bit about just the investments we're making in Europe and how we think about our business. I'd remind you, that business today is margins are in the high 40% range. So, when margins are at that level, I would say we're not really anticipating a great deal of margin expansion in Europe, going forward. We'd like to be able to maintain stable to slightly up margins in Europe. That is our expectation for that segment. A little bit of what you saw in Q4 was obviously lapping some of the investments that we made in the back half of 2016 as we worked to integrate Erste, as talked about previously. So, that integration is largely behind us. And obviously as a result of that, we produced strong margin expansion Q4 really on the backs of strong net revenue growth in Europe and again, just lapping those integration benefits in 2017.",0.1899128,0.889

GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,64,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Thanks Dave for the question. So, I would say, as we addressed in our prepared comments that we continue to roll out our technology enabled businesses globally. I think, Cameron in his remarks commented on the Erste joint venture and the fact that that's now into double digits. And I think that's a good template for other businesses, including when we close the HSBC new partnership, which of course will be in Mexico. But, I would say, it's a few things. We continue to take our technology and bring it overseas, make investments days in terms of new products, additional salespeople into markets that we think are faster growth. Erste, clearly in Continental Europe is a good template for that. So, we hope, we will be in Mexico when we look to close that deal later in 2018. So, if you think about our integrated and vertical markets business that we've been bringing overseas, you think about our e-com and omni business, which historically had its genesis, overseas those are really resident and accelerating in Europe.",0.7081851,0.963
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,65,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The other thing we mentioned, Dave, on our phone call was we're going to accelerate our investment in additional direct sales, not just here in the United States, but really around the world. We're very pleased with our existing sales folks globally, but we think there is an ability to take our direct sales model, which as you know, in the case of some of our businesses is mostly or largely commission based, and to take that model into newer markets. So, as we called out in our commentary, in 2018, we'll make incremental investments by way of bringing some of those models to markets like the United Kingdom, which is one of ones that we highlighted as part of our remarks. You throw that stuff together, Dave, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to grow those markets at very attractive rates. These are some of the investments we're making.",0.0540925,0.986
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,66,Question,2018-02-15,4,2017,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, Jeff. I'd be curious for your thoughts about how the merchant acceptance footprint in Europe is expanding for electronic payments, especially post interchange caps, both Visa and Mastercard have called out some expansion recently, especially in Germany?",0.9045211,0.802
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,67,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Dave, I think, you are exactly right and I think you've been on this point for quite some time and really rightly so. I think, started this was SEPA, as you just alluded to. And as we've talked about before PSD2 and now GDPR are really kind of upon us. As we said, we think that PSD2 is really directed at financial institutions and really opening up via API, the ability to get broader access into financial institution DDA accounts. As you know, we are not a bank in Europe. The way we go to market, this is like e-commerce and Realex. In Ireland, it is largely through developers and APIs. So, Dave, I think if you combine the cross-border incentives that you've seen by lowering of cost through SEPA with the openness that we've seen through PSD2 which is now here in 2018, that should be really nothing but good news for our business over the next number of years.",0.1911032,0.261
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,69,Question,2018-02-15,4,2017,Tien-Tsin Huang,JPMorgan Chase,"Thank you. I'll add to the Europe question. Europe you came in a little bit better than what we had. So, I'm curious how healthy is the end market, especially in the UK? I don't think, Cameron, I heard any UK comments, curious competitively macro economy wise, how the UK is performing?",0.0296121,0.938
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,70,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Tien-tsin, this is Cameron. Good morning. I'll comment maybe on the results and let Jeff talk a little bit about the environment as well. I would say, the UK in Q4 performed very much in line with our expectations. It had been for the last couple of quarters, I think, low double digit on a local currency basis, as we talked about previously. That's not our expectation for growth in the UK. It was closer to high single digits in this particular quarter with obviously about 800 basis points of currency tailwind, benefiting the overall Europe results. And that's largely driven by the pound and our performance in the UK, so high single digit performance. I would say retail sales in Q4 in UK were fairly poor overall and certainly down I think relative to what we've seen over the course of the year. That's not an uncommon phenomenon in UK, frankly heading into the winter, so even after a strong tourism season this past summer. But, I think we would view the overall market as fairly stable. I think, we remained very pleased with how our business is performing there. We believe we continue to gain share in the market that's otherwise growing probably in the low single digit rate. We're growing at least high single digits in that market, and that's our expectation going into 2018 as well. So, I think our franchise is well-positioned. To that comments Jeff made earlier, I think we're bringing new technology, more differentiated solutions to that market that are helping us to gain share. And I think, we remain very well poised to continue to grow that business at that targeted high-single-digit rates going into 2018 and beyond.",0.2957659,0.987
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,71,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Tien-tsin, it's Jeff. I would say what we saw in the fourth quarter in the UK in terms of retail sales is very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2016. I think it's very similar to what Visa said about their experience with retail sales in the UK in the December time period. Nonetheless, we think we're growing at least 4 times the rate of market growth, currently in the UK. I'd chop that up to a few things. First, I think, like most of the rest of the world, we really target the SMB customers. So, while we have a national business across all of the United Kingdom, we make most of our money and certainly most of our revenue and our pretax from SMB. And obviously, we're very selective by way of vertical market in terms of which SMB areas that we're in. I think, you can see that reflect in the sustained market share gains that we're seeing around the world, but in particular, in light of your question, in the United Kingdom.",0.0580071,0.907
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,72,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The second thing, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in light of David Togut's comments, we continue to make investments in Europe, but for these purposes in the United Kingdom. So, more sales, we talk about expanding our direct sales footprint in Europe, including the United Kingdom. The UK was one of the early markets, next to Canada that we brought our integrated and vertical markets from the U.S. into, over the last number of years. And to be candid, Europe and in particular UK is where our e-com and omni business also targeted at SMB and cross-border multinationals, really is also domiciled in addition to Ireland and Spain.",0.0637011,0.834
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,73,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I think, Tien-tsin, you're seeing a continued share gain in Europe and in UK on our side, really driven by the way we go to market, the investments we made and of course I've given away a little bit of the story in a couple weeks and more to come in the Investor Day. But, I think it's a continuation of the trend that you've seen over the last number of years.",0.23879,0.71
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,74,Question,2018-02-15,4,2017,Tien-Tsin Huang,JPMorgan Chase,"Got it. It's great to see. This is my quick follow-up, I know, -- just on the U.S. direct, I know we all split hairs over high single versus low double digit growth, but what is the swing factor that's maybe under your control to get you to that low double? Because, I know you are running above market. So, to get to low double, what needs to happen under your control?",0.2925674,-0.433
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,75,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Tien-tsin. So, I think we're on that trajectory already. I think, as Cameron mentioned, heading into 2018, in terms of our guidance, and obviously, we're now sitting here in February, our expectations for our U.S. direct business, as Cameron mentioned a minute ago, is high single digits, low double digits, which to be honest is probably the highest rate of guidance growth for that business that we've ever given since I've been at the Company for the last 8 years. So, to answer your, I think, the macro extent of your question, I really think that we're already there. Now, why are we already there and why are we accelerating that rate of growth versus history, I think it's the investments we've made in our distribution, in our technology footprint over the last number of years. Probably over the last five years we've invested $7 billion by way of principally M&A, but also technology investments. And of course, the U.S. at nearly three quarters of the Company is a primary -- necessarily the primary beneficiary of those investments. So, you'll hear more in a couple of weeks about the mixes and everything else. As I said in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect our mix shift to favor our technology-enabled businesses is a bigger percentage of the Company going forward. I think that's reflected in what is certainly since we've been here, the fastest rate of organic revenue guidance in 2018 that we've ever given.",0.766548,0.954
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,76,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Tien-tsin, this is David. Maybe to add a little more color to that, I like phrase sort of splitting hairs over this. What we see in the business is really building momentum. We have the sales force that we will expect to add on the order of 200 plus net new sales folks this coming year, all increasingly selling technology-enabled, software-driven solutions. So, we're not selling bricks on countertops. And again, I don't want to get too far than two weeks from now, but we're selling solutions to customers, that drives uniquely low merchant attrition rates, drives higher growth, obviously stickier solutions. All that's built into the kind of growth numbers that Cameron and Jeff are describing. The execution level is very high. So, rather than split hairs over sequential this and sequential that, we're growing faster than anybody in the market here at the end.",0.410522,0.89
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,79,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. It was around the midpoint of the range that we had provided to you previously, going into the quarter, Dan, which was 40 to 45.",0.4066002,0.402
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,81,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. I mean, we've given you the wholesale number for North America. Canada, I think, you have a pretty good sense as to what Canada contributes annually in terms of U.S. dollar revenue, just north of $300 million; the rest is our U.S. direct business. It's really not a lot more complicated than that. And if you think about the U.S. direct business, it's obviously a combination of our integrated and vertical markets business which we target low double digit growth for that channel. And if you think about the remainder, it's going to be more of our traditional direct sales force, but today, at this point, more and more selling technology-enabled, software-driven solutions as well. That business, we target high single to low double. And that's our expectation kind of going into 2018. So, you roll all that together and you're going to get a North American business, ex wholesale that we've been just poised to grow at the high -- very high single digit level or the low double digit level, going into 2018, which again is above the rate of expectation that we've had for that business historically.",0.0871731,0.625
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,82,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I'd also say Dan that -- on your question about the ISOs, I'd say, it's a few things. First, first for a number of years, as you've heard from us, we've had ISOs convert on us from ISO related contracts in a way they sell technologies into what we call indirect customers, where they really buy our technologies wholesale. So, part of the assumption of decline is just a continued mix shift among the ISOs that are existing customers that ISOs will just convert over to our existing customers as indirect, and that's been a continuation of trend.",0.8120996,0.077
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,83,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The second thing I'd say is, well, I think, we'll always have an element of the ISO business within Global Payments. What I'll say is that increasingly we are not signing new ISOs to the customer. When contracts come up with existing ISOs, we choose not to renew on number of those. So, I would say, Dan, it's really a combination of conversion from one type of customer to another, which impacts our revenue, and that's been happening for a period of time, combined with us focusing on the direct distribution that we've spent $7 billion on investing in terms of where we're signing up new accounts.",0.1925267,0.34
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,86,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Sure, Glenn, it's Cameron. I'll kind of kick it off. And again, I think, to your point, we're cautious about getting ahead of ourselves with respect to the March 1st Investor Day. We don't want to give you guys a reason not to attend. Kidding. But, I think as we tried to set up in the script and in some of the commentary today and all of this, I think is reflected in our guidance for 2018, given the success we've had in shifting our business mix over the last several years, continuing to drive more technology-enabled, software-driven solutions in our business, our e-com, and omni-channel successes around the globe and how again we're utilizing our sales force more and more to sell these differentiated product suites, as well as the fact that we continue to move away and our wholesale business continues to decline as a portion of the overall company. We feel like we are in a position to be able to raise our expectations for organic growth on a topline basis for the Company going forward. Historically, as you'll recall that's been high single digit since the merger with Heartland back in 2015, so call that 7, 8, 9. Clearly, that number is going to 15, but we certainly think it's going to go to a number of 7, 8, 9. We'll give a little more color around that when we get to the investor conference in a couple of weeks.",0.1852428,0.936
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,87,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I'd also note that we think about our business kind of ex that wholesale business. We're going to wind that down over a period of time. As Jeff highlighted, we don't sign new ISOs. We're not renewing ISOs typically as they come up for renewal. And obviously, we have a handful of ISOs which is becoming more and more of a trend that are moving from direct relationships with us to indirect relationships with us. So that business is going to continue to shrink. So, we think about the business we're managing is really, ex that ISO wholesale channel in North America, and we think the investments we've made are going to position us to drive higher rates organic growth above that 7, 8, 9 that we've been able to deliver historically. Even including the ISO business, as you flow that through then to earnings, we think we're in a position to drive sustained rates of adjusted earnings per share growth above what we've been targeting historically which is mid teens.",0.0706725,0.751
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,88,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Again, I don't think we're trying to compound 25% earnings growth annually. We'd love to be in a position to do that. But certainly, we think that we can deliver on a sustained basis adjusted earnings per share growth above that mid teen level going forward, and we think that's a very attractive, obviously opportunity for investors. Our ability to sustain and compound adjusted earnings per share growth saying that high teens level I think is a very -- creates a very attractive opportunity for this business as we look into 2018 and beyond. So, to your point earlier, a lot more to comment at the investor conference. We think our guide for 2018 directionally gives a good sense as to where we see this business going over the course of time and we look forward to sharing lot more detail in a couple of weeks.",0.1759029,0.99
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,89,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Glenn, it's Jeff. I would just add on to that. I know there is a bunch of moving with the ASC implementation and everything else. I think, there is very good schedule that Cameron's team posted on our website about apples-to-apples comparisons. Cameron hit it head-on. This is the fastest rate of organic revenue growth for 2018 that we've guided to you collectively since this group has been here by way of revenue and the like. That is not an accident and well above the 7 to 9, for those purposes of actually including the ISOs within it and well above the 7 to 9 number that we talked back in our last cycle guide, historically. I think Cameron said in his prepared remarks including the ISO business reflect 9 to 11 on an organic basis the rest being ACTIVE to get you 12 to 14. So, I think you put that together Glenn, you look at 9 to 11 revenue guide organically for 2018 on a model historically that we told you the 7 to 9, having just finished the year what was low double digits as I said in the introductory and my comments in the press release, it makes us feel pretty good about where we're heading.",0.3163701,0.977
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,91,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, Glenn, I will start and ask David to comment a little bit more of the detail of the market in Mexico. So, first, we're delighted to announce the entry of Mexico. For long time, of course, we viewed ourselves by the name of Global, as a global company. Yet sitting here in the United States, we were not in all of North America. So, Mexico, going back to Paul's days, was always a target for us. And we couldn't be more pleased to have HSBC as our long-term partner. I think, they've been a partner for ours in various forms for half a century, which is how old our Company is through 2017, so yet another partnership, following on the heels with HSBC in the United Kingdom, in Asia Pacific and now in Mexico. The other thing I'll say is that it's a two partnership and that is 50-50. We're both extremely excited about the growth opportunities of the market in Mexico where we have a significant presence. And as a result we're going to share the upside and opportunities as equal partners together. David, do you want to go through some of the detailsâ¦",0.0149466,0.975
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,92,Question,2018-02-15,4,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, happy to. I think, it starts, Glenn, with what Jeff said, which is we're just thrilled to partner with HSBC around the world. This puts us in something on the order of 15 markets around the world where we partner with HSBC. And as you know from our Asia and our UK results, it's been nothing but wildly successful for the last, I won't say the 50 years, because I haven't been around for all those, at least the last kind of 11 or so, you can count from the original Asia deal the Company did back in 2006. So, we think that partnership, that marriage of Global Payments and HSBC, in market a like Mexico where you've got 125 million somewhat folks in the population, nominal GDP is what 12th or 15th in the world, something along those lines, high growth GDP and a partner where we know how to work and partner together, this is a great partner that got sort of the fifth largest branch presence on the order of 1,000 in major economic areas, your Guadalajaras, your Monterreys as well as Mexico City itself, lots of ATMs, lots of regional presence, really good business banking and small business franchise, which as you know is core to what we do around the world. So, we love the presence, like the pieces of it, a nice SME merchant presence already which we can grow. So, all those piece are there. What we plan to do is go apply our U.S. direct sales methodology, U.S. direct sales methods and techniques to the Mexican market. There is nice electronic payments growth, currently not a ton of credit card penetration but nice debit card penetration. So, pretty good model for what we like to do with HSBC, go chase small and medium business, go do it with our U.S. sales model, marry to the partnership with HSBC. We're pretty excited about.",0.3442419,0.997

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And Glenn, just on your last comment, our investment in the joint venture is going to be less than $50 million. So, it's a relatively nominal investment for us to have the opportunity and to partner with HSBC. To David's point, we've been very successful with them over the course of a very long period of time in a market that we think has very attractive secular fundamentals going forward.

I would say, to step back for a second, at the highest level you can think of, we still chase GDP. So, I think as David alluded to, when he talks about the opportunity in Mexico, we certainly look at the demographics and economic statistics of a market before we decide to go enter in, I think Mexico, there is no different. That's probably the highest level. Healthy growing economies are very important, not just to our business but to Visas, Mastercards, PayPal, go down the list, obviously that's an important thing.",0.3736655,0.817
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,97,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say though, you asked a very insightful question on how do we think about the markets, the vertical markets now that we've been chasing. And I think you're right in what you said. I think at the end of the day, most of our vertical markets on investments, and now I'm thinking about dental and veterinary and some of the areas that have really been core for us at Global Payments including a school, K-12, and university. I would say in general, those are somewhat decoupled from the macro environment, certainly relative to the last Investor Day in 2015. So, you think about an integrated and vertical markets business today that you'll hear in a couple of weeks, is about $1.2 billion in size. And you think about a lot of that now being in the markets that you would say are somewhat less sensitive because your schools, universities, dental and veterinary and healthcare, for dietary, et cetera that hopefully are less correlated to the overall rate of accelerating economic growth around the world.",0.1291815,0.772

And I'll tell you that probably for the first time, Cameron, in the last few years, probably the last six to nine to 12 months, every market we're in globally has been growing. That wasn't true for a period of time in parts of China, that wasn't true in Brazil and Russia and some other markets. But that has been true.

That's why, if you go back to what Cameron said in light -- on Glenn's question about the cycle that you'll hear more in a couple of weeks, yes, it's the investments in our businesses, it's mix shift that does give us confidence in giving the best forward look for 2018 by way of revenue growth that we've ever given while we're seven or eight years into an expansionary economy here in the United States, which is three quarters of our business.",0.0309609,0.95

I think what you're also hearing is increasing confidence, given our execution at being able to globalize the solutions Jeff described. Integrated payments with which you're familiar with over the years, but increasingly the software solutions. Our revenue synergy tracker alone this year where we did deliver over 50 basis points of growth that we talked about, and we're on track for the over 100 basis points of growth for 2018, all fuels this increase. And we're selling the software solutions we own in markets around the world, great track record there. We already know about the globalizing of integrated payments, increasing these more and more enriched solutions with analytics and other services on top, again, uniquely globalizing those types of things.",0.6607291,0.973
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,102,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Ashwin, it really does not the way we traditionally use pricing. So, just to be clear, we have not done what -- as we said would not, have not done broad-based repricing of Heartland, which by the way is consistent if you go back to 2015. What we've talked about and I think David has mentioned this many times. What we talked about is charging fairly for value that we're creating. So, that means when we're introducing new analytics and new data products, of course, those should be really coming in at market. That means when existing customer relationships reach the end of the maturity of their initial contractual terms, understanding where the market is at that point of time. And to be clear, we have not done those things yet at Heartland, whether it's the fourth quarter of 2017 or since we've been partner since April of 2016. So, there has really been none of that in the results that you've seen today. On a go forward basis, of course, we certainly intend to manage it as we said all along, much closer to where we think the market will be going forward and the types of things that we would do, what I just suggested around contracts that come up for maturity, moving them closer to market that has not in fact occurred to date.",0.03879,0.919

GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,108,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say nicely above current cycle guidance, Dave.",0.1939502,0.44
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,110,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, I think, it is. I mean, we feel very good about our ability to convert obviously EBITDA into free cash flow of the business, and I think 2017 is evidence of that. I think, if we look at 2018 and beyond, I think, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to convert it at fairly high pace. As our CapEx guidance suggests for 2018, we are reinvesting a fair amount back into the business. Our guide is $210 million off of I think an actual of around 185 for 2017. So, we continue to invest in the business. And I think that's a very important thing to highlight. We're not producing these results by virtue of starving the business. We're investing in technology, we're investing in solutions, we're globalizing these solutions, we're globalizing unique distribution capabilities. We're doing all this at a time when we're still producing exceptionally strong financial results, investing in the business for future growth. And I think that's a big part of what underlies our confidence and the ability to grow the business at the level that we're forecasting going into 2018 and beyond.",0.8300125,0.988
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,111,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"If you take our 2018 guide even at the midpoint and you overlay that, a little bit of a commentary you heard today around cycle guidance or adjusted earnings per share growth going forward, it's not hard to see something close to or at maybe 6 in 2019. As a reminder, we did 3.19 for 2016. So, almost 90% growth over a three-year period; that's pretty attractive compounded earnings growth for a business of this nature. I don't know anybody else with a similar characteristic business putting out that type of growth.",0.1444583,0.952
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,114,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Great, question, Andrew. So, what I would say is, I typically think that Europe is really just being in a first inning of ISV, VAR penetration. The size of those economies, the maturity of technology in Europe as well as in Asia for that matter, really, puts it at the very beginning of the game. The way I could think about it, Andrew, is if Global Payments were a public company on the FTSE, we're probably one of the two or three largest technology companies listed in the United Kingdom. I think we're doing great here, but we're somewhere in the S&P 500, and it's probably not in top 100. And that gives you a sense of size by way of market value as to how those two markets compare.",0.1174377,0.832
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,115,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I would say, we're in the first inning. I think we've been in ISV VAR land in Europe. I think we've been successful in taking our integrated and vertical markets businesses from the United States, we're net exporter of those businesses into Canada and then into the UK and into Europe. The e-com and omni businesses have already been domiciled there historically because of common purchasing area that you see in the EU, even though there are different countries pre and post SEPA. But we're very early on there. By way of comparison, I'd say the U.S., maybe we're in the fifth inning of ISV VAR land. And I would also say that our ability to continue growth in the United States, I said this in my prepared remarks, but another double digit organic revenue performance in integrated and vertical markets, the vast majority of which is here in the United States in the fourth quarter. And as Cameron said for our guide, obviously we expect to continue to try to guide to the low to mid-teens organic numbers for 2018 when the U.S. is three quarters of the company, of course, that's where it's coming from. But I would say, here in the United States, it's a little different and answer to your question is the only software model.",0.0259786,0.916
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,116,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I think where we've been distinctive and we'll talk about this on March 1st is, with a great market share gains, call it 2x the rate plus of market growth in our partner model. But now the own, the whole vertical stack of opportunities in the United States and we'll look to export that, Andrew, not just to Europe, but also to Asia. In fact, I think as David has mentioned, bringing our Campus Solutions, TouchNet into the United Kingdom where we have a very large share of universities are ready, it's something we've done, bringing our Xenial restaurant hospitality business into cloud from the United States into Europe, it's something that we have been doing and have done. So, I think we have the ability by way of some of the owned assets to really catalyze, Andrew, a bit of growth in Europe. I think there is no denying that we're probably in the first inning in Europe with where that technology stuff is, yet we're still growing at 4x the rate of market growth today.",0.3241993,0.982
GPN-2017-Q4-2018-02-15,118,Answer,2018-02-15,4,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Andrew, it's Cameron. Good morning. I don't know that I would put a particular sort of targeted cadence around those opportunities. I think, as we indicated when we announced that arrangement back in our second quarter earnings call, we feel very good about the portfolio of companies that they have. We feel obviously encouraged about our ability to continue to provide differentiated technology enabled payment solutions to those businesses. And we think we have a nice pipeline building with them. But again, we feel as if we have to earn every one of those opportunities. Every arrangement is a unique arrangement with one of their portfolio companies. I think, we have the right cadence around how we're approaching those conversations. But, I don't want to put a particular target as to how we're going to continue to build on the successes we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Obviously, it'd be nice to do at least one a quarter, but our focus is really on making sure we can demonstrate a value proposition to those companies that works for them and making sure we're doing it on economic terms that work for us. And I think we'll continue to have a lot of success with that.",0.6463263,0.982

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,So as we talked about when we announced de deal combining TSYS with Global Payment gives us just south of $1 billion of integrated revenue. We have just south of $1 billion of e-com and omnichannel revenue. And we talked about roughly $800 million or so of software revenue in our portfolio. So that ends up being close to half of the overall merchant business on a global basis.,0.2229141,0.0

And then on the issuer side, you mentioned you get a full pipeline. How about on the merchant front, any comments on pipeline or bookings on the software side?

GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,119,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, I'll talk a little bit about pipeline on the merchant side Tien-tsin. As you know our focus tends to be small to medium-sized businesses. So when we think about the pipeline for the businesses, it's a little bit different than obviously the issuer business which tends to be more large FI-focused. But I would say momentum in both of our businesses is very good.",0.1945828,0.709
GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,120,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As we talked about in our integrated business, Paul gave a little bit color on how TSYS performed. We commented that OpenEdge grew high teens in the quarter which is the high watermark for that business certainly over the last several years which I think reflects a strong new partner growth over the course of the last couple of years and obviously, good effectiveness at converting existing customers of our partners to payments customers of Global Payments which has been obviously an important part of our growth story over time.",0.3284558,0.927
GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,121,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"The second thing I would say in our own software businesses, we continue to see strong bookings growth across AdvancedMD and ACTIVE as well. SICOM had a very strong quarter and has very strong momentum heading into 2020 having received recently some positive news from one of its largest customers about a rollout of a new product across its base of franchisees in 2020 which we think will be a nice tailwind for that business heading into the year.",0.3988169,0.973
GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,122,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Cameron M.

GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,123,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, I would say all-in-all across the merchant business, certainly in the US, we've seen very strong trends. Europe improved quarter-over-quarter accelerated on an organic growth basis, largely driven by slightly better performance in the UK. And, of course, Spain and our Central European joint venture with Erste performed really well in the quarter as well.",0.3430884,0.952

We had an all-time record level of net revenue in the merchant solutions area. Our integrated - with legacy TSYS, integrated business grew in the strong double-digit range. We did get some accretive growth from the legacy indirect side. So much similar to Cameron's comments on the legacy Global side, it's just a great quarter from a merchant standpoint.",0.6494662,0.917

And I think the governance model and structure that we put around the process itself I think has given us very strong start to obviously our working relationship and the ability to drive obviously ahead of schedule expense actions that we intend to take as we look to bring these two businesses together.

We feel good enough to increase our target expectations around expense synergies on the whole. And as we said on the call and mentioned earlier on the Q&A, we had line of sight to $100 million of run rate synergies in 2020 already and the actions we've taken will allow those to materialize next year as we continue to look to do more for 2021 and 2022.",0.4480075,0.862

And the only thing David I would add is from a legacy TSYS perspective, we said this at the time of the deal that we knew each company very well. Both companies had a long history of knowing each other and we knew that that was going to provide kind of additive tailwinds from the synergy standpoint of just that expertise that we both had at our legacy businesses and the complementary nature of the two legacy companies putting them together.

GPN-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,144,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,I would also say as I mentioned that PSD2 and strong customer penetration is now the Global land as of mid-September in Europe. While that's been - took the regulators have joined pushed the back to 12 months in terms of terms of implementation. I think that's good news good news for us.

I think that is a differentiator for us. Number two, I do think there are a lot of revenue synergies coming out of Global Payments and Netspend.

And we actually did hear that there's still some opportunities on the TSYS side that were let's call it relatively underpriced. I know you have legacy on Heartland side.",0.2647059,0.758

That's the new initiative that's called Spring by Citi, so in essence, you can think about it as a referral deal, but as it relates to UCP specifically, so it's specific to the unified commerce product offering that we've been talking about for probably about a year now, specific to multinational customers on an omnichannel basis.",0.3419929,0.751

For example, a recent sell-side survey of acquiring industry participants concluded first that payments companies owning vertical-specific software was the preferred strategy to enhance market share, and second that, that trend toward ownership was increasing over time. In fact, the same survey highlighted restaurants, education and healthcare as the leading verticals for payments and software integrations. And today, we own solutions in all three.

To kick things off, maybe on the margin side because that outperformed our expectations considerably. I guess, you're starting the year up 110 basis points. That includes FX pressure. You're guiding to 80 bps for the full year. Should we assume that there'll be an increase in some discretionary spend? And then also the margins in APAC were extraordinarily strong, I think the strongest ever. Anything to kind of call out there?",0.2154605,0.951
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,48,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, George. It's Cameron. I'll start and ask Jeff to chime in if he has any additional color he'd like to add. You're right as it relates to the way we're guiding for the full year. The guide obviously reflects ongoing investment back into the business. A few specific things obviously here in North America are going to be around our vertical market and software businesses where we continue to invest in new product, new feature functionality in the software solutions to drive that topline growth. So, we have a fairly healthy amount of investment associated with that plan for the back three quarters of the year.",0.0127646,0.881

There's a fair amount of investment to get that new proposition up and running with our partner, Erste Bank. We're obviously excited about the opportunity to enter a new market with our strong partner and obviously, the growth potential that provides for our Central European business going forward. And then lastly, with respect to Asia, I think what we're seeing in Asia is much the same thing we talked about -- excuse me, the same theme we've talked about over the last couple of years, which is really increased tail.",0.3343711,0.953

We've obviously been able to expand margins fairly meaningfully over the past few years, and of course first -- the first quarter was no exception to that. We do have again more investments planned in the back three quarters in the year in Asia that will result in an overall margin expansion in Asia, not at the same level that we saw in the first quarter, but we expect margins to expand very nicely in Asia for the full year period.",0.1257783,0.842

I think at the time of the Heartland acquisition, the average merchant was, call it, doing about 500,000 of volume or so. Has that changed materially over the last few years? And any sort of updated thoughts around -- if you sort of segment the market at the high end and low end, maybe a bit of a different approach, as going via partners or just owning the software and going direct for sort of specific segmentation of the restaurant market?",0.1194079,-0.353
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,54,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Thanks, George. That's a great question. So, we provide a lot of segmentation detail on the restaurant strategy tables in the prepared remarks as well as online with our slides. I'll take your questions in series here. First, does the size matter? The answer is, no. It's still not the same size as it relates to the core Heartland -- what we call Heartland restaurant on the slide that you'll see online. But of course, what is different is first the, addition of SICOM. So the partnership with SICOM that we announced in October is primarily at the enterprise QSR and food service management vertical. That not surprisingly has a higher average than the 500,000. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, every Burger King in the United States, every Tim Hortons in North America, not surprising that's a little bigger than the legacy Heartland business from 3-plus years ago at the time of that merger.",0.0003559,0.91

GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,56,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I think what is distinctive about us, George, and I hope it came through in the prepared remarks and online is, no one really has the breadth of coverage we do in United States and globally in terms of distribution. We're incredibly proud of the efforts and success that our partners at Heartland and Xenial and SICOM have had on a direct basis and also in certain markets in conjunction with dealers.

What I would say is that the recent announcements in the competitive environment really validate the technology-enabled strategy that we've adopted over the last five-plus years.

I think if you step back for a second, as we just finished describing, our strategy as a company over the last five-plus years and going forward is to really combine leading-edge technology with defensible and distinctive distribution.

I would say that in the 9 plus years I've been at the Company, I don't think we've ever had more high-quality opportunity to expand our business organically.

So we've been very pleased with employee retention, motivation, attraction of new employees across all our businesses including in particular, at ACTIVE and AdvancedMD and all of our technology-enabled businesses. If you back up first, I think I probably told you before, Jim, when we first partnered with APT back in October of 2012 it was one of our big concerns. And I remember showing at that meeting, Jim, and you'll appreciate this, we used to wear suits, not ties here, and I kind of showed up at APT in the summer of 2012 in Utah and they were jeans and casual. As you know us today, Jim, we're pretty jeans casual around the rest of the Company.",1.1530249,0.98

The folks who are running AdvancedMD today, we're running ACTIVE today -- by the way the folks who are running OpenEdge, APT and papers today are folks who where employees of those companies, Jim, seven years later at the time that we did those transactions. The folks running realex today are employees of those companies that we did four and five years ago. Same thing is true with easy debit in Australia and New Zealand.",0.2996441,0.846

I think people are excited with the investments that we continue to make into additional vertical markets at software and new geographies with the business that we're in. I think we also provide usual opportunities in terms of mobility globally for folks who are running those businesses for us around the world.

So it's not surprisingly, probably don't want to give a lot of specific color about vertical markets that we may be targeting for competitive reasons. As you can imagine, and I think we've talked about this fairly extensively previously, we really target markets based on the size of the market opportunity. We look at markets where we have an opportunity to acquire the number one, two or three player, where you're still operating in a highly fragmented market with a lot of opportunity for software growth, as well as obviously the opportunity to monetize payments, where there's a strong nexus between software and payments.",0.1889788,0.964
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,77,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We also look at vertical markets that have some broad-based international applicability, where obviously by owning the underlying technology ourselves, we can determine the pace at which we look to export those solutions and bring them to other markets outside of the U.S. where we operate today. So that's generally kind of how we think about the market opportunity. It's to deploy more capital from an acquisition standpoint. And we obviously weigh that against those markets where we already have strong partnerships today to make sure that we're obviously managing kind of our owned software strategy expansion vis-a-vis our partnership model, which has been highly successful for us and continues to grow at a very nice pace. So you can probably draw your own conclusions as to what markets would and what verticals would meet those criteria.

So I would say that snapshot overall is that consumer is healthy. You saw the GDP number in the United States that go out a day or two ago at over 3%, so one of the higher numbers that you've seen over the last number of years. So if you back up further, I think we said this in the February call, Jason, we're a little concerned in Canada and the United Kingdom in the last two weeks of December, as we said, thinking the -- in terms of healthy consumer.",0.2423488,0.923

So, you never know Jason in December if it's like the weather, the day of the week that Christmas falls on, that kind of thing. It tends to be very holiday-driven. But that obviously flipped, as we said, in February for January. You can see that reflected really in our results today. So, those were things that we were watching for.",0.1174377,0.361
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,84,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We never really saw the impact in Asia. If you go back to the fall of 2018 when people were talking a lot about the tariffs, I think we said pretty consistently is the biggest impact for us was movements in FX and you can hear that today in Cameron's commentary too. But it really wasn't the health of the consumer issue in APAC for us. And I think you can see that playing through the fourth quarter now the first quarter of 2019, which is to say very consistent performance on the consumer in Asia Pacific through the first quarter of 2019 with a 13% organic constant currency revenue growth rate that Cameron gave.",0.888968,0.765
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,85,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I would say a lot around the world, Jason, very consistent with what we saw kind of in the February call time frame. Probably moderately better a little bit in United States, so that GDP print that we saw the other day, but I would say the consumer remains financially healthy. As it relates to Easter, that stuff is on the calendar, I mean we know how to model that stuff. So regardless of what quarter things fall in, number -- processing date, et cetera, we take those into account when we do our budgeting.

Maybe just a couple of other points I'd add to that as a reminder, in our largest market in the US market we are skewed probably toward more consumer non-discretionary. So, we do tend to see a little bit better trend even through an overall cycle than maybe other of our competitors might see, number one. Number two, where we do have more consumer discretionary exposure, in areas like restaurant, again we're skewed toward QSR where again even in a downturn you would see generally healthier performance as that is the market that tends to hold up a little bit better in those types of cycles as well.",0.7696139,0.857

And I know this -- you touched on this a bit before, but your OpenEdge business continued to grow at a pretty strong -- at a record rate. So it doesn't really look like we're seeing the evidence of that in your numbers at least [indiscernible]. So, I'd like to hear, is it you're doing something differently? Is that sustainable? Or are you seeing some of the ISVs try to do their own payments initiatives more so and is that having any impact on the business? Can you give us more color there and then other partners in the pipeline?",0.1297954,0.964

So if you go back to our February call, we announced three significant wins. I think all three were involved in RFPs. We gave more color this morning around Tyler and ASI and Gather and ChiroTouch, which were RFPs that we won toward the end of last year. And as we gave color this morning, we've actually rolled that out to a number of municipalities, as well as chiropractors already. And those were all competitive bidding situations.",0.6996441,0.964
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,94,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I think part of the answer is I think we've done a very good job with our folks on the sales side. But I think part of the other answer is that we've built a very good mousetrap. So putting aside execution of sales, which is critical, I'd also say that our ability to go multinational in scope, Tyler, for example, is multinational in its nature; our ability to offer cross-border, as well as native in other markets like Canada and the United Kingdom; our ability to offer OpenEdge like products to partner with ISVs on a multinational basis, is really very distinctive to us.",0.330605,0.958
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,95,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I'd also say our architecture in OpenEdge is something, as Cameron alluded to, we made a lot of investment in. It's API-centric, it's mobile-based in a lot of cases. And not everybody has those things particularly in multiple jurisdictions. Lastly, as I'd say as it relates to your question about the VAR, ISO with the pay pack that was a concern when we first bought APT seven years ago. That concern really has been, in fact, unfounded as it relates to at least our business. So in fact, we tend to find that our partners are focused on growing their software revenue base. I think they've realized that we're good and have scale in what we do. With some of these large companies that we've announced partnerships with recently, it's not been an issue.",0.5733096,0.7

So my own view is that things haven't really changed. The market, of course, it's always been highly competitive. But I think we'd win with, let's be honest, better sales, better execution, better technology, more markets, more multiple markets in which we can provide the solutions. And really, the proof is in the pudding.",1.0558719,0.983

The only other thing I would add to that is we win even in those situations where often our competitors will offer a higher rev share out of the gate. And that goes to show what we've been saying for years, which is a one, not all integrated is created equal. And two, the decision-making process as it relates to the ISV involves a lot more than how much rev share you're willing to give me. So I think our track record, the breadth and depth of the capabilities we have across vertical markets with thousands of different partners, has really given us a nice competitive advantage in that space.

So we actually made a fair amount of progress on the payments penetration that we alluded to at AdvancedMD. So what I would tell you is very substantial increase in leads to our OpenEdge partners.

So, we're starting to integrate payroll into what we're offering to physician's offices, so we feel pretty good about the progress we've made on the referral integration. If you step back further, it's not that particularly large of a business. At AdvancedMD, we all fit in size of Global Payments. So additions in the 7-figure range actually add meaningfully to what AdvancedMD is generating. It's not going to make a big economic impact, given our guide and overall Global Payments. But it's really important for us to be able to put out the strategy to continue to develop the morale at AdvancedMD and here at Global Payments and with OpenEdge in our payroll department.",0.2928826,0.928
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,108,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Glenn, it's Cameron. I would say AdvancedMD did perform better than our expectations for the first quarter and that's largely coming off strength on the back half of 2018 as a bookings matter. As you can understand, there's a period of time between sort of a booking and obviously revenue generation for that business. The strength that we saw in the business in the back half of the year kind of leading into '19 obviously positions them to do better and frankly we had budgeted for the first quarter and now suggests it's not a huge amount in the grand scheme of over $1 billion of revenue, but obviously every little bit helps.",1.0426526,0.889
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,109,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Bookings in the first quarter were strong above budget. So I think that bodes well for that business continuing to perform well for the balance of 2019 and hopefully, will continue to exceed the expectations we've set for that team. So, we're delighted with the progress thus far and continue to believe there's a lot of opportunity to grow and expand that business in a highly fragmented, under-penetrated market.",0.3209838,0.962
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,111,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"It's a lot about business mix. I wouldn't want to suggest that we expect to see the rest of the three quarters of the year at that same expansion level as we are making investment back into the business. As I'm sure you appreciate, Glenn, starting out the year, the investment tends to go in a little bit slower and then ramp up as the year progresses. So I think the outlook for the full year kind of reflects that that we'll expect to see more investment kind of Q2, three and four as we continue to look to drive, again, higher rates of top line growth and balancing reinvesting in the business with how much we want to flow through, through margins to the bottom line. So I think obviously, Q1 was better than our expectations from a margin standpoint. That's flowing through into the increased outlook for the full year, but our investment plans also remain on track for the full year as well.",0.4037983,0.846
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,114,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Great question, Andrew. So we looked at some of those companies that I think have done that on Page 3 in the slides that we posted this morning. So I would say it's a good thing for our business that folks have done stuff like that because it pushes us to evolve even further and quicker and pay more attention than even we otherwise would. So I think what's distinctive about us, Andrew, other than making a profit, which I think is somewhat unique versus some of those folks who are raising the capital, is not only do we think we have market-competitive to market-leading products, which we detail in the slides, but Andrew, we also have an existing sales force at Heartland and also have more than 300 dealers already in the case of Heartland Restaurant.",0.2697509,0.781
GPN-2019-Q1-2019-05-03,115,Answer,2019-05-02,1,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"In the case of Xenial Sicom, where those investments have also occurred at the enterprise level, we have more than 20 people doing direct sales at the enterprise QSR and foodservice level. So I think it's absolutely a dogfight kind of business. It's very competitive for the reasons you just alluded to. But the assets that we have that are unique that I think really help us here are not just leading-edge products and technologies but that distinctive contribution in terms of direct sales, in terms of partnership sales at the lower end of the market, which is slightly different in terms of self-select, but the high end of the market, those enterprise customers not just with direct sales but in multiple geographies.",1.4483986,0.011

With changing consumer preferences as a tailwind, we believe we will sustain higher levels of growth in our omnichannel businesses on an ongoing basis coming out of the pandemic as channel shift and market share gains continue.

Jeff, I just want to start off with your strategy around acquisitions and really the technologies and capabilities you really think you can use to fill out what's already obviously showing to hold up - hold its own pretty well. And then just on top of that any data points you can give us on how you're kind of filling the funnel on the top in terms of bookings new business trends in the merchant business versus any attrition levels would be great.

I'm sure Cameron and Paul can comment on your second question. But on your first question listen our strategy has not changed the company probably over the last number of years and that is to say that we have three legs to the stool. Those legs to the stool include owned and partnered software, include e-commerce and omnichannel businesses and exposure to faster growth market.

But obviously some of that depends on some stability of course in the capital markets. So you saw our announcement today about our Board thankfully increasing our share repurchase authorization.

For the end of this year we crossed that threshold in the third quarter. So I think that's been working really well for us. I don't really see that changing.

I think their performance has been very strong, notwithstanding the environment they've been operating in. New sales remain solid in all those markets. The U.K. has had some significant new wins this quarter that we're particularly pleased with. Spain continues to be a strong performer for us. Midtown is up in Spain year-over-year.

Obviously, the overall macro in Asia continues to be a bit soft given the impact of the pandemic.

I mean it sounds like - and I'll leave it at this but it sounds like overall the technology offerings you have is enabling.

We continue to track well against those synergy targets. I'm more optimistic today than I was at the beginning of the merger as it relates to our ability to drive revenue synergies from the combination. And I would say, the early success we're seeing is very positive.",0.5256228,0.962

I would characterize it as both better kind of optimization from the synergies. As we talked about, we raised our synergy target to $375 million. So we are seeing kind of better realization on the synergies front. We clearly achieved the $100 million of run rate cost takeouts relative to the pandemic, and so we're seeing that benefit come through. And just in general, as we're getting incremental revenue, the incremental margins of that revenue is coming in at a higher incremental rate than we had originally planned, because we kind of locked down the expense base.",0.0406805,0.949
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,110,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"So it's really those three drivers. I would say, as it relates to fourth quarter and the margin expansion there specifically talking about the merchant segment, when I referenced kind of the expansion there I would also say, and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the margin expansion we would have had this quarter would would've been higher had we not used some of the excess incremental revenue at the incremental margin to set aside for accrual non-executive bonuses. So, actually on a core fundamental basis margin performance was actually even better than the 250 basis points that we realized.",0.3147189,0.813

There's a lot of people trying to speculate on what deals you guys would look at. In particular, I guess I'm trying to understand your preference between a scale kind of a cost synergy versus looking at a growth asset that would supplement your growth rate or even take it higher. Just any thoughts on a preference between those two types of assets?",0.3560284,0.863

So let me just start with the criteria that, we always apply to kind of every deal, and then I'll work backwards to kind of address your question more directly. So, as you said for some time, we look at strategic fit, cultural fit and financial returns, when we look at new mergers and acquisitions very few things that we look at actually meet all three of those hurdles. And I would tell you that, we vary the financial return hurdle based on risk not surprisingly which includes geographic and country risk, and also will reflect the volatility that we see in the capital markets currently and that may or may not persist time will tell.",0.1736655,0.424

GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,117,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I'd also say another corollary coming out of what I just said is, most of our focus now in our pipeline as Paul said most of our focus now is on deals in the United States. So if you look at the criteria listed and you think about macroeconomic risk, country risk, regional risk and everything else, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that unless pricing environments drop our focus is largely within the United States market, which is about 70% of the company. So that probably shouldn't surprise anybody.",0.1733096,0.34
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,118,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"As it relates to scale versus growth assets, look our pipeline is still with both of them. What I would tell you at the end of the day though is I think it's unlikely in the immediate term that we do something outside the United States. Within the United States, we're looking at both software assets as well as traditional processing assets. But if nothing changes from here, I would expect us to do more repurchase. You should be candid at these prices, and less inorganic investment. But obviously that's subject to the facts. And as the facts change our opinions will change.",0.2295374,0.908
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,119,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The other thing, I want to mention in response to your question as Paul said is, at 2.5 times net leverage and $3 billion of liquidity we got plenty of financial firepower to do what we need to do on our own. Should we need access to additional capital, and we have a use of proceeds for it, then obviously we'll revisit the composition of our businesses. But I would say sitting here today, we think we're particularly well capitalized to execute on our strategies. I don't see us shedding in the assets to do that absent the distinct use of proceeds, which we don't have today.",0.2487544,0.526

On the Issuer Solutions business, it seems like it's trending well and came in kind of a little bit ahead of where we were looking for, just thinking about the outlook there and the pipeline and issuer, if you could make some comments there? Thanks so much.",0.093617,0.958
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,121,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah. Bryan, I'll start. I'm sure Paul can contribute also, but let me just start. So I would say, it's a real bright spot as you said sequentially pretty significant improvement, return to better growth in the third quarter ex the commercial card, which is largely corporate travel related as Paul described in his prepared remarks.",0.1373665,0.978
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,122,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Look, our pipeline is full. I think we've said in our prepared remarks, 11 deals in our pipeline. Seven of which are competitive takeaways, in the last 18 months 33 competitive wins. So, it's hard not to look at that and be really pleased with how we're executing.",0.3516014,0.86
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,123,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And some of these we mentioned initially, our AWS collaboration, which is unique to us, really starting to bear fruit. We've had our first joint win in Asia, and that's someone going competitive takeaway from someone else from a legacy provider into a cloud-based environment coming in 2021. So, now we have market validation from a customer base as to how we're doing.",0.0391459,0.671
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,124,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And our strategy there is a little bit different than everybody else is. So if you look at our strategy in Issuer, which is bearing fruit, it's to marry great technology with folks like AWS, to marry that with servicing the largest and most complex financial institutions globally.",1.5562278,0.765
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,125,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And the reason we go after that market base, and it's not to the exclusion of everything else, but the reason we go after that market -- that place in the market is that, those are the folks who are gaining share in their own right. So as they gain share we gain share with them.",0.0402135,0.974
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,126,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And I don't think you have to look further than announcements, for example, that Cap1 has made, and other folks over time about picking up additional portfolios, to see that we're successful when our partners are successful. So that's why our focus is where it is.",0.3231317,0.823
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,127,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, we're pretty optimistic in that business. Obviously some of that depends on the macro. As I think Paul pointed out in his commentary, and you look at the Visa and Mastercard numbers last night, our business was -- I mean someone can do the math, but it's six times better than the market rates to growth or whatever the math was embedded in the Visa, Mastercard commentary last night.",0.119573,0.883
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,128,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So ex T&E low-single-digit growth, with T&E in there and commercial card minus two whatever it was. But that compares to whatever they've done last time minus 7% and minus 12% or wherever the revenue was minus 14% and minus 17%. So, clearly, I think we represent the market on issuing. And I think it goes to show the length of differentiation, the unique value play that we have the value-added services like fraud analytics and loyalty in our businesses and that stuff obviously is winning.",0.5715302,0.932
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,130,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yeah. Yeah, I would just say this that, we are going to see continued growth there and the recovery with that is happening in that business is very good from a top line standpoint. I would say the other thing is the efficiencies, we're getting that business to get 500 basis points of margin expansion this quarter just speaks volumes to how we're managing the cost base in the environment we're in.",1.1464497,0.916
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,131,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And then finally, we're doing all that in an environment where we're investing in modernization as Jeff just talked about. So, really kind of hitting all three levers of the business of the growth side from the top line, the new wins, the pipeline, the cost base efficiency, and then investing to position the business for the future.",1.2366864,0.863
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,132,Question,2020-10-29,3,2020,Bryan Keane,Prudential,Got it. Thanks so much and congrats on the progress.,2.337234,0.854
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,135,Question,2020-10-29,3,2020,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the major initiatives in Europe, particularly the reestablishment of the HSBC JV and going up to 80% on la Caixa. I'm curious, why move forward on both of these initiatives now. And does control of the la Caixa JV allow you to do things that you couldn't do previously?",0.3271862,0.889
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,136,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah. Dave, it's Jeff. I'll start and I'm sure Cameron will comment as well. So listen, those businesses are both performing really well in the current environment. I think you have to parse out the nature of our business in Europe relative to the nature of the markets themselves or in particular Visa and Mastercard's proxies for the market.",0.1259786,0.772
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,137,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, our business is in those markets, which is to say, Western Europe or the U.K. and Spain and Portugal, have a very heavy domestic component in those markets. And our businesses are growing there absolutely on a domestic basis year-over-year, and I'm thinking about Caixa particularly and cross border while a piece of our business is a relatively small piece of our business and is nowhere near the driver of revenue growth that you have in Visa and Mastercard.",0.3010676,0.511
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,138,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, to answer your question from my point of view, we have fantastic partners in HSBC and Caixa. Using the networks as a proxy, we're growing leaps and bounds, ahead of where they're growing in those markets our ability to invest, and capture more share in those businesses.",0.1661922,0.869
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,139,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Cameron talked about the bookings totals in some of our markets. We've had really good results in terms of new sales in those business. Businesses well in Spain, for example, we're growing absolutely year-over-year into October on a domestic basis. So, I actually think it's a fantastic time for us to continue to invest in those businesses and support our partners.",0.124911,0.906
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,140,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. I agree with that Dave. I don't have a ton to add. I would say I don't think there's ever a bad time to extend a relationship with a partner like HSBC, someone that we've worked with over 50 years in our business in some form or fashion. And certainly for the entirety of our existence in the U.K. market, they're a fantastic partner.",0.6986301,0.813
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,141,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We have a number of initiatives from a digital engagement standpoint that align very well with what our strategy is in that market. And we've worked together extensively for years, and are delighted to have the opportunity to extend our existing relationship, and even broaden it into new avenues as we move forward in time. So, we're -- we could not be more pleased to have executed that with them.",1.0242839,0.871
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,142,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As it relates to Spain, I completely agree with Jeff's comments. Spain and Portugal are two of the most attractive domestic markets in Spain -- or excuse me, in Europe. As I mentioned previously, Spain returned to volume growth domestically in the quarter and that has continued in October even with some reintroduction of restrictions to impact or to combat the coronavirus spread. So we're delighted with the overall performance of that business.",0.7179328,0.877
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,143,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And certainly, as Caixa continues to look to expand in Spain as well through its merger with Bankia, we think there'll be incremental opportunities for us and obviously owning more of the joint venture, I think will yield better returns longer term as we think about that investment.",0.4056663,0.883
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,144,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,So clearly the valuation that underpinned and the forecast has underpinned the valuation for that business reflects the environment that we're in today. We're outperforming that valuation in that forecast as we sit here today. And again any time you have an opportunity to invest further in a joint venture that's been as successful as ours has been with Caixa in Spain certainly we jumped at the opportunity to do it.,0.7780199,0.93
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,145,Question,2020-10-29,3,2020,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Understood. Just as a quick follow-up, if I could. You made a number of important announcements both in the current quarter and previously the 11 LOIs with the financial institutions globally. You've got the AWS partnership, the Truist win which you announced earlier this year. Can you help us dimension what this might mean for 2021 or 2022 revenue or earnings growth recognizing companies aren't giving guidance in this environment, but maybe give us some framework with which to think about it?",0.3301606,0.743
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,146,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So David, this is Paul. I think we gave you a little bit of a framework to think about our thinking as it relates to 2021 with the adjusted earnings per share target that we have right now on our budgeting process of roughly $8. And so that's how we're currently thinking about next year. All of those things you just mentioned are obviously dynamics in that overall planning kind of cycle that we're in right now. But as it relates to the next year that's kind of the best indicator we can give you as to our thinking of what next year might look like assuming a much more normalized and kind of more normal operating environment.",0.2699704,0.914
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,147,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Dave, the only thing I would add to that is just I think it gives us a lot of confidence around the momentum we have in the underlying business. The macro is the macro and the impact of the virus is what it is. And obviously that will eventually play out. But as it relates to how we're executing in the business the underlying momentum we have from a new sales product and servicing standpoint, I think it just gives us a tremendous amount of confidence as to directionally where the business is heading over time. And as the macro continues the recovery obviously that will bear out in the financial results that we produce.",1.297153,0.84
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,152,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So Ashwin -- yes this is Paul. As it relates to -- we've always had as our goal to kind of convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings into free cash flow and we were right at that goal for the third quarter. As it relates to timing there's been any really unique timing items in the quarter that I point to. We always have timing things that kind of flow in and out of a quarter, but nothing that I would specifically call out.",0.7732988,0.61
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,153,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And yes as it relates to kind of the forward look we've said that kind of $1.6 billion to $2 billion run rate on a full year basis is kind of the job that we're producing against from a free cash flow standpoint. And if you look over kind of the last three quarters we're playing right in that zone. And so, it wouldn't mean anything else there. We continue to obviously manage our capital expenditures in a very efficient sort of way while still investing for growth of basic -- the initiatives that we've talked about. But there isn't anything from a unique kind of onetime standpoint than I would point to in the quarter.",0.3136095,0.91
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,155,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Yes Ashwin there isn't anything really from an overall standpoint that I would say is changing the pace of patent realization of those opportunities. Obviously each client might have a different dynamic just always -- that always happens when you're dealing with clients. But there is one theme or any kind of a particular dynamic at play of either speeding up or slowing down kind of the normalized kind of realization of being able to get those opportunities converted into revenue.,0.2189349,0.926
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,156,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,I would say from a conversion standpoint particularly on the issuing side which has the longest kind of cycle to bring those our conversion pipeline is relatively full. And so new opportunities are kind of being paced into that pipeline with that full nature. But there isn't any unique dynamic at play around acceleration or delaying of those opportunities.,0.2377959,0.868
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,163,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So Jason, obviously, we're in this budget process right now, and we obviously have always got a lot of dynamics at play, when we're in a budgeting process that kind of plays through various scenarios of what the revenue picture looks like and then, what the cost side looks like. And yes, we have obviously one set of plans as it relates to our cost initiatives. And then, under a different set of revenue assumptions, we would have a different set of plans. Do we have additional cost opportunities? The answer to that is, yes. There's always this balancing of the realization of cost opportunities with what that does on the revenue side. And all of this is kind of wrapped in the overall environment that we're operating in. And we're going to need the next obviously several months to kind of play itself out relative to the overall operating environment and we'll seek the cost base relative to that operating environment.",0.6216716,0.965
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,164,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"But yes, I mean, I wouldn't give you any more color really than that other than the state that we are in our budgeting cycle and we play through all those dynamics in every year. This is a more unique year obviously, given the pandemic and the dynamics that play with the pandemic.",0.4922337,0.866
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,165,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Jason, this is Cameron. The only thing I would add to that is it obviously assumes that the path run as it relates to recovery continues. And certainly, it doesn't anticipate a meaningful retrenchment, particularly as it relates to shutdowns or significant restrictions around commerce that we saw obviously earlier this year. So, it's not assuming heroic pace of recovery. It sort of assumes, we're continuing on the pace we're on today.",0.0656912,0.377
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,167,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. It's Jeff. Jason, the answer is no, we will not do that. So, we're very focused on our long-term model that we rearticulated and reaffirmed at the time of our partnership with TSYS about 1.5 years ago now. So, no, I don't see us doing deals that are dilutive to the rate of organic revenue growth. It doesn't make any sense to push a boulder up a further hill. I think, we've invested very substantially to get our business to be 60% technology-enabled. We're very pleased with the success of that strategy. You see in there differentiated results, which are multiples better than networks last night. I don't see us going backwards on that.",0.0701068,0.931
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,172,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. I'll start Andrew and I'm sure Cameron will comment as well. So listen, we're very pleased with our Xenial business. As you referenced, we gave additional disclosure today about how that business is performing. We did $62 million I think online orders as well as $1 billion of volume coming out of that business in the most recent period. I think Cameron commented on 30% increase in SaaS sales in that business in the most recent quarter. So, he can give you more detail, but we're very pleased about where that business is. But if you step back for a second, you tie us back the overall competitive landscape. I don't think there's anybody who's got the full stack of vertical capabilities that we do in that business.",0.5441281,0.913

So, we mentioned Dutch Bros, we mentioned Long John Silver's today in previous calls. We've mentioned RBI with Burger King, Popeyes et cetera. We've mentioned NENs and the folks that inspire our focused brands. So, we've got enormous pipeline in that business.",0.2370107,0.743
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,174,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say, it has changed a little bit and this is very good news for us and valuation of our strategy is that, in the last six months or so, we've been getting a lot of RFPs from either folks who are never customers of ours or exchange in that pipeline. And I think that's because they see what we're seeing, which is we call it the restaurant of the future, the QSR of the future, which obviously now includes safer commerce.",0.0224199,0.718
GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,175,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"But looking to RFP their payments business and these are businesses that are not with us today with competitors, who are primarily rightful shop payments companies.

And that includes both competitive takeaways, being brand-new brands and we have 26 of the top 50 a day, but we don't have all of them. So, it includes brand-new brands, but also includes guys who are customers of us just for a portion of their business. So I think that cross-sell strategy is really working and we're very fortunate to be in that position we're in. Cameron, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the sub detail?",0.4042705,0.757

I think Bryan , it's important to segment the market as we always do here particularly in restaurant maybe more than other vertical markets.

GPN-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,178,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,I will comment obviously that the integration with Cayan really opens up the avenue for cross-selling payments into that channel. I think as you know SICOM the legacy business we acquired a couple of years ago had no real payment volume in that business.

The only thing I would add to that is remember in Q4, we were impacted a little bit by the Hong Kong situation that probably was about a point of drag on that growth.

And as we said in our prepared remarks, we do have good capacity to be able to do the kind of strategic things we're wanting to do to continue the growth of the business. Obviously in our guidance, we have kind of capital deployment assumptions around various kind of scenarios.

I will start and I will ask Cameron to join in on the back part of your question as well, I would say the consumer is very healthy. I think, as Paul alluded to, in his prepared remarks, we saw continuing health through the fourth quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue into 2020. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we saw record peak volumes for us, 7 billion transactions during the peak period up high single-digits year-over-year despite the shorter holiday period.",0.6266904,0.86

We also pointed out particularly in Paul's commentary, the strength of our business in Europe, we continue to be pleased with how we're outperforming in the United Kingdom despite a more difficult macro environment there but I would say it's probably been six or seven months of that -- our performance in the UK. And of course, we remain very pleased with Erste in Continental Europe and Caixa in Spain. Cameron alluded to this in response to Dave's question a minute ago. But we do expect in the back half of 2020, our Asia-Pacific business, relative to the Hong Kong riots that we saw in the back half of 2019 to improve.",0.3686833,0.875
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,96,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So certainly we've been reporting that, ex Hong Kong for the last number of quarters, that number has been double-digits, we certainly expect to lap that in 2020 and that would certainly be an improvement over where we were. So I would say, Ashwin, we think the consumer is pretty healthy. I think our expectations heading into this year, assume that continued momentum that we had really coming out of last year that we see coming into this year. So we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive enhanced growth. Cameron, do you want to add any color?",0.7686833,0.974

North America, which is 80% of the merchant business, obviously to Jeff's point I think remains very healthy.

They continue to muddle through the Brexit process. Obviously, if you get closer to the end of the year, and the Brexit becomes more of a ""reality on the ground"" we'll see how trends continue to hold up. But as we sit here today, I think our outlook is they'll continue to maintain a reasonably stable environment, albeit not a growth environment.

I would note that Greater China is less than 2% of our combined revenues as a company. There will be some impact on the business from the coronavirus outbreak across the region, little early to tell how much of an impact that will be but given the relatively small size of that, given Global Payments as a whole, we certainly think we'll be able to absorb that and move through. And as Jeff highlighted, as you get to the back half of the year, assuming things settle out from a coronavirus standpoint, we do expect Asia to return to more normalized growth in that low double-digit range as we lap the Hong Kong protests impact from last year.",0.3960149,0.567

It's important strategically to us because we think part of a different trade strategy involves bringing our Netspend business into lesser penetrated and more attractive underlying markets outside the United States.

Today, wholesale represents about 8% of the merchant business. So a little bit less than that, obviously on a consolidated basis for Global Payments as a whole.

We have very good partners in that business and we want to continue to serve well. We will continue to support and we will continue to renew, we're not going to go out and aggressively seek to sign new sort of wholesale customers through that channel. We may sign a few new and select circumstances. But I think by and large, our strategy is to continue to maintain that business largely as it is, it's roughly a flattish kind of growth business for us going forward and we will continue to really focus most of our energy around our direct distribution channels which we have a plethora of good opportunities clearly in the U.S. market as a combined business that Jeff talked about in his script.",0.2798879,0.945

I would say and as we said before, I think ongoing consolidation; we think it's something that provides further validation really of the strategy that we've had and have adopted over many years. So no, that's surprise a stuff we certainly thought heavily about and I think just reinforces that competitive position we're in. As Paul mentioned a few minutes ago, I think given our balance sheet and our leverage levels coming out of the partnership with TSYS, I think we're as well-positioned as we have or have been to think about more transactions, I think the gating item for us really has been how do we feel about the integration with TSYS. I would say as you've heard us now on this call, and also last quarter, having raised our estimates twice on the expense side and obviously can adjust for yourself the quality of the operating performance I think is very good today. And our guidance, I think, is great. I think we feel really good about kind of where we are heading into 2020.",0.394306,0.945
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,107,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So our pipeline is full. It's full of a variety of types of transactions, other large or naturally large consolidations, software-related businesses, et cetera. As always, we're pursuing everything to see where we think the right angle is for shareholder value creation.

But twice a year at least, about twice a year usually in October as you know, the networks change, interchange related pricing if not more often than that. So that's something we expect in our management of the business and that's true globally for us. So really, that's not a surprise.",0.2498221,0.53
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,110,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"As we said before any change, interchange pricing is good for us as a company we prefer of course it to go down at the margin because that's better for our customers or merchants but at the end of the day, we provide value-added services and the more complexity and the more value we can provide, it's just better for us over time.",0.2932384,0.883
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,111,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say as it relates to adjustments in pricing before I turn it over to Cameron, any pricing action that we would ever say, and Paul used to say this too, when he was running that company, it's a very efficient competitive market will be competed away over time, at the end of the day, and those are obviously very transparent. So I think this is kind of nothing new for us. It's something we see all the time in our markets around the world. So as I mentioned, this is all good news in the scheme of things. We of course prefer prices to our customers to come down. But it's not something that's unexpected from us; it's obviously something we're very well prepared to accommodate. Cameron, do you want to talk a little bit on pricing trends in Merchants?",0.7405694,0.897
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,112,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. I would say pricing trends kind of across the board are relatively stable. I think we continue to see a strong market for our offerings. And I think our model of providing what we believe to be a superior level of product service capability to our customers allows us to get paid fairly for delivering those services. And to Jeff's point earlier, our ability to continue to drive more value-added services and deliver more innovative capabilities to our product is only providing more of a tailwind for us to be able to maintain a stable pricing environment across the core part of the processing solutions that we deliver. So I think we feel very good about how we're positioned in the market. And I think the overall pricing behavior in the market continues to be relatively rational. We're not seeing a lot of sort of irrational behavior in the marketplace which is certainly comforting as well.",0.5,0.977

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And just lastly on Jeff's point, as it relates to changes in interchange or scheme fees we see these all the time; this is a part of running the business. We're not in the business of absorbing those and obviously anytime these are MasterCard or any of the networks make a change, we have work that we have to do to accommodate that and to be able to pass out along to our customers. And obviously we look to do that in a very efficient way. But obviously, we're not in the business of absorbing that in our different businesses around the globe.

GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,117,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"On the first part, I would say broadly across really operating environments and technology. I think most of the corporate overhead savings and public company expenses that we expected to realize, I think we remain very much on track with our initial estimates there. I think as we continue to align operating environments, we continue to work through our technology architecture and make decisions about what we want future state technology environment to be for the merchant business specifically. Obviously, I think we've been able to find more opportunities to rationalize expenses and improve upon the original estimates that we have for cost synergies from the transaction. So having just them today another 25 it's a little premature to talk about future upside to that new raised number. But obviously, we're working very hard to make sure that we deliver on the commitments that we've already made. And obviously to the extent that we can do better than that, we will.",0.2506227,0.914

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"The last point I would make on that and I would more call this a reminder relative to what we talked about when we announced the transactions. Our synergies have been designed to ensure that we do a couple of things. One is position the business for success long-term; two, realize the value that we saw in the transaction, combining the new companies; and three, most importantly, not disrupt the momentum in the business. So we've been very careful as we're making these decisions that we don't disrupt the strong momentum and the strong growth we're seeing in the merchant business in particular. So we're very cautious as we think about taking costs out of the business to ensure that we don't do that.",0.0600872,0.968

So we're going to take the actions we're going to take over the next three years, but I think even beyond that, we'll have a lot of opportunities, continue to scale the business, drive sustainable margin expansion for the long-term.

On the expense side, you heard us on the last call talk about $100 million that we've already actioned on the expense side. So fully obviously, that's fully baked into the guidance and we have obviously actioned more than that are going to and are going to continue to action throughout the year additional items and so those will be coming in as the year progresses.

So I'm sure there additional geographies we can go in because we're currently physically in 38 countries as a combined company and cross border in a 100. So 100 is not all the countries but in terms of Global Payments, and where we sit today as a company, UCP is live in every one of them.

I think we mentioned this on the previous call, we're up and running with a number of customers say particularly overseas on UCP. And the feedback has been really good. I think we've mentioned plenty of time in the last call, a number of those wins.

In particular in Spain, in Russia, in Canada, in terms of our e-commerce growth. Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks, our omnichannel business in Asia-Pacific which grew 30% in the fourth quarter year-over-year.

We feel really good as I said in the prepared remarks about where we are on the revenue synergies. Part of the reason we didn't increase them on now, as Paul mentioned just in response to Steven's question is by nature, those tend to be long dated. So whereas expense synergies as Cameron alluded to the detail archive in front of us right now and easier to quantify time and fee, obviously revenue takes time to kind of come in, so that really get to the 125 and how we're thinking that.",0.1412811,0.898
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,129,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"But I would say as it relates to that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're starting to book those this year. So I gave a few examples that selling Vital POS into the Heartland base, I think we said in the call is going to be in the second quarter, which obviously is in like six weeks. So that's near data. Selling the Paycard into the -- from my Netspend into the Heartland, into the Heartland base also I think tied to the second quarter towards back half of the year, selling the Legacy Xenial Global Payments, data and analytics and customer engagement platform into the TSYS base. So those are things that will be realized throughout the year.",0.3658363,0.823
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,130,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We also have made significant progress in what we'll call transaction optimization, which is finding ways to marry as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the issuing and acquiring benefits. We have active ongoing discussions with multiple large corporations primarily outside the United States, in Europe, and in Canada about ways to match issuing and acquiring and to provide more efficiencies in terms of customer engagement costs, data analytics, and reporting together. We've made a ton of progress on that, since our last call in October, but of course those two remains long dated, because that will take time, that will take time to do.",0.0946619,0.899
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,131,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I'd also say, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Global Payments acquiring outside of the United States where TSYS did not have a business in merchant before the merger also is making a lot of headway in signing new customers on competitive takeaways from other providers because TSYS was not in that business overseas. So I would say Glenn, we feel very confident and clear line of sight into the 125. We'll obviously revisit upping that in the future. But those are long dated and do take some time. And that plays into our thinking as to what the timing is.",0.5854093,0.915

So when you blend that together that's the overall kind of growth underpinning behind the 8% to 9% guidance that we gave and obviously at the beginning of the year, we're a little bit lower and at the end of the year, we end up more at the higher end of the range.",0.4219675,0.148

So just a follow-up on the revenue synergies, we have had some feedback from the industry that you guys have had some early successes around Vital and Genius being I think you mentioned Jeff being cross sold through the Heartland and the OpenEdge platforms. I just I'd be curious to hear where you believe you are like, is it actually where's the sales process in that now? Are the -- are your people actually selling it already? Is it -- how's it been going so far? What kind of ramp do you expect on that, it seems like a competitive opportunity versus the others that have done well like Clovers and others. And then just curious what the attrition and price points you can get for those versus your current levels?",0.6013427,0.976

I will start here and then ask Jeff and Paul to jump into that anything they want to add. You're right; we have had some early success. We're rolling Vital out through the Heartland distribution channel as we said on the call actually in early March, that'll be the launching of it. And we do expect that obviously to continue to position our direct distribution relationship led channel in the U.S., very well competitively in the marketplace, we think Vital is a terrific solution. We think it obviously competes very well for that register replacement, part of the POS market as specialty POS solution. We think its capabilities are robust. And our team is delighted to have the opportunity to sell that. We're rolling it out at our Diamond Conference the first week of March and they'll be in the market selling it thereafter.",0.1674969,0.984

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"On the integrated side we've had really good success thus far, really with Genius integrated into the OpenEdge, the legacy OpenEdge environment. We have two new partner wins that I think we would have a good shot at winning on our own but certainly the combined capabilities of Genius with our integrated solutions put us over the top with two large partners that we're very excited about. We're exchanging contracts now and expect those to be done here shortly. And we'll obviously look to ramp those up as we get into the back half of 2020, but very excited about the prospects of being able to leverage Genius across the integrated business to drive new wins on that front.",0.1780822,0.982
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,140,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"The other thing we're particularly excited about already supporting Legacy TSYS integrated partners in Canada. So we've already been able to turn that on for them and obviously look to be able to expand that into other markets internationally that TSYS historically didn't have the opportunity to do, just given the footprint of their merchant business was in the U.S.",0.0136986,0.866

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And then the last thing I would highlight that we're particularly excited about, and we've already seen some early, early wins coming out of this and Jeff highlighted it in his script as well is the ability to leverage the capabilities of Propay across both our integrated business as well as our relationship led business has already led to some early success. And obviously we expect to see that ramp over the course of the year.",0.0744085,0.952
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,142,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"To the second part of your question, I would just simply say and this reflects a little bit on the comments I made earlier, when we can add more value around the transaction, when we can deliver more innovative technological capabilities whether it's Genius integrated into or integrated environment, or Propay being used as a dispersement engine or self-select onboarding engine leveraging those capabilities, selling Vital as a POS solution allows us to add more value to our customers, allows us to get paid and continue to be paid fairly and appropriately for the level of innovation product service, we're delivering to them. So it creates a nice tailwind and obviously is very important in terms of our ability to continue to drive sustained growth in the merchant business at the levels we're targeting.",0.1709215,0.975

Just quick follow-up Jeff on Netspend or the Legacy Netspend business consumer business, I mean just any updated thoughts on your strategic process going forward, I mean is it going as well as you would have thought that you'd want to keep it and keep cross selling synergy, do you have any other thoughts about the business? Thanks.",0.6847826,0.906

I think we said this on the October call that we expected to see improvement and in fact, we did to flattish in the fourth quarter, of course, down here in the first quarter as Paul mentioned, we're about to anniversary starting in the second quarter the CFPB action, and I think we have two strategies that are differentiators for that business. The first is to expand overseas, our partnership with Caixa which we're always looking to extend in any direction we can, I think successfully position that for that success heading into the middle of the year, as Paul described and the second one is to go deeper into B2B.",0.4982206,0.939
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,145,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And we mentioned that Paycard wins that we've had with top bank overlaps through times. So certainly, I would say Darrin consistent with our expectations as to where the business want to be. But I've also said over time, as it relates to all of our businesses, not specific to Netspend, we're here to maximize value for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So every one of our businesses needs to be sort out in that context, that is exactly what we're doing right now with Netspend. So we think we have a differentiated strategy. Obviously, we said those things all the time, and if at some point facts change, then we will change with the facts.",0.2850534,0.872
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,148,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Jason. So yes, it is on a combined basis. So it's on a like-for-like basis, we obviously are getting some small benefit as it relates to the Desjardins portfolio, but that's relatively small and obviously, there's some other impacts obviously that are playing through. But the way to think about it really is if you -- going back to what I said earlier around the components, each one of the businesses from a fundamental standpoint is growing once we anniversary these two items in the first quarter are growing at those established kind of long-term expectation growth rates.",0.3627024,0.911
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,149,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And so while the math is kind of 8% to 9% for this year, the key message is each one of those businesses and you're going to see this in the back half of the year are performing exactly in line with those kind of long-term established growth rates that we've had for the business.",0.23599,0.382
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,151,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Sure, yes. So we had about 100 basis point acceleration in issuer in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter on kind of a like-for-like basis. So it's exactly the kind of acceleration that we talked about on our last call, I would say that if you kind of took out the governmental headwind and also this one product, you kind of layer that on top of that 3.5%, you get squarely back in that mid-single-digit growth range, we talked about this business. So that kind of underlies the fundamental growth rate that we look at when we're managing the business.",0.135741,0.875

Maybe just two points of clarification if we look at the fourth quarter 2019 performance, firstly on a year-over-year pro forma basis, was the growth rate roughly 7% and then you're talking about the 7% accelerating to 8% to 9% in 2020. And then if we sort of disaggregate the Merchant Solutions business, to the extent we can by Legacy Global and TSYS is the right way to think about it, that Legacy Global grew in the low double-digits and TSYS sort of in the mid-single-digits?",0.14375,0.778
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,155,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes, so I'll start and then Cameron you may want to add or as it relates to the overall kind of merchant growth. So as it relates to fourth quarter, yet George that's about the right range, that kind of seven percent-ish is pretty close on a pure kind of apples-to-apples basis. And so you would also want to think about that growth rate being somewhat similar, just like we said in our prepared remarks for the first quarter and then accelerating meaningfully throughout the year. I just say that is a high single-digit growth rate for the merchant business. And then these two kind of headwind growth rates as it relates to the other two businesses.",0.1616124,0.959
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,156,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"As it relates to kind of margin expansion also we did get good margin expansion in the fourth quarter on an apples-to-apples basis. And I said in our prepared remarks, we exceeded our margin expectation substantially in the fourth quarter. And that gives us nice tailwind for the annual margin expansion that we expect on a go-forward basis for 2020. Cameron, you want to give color on the Legacy Merchant side?",0.6113166,0.785
GPN-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,157,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, George this is Cameron. So obviously, we've combined the business. So it's hard to get a very clear definitive view of what Legacy Global was versus Legacy TSYS. But what I would say is, if you look at the Legacy Global business, obviously, on a constant currency basis, and excluding Hong Kong, which was about a point of headwind, we were in that low double-digit growth range, which is very consistent with what we saw throughout the course of 2019. So I would just say more of the same really on the Legacy Global side with Hong Kong being a little bit of a headwind in the quarter as we talked about previously.",0.9087796,0.661

So when you blend that together, I think you get a high single-digit rate for the merchant business, which is a jumping off point heading into 2020, which we feel very good about and then accelerating through the course of the year as we begin to realize synergies within the merchant business.",0.2817559,0.493

And then just one quick follow-up, Jeff, any more color on the M&A pipeline, maybe to be more specific? Is it software, more traditional assets?

It's a mix of software asset; it's a mix of other merchant and processing asset. I would say for the time being a lot of stuff is outside the United States that's just kind of where it is, but some stuff particularly in the software side is more likely to be inside the United States, because of larger targets in software more likely inside the United States than outside, so but I would say we have full pipeline and we're kind of looking everything.",0.0039146,0.898

I think we called it out in the prepared remarks, despite some acquisition a year-and-a-half ago has been really Grand Slam for us, we of course now call it Xenial, which was the old part of the name of the Heartland business is done terrifically well for us. So whilst we're at scale in that business obviously we're at scale in that business you'd like to do more, so more scale is a good thing. But I would also say though, I think part of the rationale but behind this icon deal was that we wanted to be end-to-end vertically integrated from the front to the middle to the back of house with payments, but also with hardware, software and data analytics and everything else.",0.3505338,0.796

We've invested about $50 million in capital in Xenial more broadly after the acquisition of SICOM but including the pro forma company in the last period of years compared to some of our competitors who spent $0.5 billion we are in 400 locations operating today, which is what I said in our prepared remarks.

From the outset, the goal of our integration has been to ensure of frictionless combination of the two businesses. Building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually. Although we are still early in the process, we could not be more pleased with the progress we have made.

Can you quantify that and the currency headwinds in the quarter? And then is the outlook for margins to stay basically sequentially similar in the second quarter and then improve in the second half? And if it improves in the second half, what drives that? Thanks so much.",1.0656028,0.909

I will start and then ask either Jeff or David to add any other thoughts they may have. So, I would say in the first quarter, the margin declines in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated, and if you look at the two primary drivers one being Erste integration efforts, specifically around Erste joint venture and the second being currencies, say probably each contributed about half of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe that 450 basis points in the first quarter.",0.4392902,0.727
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,38,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So about half and half coming from our Erste and currency. I think as you work through the year, I would expect that to get progressively a little bit better. Some of the FX headwind will begin to update as we get into the back half of the year, and as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time we get to Q4 sitting here today, I would anticipate we'd be back to flat to extending margins in Europe, which as we've talked in the past with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to stay in that level of margin not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment.",0.2742839,0.635

I would just add to what Cameron said that as we mentioned in our release, our businesses in Europe performed exceptionally well this quarter. Our UK business accelerated its revenue growth into double-digit you may also recall that Spain has now double annualized the interchange reduction as of September 1. So going forward to Cameron's point, we expect to see continued growth in revenue profitability in our Spanish business, which has been a bit of a headwind over the last 12 months.",0.2626335,0.827

And just a quick follow-up, on the synergies from Heartland, I think you guys increased those $10 million for this fiscal year. Just to clarify, is that just a pull forward from the total run rate of synergies or is that an additional increase in synergies for what you think you're getting out of Heartland, and maybe what is causing the pull forward?

So, I would say as it relates to the expense synergies themselves what we are really seeing as far as an acceleration of our plan so we are realizing synergies in fiscal 2017 more quickly than we otherwise anticipated that we could. I think it is a little pre-mature to suggest that the overall run rate, the full expected run rate synergy that we expect from the merger will be higher than the target we provided when we announced the deal last December, but I would say obviously the progress we are making gives us a tremendous amount of confidence that we have the right momentum towards achieving that target and potentially exceeding it over time.",0.2310087,0.899
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,48,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes Ashwin, it is Cameron. I will jump in and I will just note, we had little trouble hearing you, I think you are asking about the revenue guide and why the revenue guide perhaps wasn't increased in the quarter, I think inherently you can think of it as a increase because we are now forecasting more FX headwind than we were when we guided in July, So, I think you can essentially look at it as an implicit increase. We are observing more FX headwind on the topline yet maintaining that overall revenue guidance at 3.2 billion to 3.3 billion. We did obviously increase our expectation around margin expansion for the full year as well, which is driving obviously the increase in earnings per share guidance as well. So, I think we do see obviously revenue tracking ahead of what we would have anticipated, but we are also currently forecasting more FX headwind that we were back, it implies the short answer.",0.393213,0.79

We are beginning to see real progress and tangible progress in Canada. We got the full rollout now and integrated solutions there. We actually have signed new partners for building the pipeline. So, what I would say to you is we really feel good about the season we are planning to accelerate revenue growth in Canada. We expect to see the benefit of that really this year and certainly in calendar 2017 we begin to see some of those trends stand upward in our favor.",0.9610605,0.973

You started the year with the revenue growth rate of 52%, the upper end of the 47% to 52% that you guided to. And then I would think the comparisons, as we go to 2Q and 3Q, get a little bit easier year-over-year than what you had in the first quarter. Is there any reason why at least over the next two quarters, the revenue growth rate shouldn't increase from the 52%?",0.8697368,0.946

I would remind you that when we get to Q4, we obviously are going to annualize Heartland or part of Q4 so naturally the growth rate in Q4 is not going to be at that 47% to 52%, but I think it is fair to say as you look at Q2 and Q3 you need to factor in currencies. I'll remind you of that, but the comps are easy relative to Q1, but I think your overall thesis is correct as it relates to slide acceleration of revenue growth in those two quarters relative to what we saw in Q1.",0.3430884,0.926

I think you had said, at least on a pro forma basis, the direct North America business or direct US business was up high singles again, which is what you guided to for the year. Did you break that out for what the legacy GPN business was before Heartland? And maybe you could size the Heartland contribution in revenue for us for the quarter. Thank you.",0.1901316,0.818

We did note that the US direct businesses grew high single digits this quarter in line with our expectations including Heartland of course on a normalized basis. Breaking out the component I would say is a little more difficult, not really feasible, you know by virtue of the fact that we are combining these businesses and as more time progresses the more difficult it is going to be to look at the business in the US in particular and say what was legacy Heartland and what was legacy Global Payment.",0.4234122,0.416
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,59,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As we talked about on the call we have already combined our direct sales forces in the US market, so where do I attribute that growth that is being driven by the combination of our direct sales forces. We combined our traditional book with Heartland's direct book, so it is a little difficult to say specifically what Heartland drove in the quarter versus what Global Payments drove. We did however achieve the overall expectation we have for the business which is growing our U.S. direct sales in that high single digit range which we were obviously very pleased with while also continuing to make progress on and progressing some of the revenue enhancements and revenue synergies we expect to achieve over time.",0.1298257,0.796

I will get some overall cover and I think Cameron and David can provide some additional detail. So as we said in our prepared commentary Heartland had one of its best sales months ever in August in terms of sales moment and that is a continuation of the trends that I think we talked about in our July call as we talk about our outlook for fiscal 2017. So I say sitting here since we announced the deal in December 20015 and closed in April of 2016 the opportunities we've had to talk to you guys twice about it Heartland has only accelerated that growth as it relates to new sales over that period. I would say in terms of the health of the merchant base at Heartland that their attrition is running low relative to their own expectations and our expectations going into the deal as well. So, as Cameron mentioned in his remarks our ability to accelerate their growth minimize any merchant or sales rep disruption while taking the defense action that we have taken in a combined basis is something that we are particularly pleased about my way of background.",0.4281139,0.947

We see good momentum in those businesses, we like those businesses a great deal. The vertical specific approach that they have through those channels aligns well with our integrator strategy we believe and remain very excited about the performance of those business. And lastly, payroll also performed very well in the quarter. We continue to see good momentum utilized Heartland sales force to be able to cross sell payroll solutions across the customer base and into new customers going forward.

When we think about running the business, we are running one business in the United States right now. So the answer Cameron gave earlier is exactly the way we are managing the business. We have one US sales force for general payment and it is off to a fantastic start post the acquisition that Cameron correctly said, payroll is accelerating. The payments are accelerating, the additional products are accelerating, but the other products, the other business units are having record sales as well, whether it is campus solution, school solutions where we just had the fastest growing back to school season in Heartland history. All those things operating well, executing well, despite as you might imagine what can be a tumultuous time around synergy and integration of raw. The businesses are focused.

Sort of the balance of sales productivity, product investment synergies, we are really fortunate in a couple of way, one is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company by creating leverage, getting on common platforms and taking that capital that result and benefit and pouring it into product and distribution that is exactly the calculus we are really running everyday when we think about where to go from here. So, I will give you a couple of examples.

You can do both of at once. For example, we boarded the first Heartland merchant to a Global Payments. That took a fair amount of technology investment, it puts us well ahead of having new platform migration. Makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so that allows the Heartland sales force to give to be that much more productive.",0.8371997,0.777

All these things can now be sold by that 1500% sales force.

Beyond even that we are making little investments like accelerating sales hires. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal that's conscious. We're filling in wide space that were uncovered. That's the choice we made Global Payments with the Heartland sales leadership team and an opportunity to invest a little early and what can become nice calendar 2017 sales in areas really underserve by our combined sales forces to date.",0.0211268,0.752

In fact we've automated the sales process with Canada and as you might imagine that's a likely place for a lot of volume to come over time. So, we really feel good about the way we're putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model while being able in parallel to keep driving our synergies and not in any way into great customer service.

I think David gave a very wholesome answer as it relates to qualitatively what we've been doing to drive revenue enhancements across our US businesses. The thing that I would add is, sitting here today, it is important to note that the new enhancements we've achieved thus far they are helpful on the margin, but they are not as significant enough to really move the needle as of yet.",0.0719178,0.106

So $30 million or $60 million or so. It is going to take some time to scale these. As you talk about combining distribution platforms combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities to cross-sell products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business, it is going to take time to scale that to a point where you are seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancement that is actually on our performance.",0.6503736,0.941

I think is that is exactly the summary that drives our strategy and integration and we think Steven about how to go after the synergies. Certainly my expectation to get out of the timeframe Cameron is talk about is will be at the high end of those and we are certainly shooting to beat that rate. In addition to the direct sales synergies the real strategy that we think about Heartland combined with Global Payments is going all the way across all of the Heartland Global assets figuring out how to combine the best of both and then globalize everything.,0.8189727,0.866

In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier we are doing the same thing with campus solution. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers campus solutions is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada. That means we can sell net new customers, we can go back with TouchNet's existing customer base and sell merchants on payments from Global Payments and we are beginning to build that pipeline, that same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico.

We just certified our retail point-of-sale solution for Canada. Again for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios, we can look to migrate those for our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We are working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that.

GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,89,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think it is. If you think about the cycle guidance that we provided historically Andrew, the high single digit rate of organic growth, that's obviously what we believe this business can produce over time. With North America now being 75% of the business, if this is not growing near that level, it's going to be very difficult for the overall company to grow at that level. So, I think it's fair to say that is our goal as we think about our North American business more broadly. That doesn't mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expected to be which it is a low single digit grower in local currency, hopefully Canadian dollar headwind will abate here at some point, but we do believe as we continue to obviously progress the combination of Heartland and Global Payments in the US with North America should accelerate towards that level allowing the overall company to achieve the high single digit rate of organic net revenue growth that we expect to achieve over the cycle.",0.116127,0.833

They are actually coexisting beautifully right now. In fact they're working directly together our go to market strategy, particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I'd remind you that when we look at volume look at verticals. Less than 5%, it's really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get in Heartland Commerce. That is because Heartland Commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality, there is very little restaurant and very little hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISP working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go forward global payments.",0.9225352,0.832
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,92,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"It allows OpenEdge to continue to focusing on what it does best, which is managing that ecosystem between ISPs and end merchants working on the targeted marketing that sales adding new partners while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I would also say OpenEdge still is in the same position it was a year after, several years of mid-teens growth really successful growth. We've got lots of opportunities inside the existing partner base. So, we've got a nice little wall like a metaphor right now Andrew between the markets served really by commerce and the commerce asset and the markets served by OpenEdge. As we bring more and more Cloud Technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and again chase some of the big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well.",0.8782104,0.986

You know the $3.75 to $4 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2016 was really designed to help you guys in the market in general with the transition to a new calendar year, but we're not specifically updating that today. We are naturally updating our fiscal 2017 guide, as you correctly stated raising that from $3.40 to $3.50 to our current $3.45 to $3.55. So I think that obviously suggests very good momentum as we are going into calendar 2017. You can draw your own conclusion from that. I think the one obviously I think we continue to have wrapped with this FX headwind. And as I suggested on the call today, we believe in that guide in that race guide on cash earnings per share - adjusted earnings per share that we were going to be observing more FX headwind in those results. So, as we get to calendar 2017, early calendar 2017 we will provide a guide for 2017 that obviously reflects our expectation for the business, as well is what we think the obviously FX impacts will be for the calendar period.",0.3066625,0.942
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,99,Question,2016-10-05,1,2017,Paul Condra,BMO Capital Markets,"Okay. Thanks. And then on the OpenEdge business, I think you had talked about it today being a mid-teens grower. And in the past, you've mentioned mid to high teens. So can you clarify, is there any change in trajectory there or anything you're seeing?",0.2598146,0.586
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,100,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I would say no. There is no real change in trajectory depending on the quarter kind of bounces around between mid and high. As we think about the business, our expectation is that business continues to grow in the mid-teens level. We go very good about the momentum and the trajectory to be able to do that, but from one quarter to the next it maybe high teens, it maybe midteens, but generally in that ballpark is what our expectation is for the business. So, I will tell you for Q1 it performed exactly in line with our expectations and has accelerated relative to Q4, which I think are both very good points of empahsis.",0.5052927,0.635

GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,105,Question,2016-10-05,1,2017,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if you could comment more broadly on the impact of interchange caps that went into effect in Europe on December 9 of last year. In particular, is there the potential for an increase in merchant acceptance of electronic payments, as the cost of payments have come down?",0.3700178,0.866
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,106,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes David it's Jeff. So, as we said in our remarks this morning, our European businesses and in particular our UK business has performed exceptionally well during the quarter. So, certainly we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance, as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think, we said over time, reductions in costs to our merchants are really nothing, but good news for our business, but those ultimately get competed away over a period of time.",2.2024911,0.893
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,107,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I think, it's good news as their bills go down, the market tends to be efficient over a period of time. So our benefit as time goes on tends to get competed away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had - they had previously. It's hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we're in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which really adopted the interchange reduction.",1.1135231,0.938
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,108,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Here we are now two years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reduction and our business has grown, as we said in our prepared remarks probably one-and-a-half to two times the rate of market growth for each of the last six quarters. How much of that is attributable to the lower cost of acceptance, the fantastic partner we have in Caixa in the Spanish market, is kind of hard to disaggregate. But I think there's no doubt, David, that around the world lower cost of acceptance for our customers is really nothing but a good thing.",1.5185053,-0.215
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,109,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think too, David, this is David, I'd add in the more developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe, we're beginning to penetrate with our Erste joint venture, you will find that cost of acceptance being a enhancement, certainly to organic and secular growth in those markets.",1.3831814,0.791
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,110,Question,2016-10-05,1,2017,David Togut,Evercore ISI,"Okay, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, Jeff, I'm wondering what your thoughts are longer-term about Europe. As the banks see pressure from the reduction in interchange, do you see opportunities perhaps over time to acquire some merchant portfolios in Europe as a result?",0.856633,0.586
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,111,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Hey, David, absolutely. So, as we said in our remarks this morning, we're very pleased with the initial progress in our Erste joint venture, which encompasses a number of countries in Continental Europe. I do believe that part of the rationale on behalf of Erste Bank for considering a joint venture was a change in competitive and technology dynamics in the markets in which they're in, in Continental Europe.",1.0850534,0.844
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,112,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So we certainly continue to pursue other venture partners in Europe. I think that these number of technological and market-based changes that you're seeing going around Europe today do nothing, but help our ability to create value for our partners. I think we've been able to show over a very long period of time in many markets how we've been able to create very good returns for our shareholders and our partners. And I think, the changes in Europe provide us another opportunity to do the same. And we expect that our partners at Erste will be similarly happy.",1.3654804,0.974
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,113,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So from that point of view, David, we continue to pursue those ventures and we hope to do more in the future.",1.5548043,0.44

GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,118,Question,2016-10-05,1,2017,Robert Napoli,Piper Jaffray,"Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, the - Jeff, you highlighted right upfront and you talked about accelerating growth in all of your markets. And we've had very mixed retail data out of the U.S. Asia, I think getting mixed reports on the economic trends there. What is - and you talk about some of your products, and I understand that some of the acceleration. But do you feel this acceleration is driven - are you - do you think some of it is economic improvement? I mean, your acceleration in growth seems out of place with what generally seems to be reported out of retail sales and economic growth in the markets you serve?",0.6088803,0.911
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,119,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Bob, it's a great question. So what I would say is, I really think it's a combination of attacking the right markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, the United States is a good example, as David alluded to, we're very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it, sort of David's response about, for example, on OpenEdge and the integrated vertical markets, we're selling technology solutions into markets that themselves like dental, veterinary, et cetera, that are higher growth in the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce, and we're doing it with better technology, better people, better services, and ultimately, therefore better markets.",0.7081851,0.977
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,120,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I think, Bob, it's perhaps a reflection of the way we go about the markets that we go about, how we attack them, and our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the incremental rate of growth. I'd also stated, there's an element at very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we have yet to really laugh some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter for our fiscal last year in Asia yet business as usual Asian markets for us accelerated their growth, as Cameron and I each noted.",0.4120996,0.891
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,121,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"In Canada, I just think think that's very good sales execution in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines of with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we've made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth than the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends. That's why I think you're seeing our results. Conversely, we are really not in the large merchant category, for example, in the United States as some of our peers are, I think a lot of the data Bob that you're referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market which in general is not a market we're particularly focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland.",0.5042705,0.96
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,122,Question,2016-10-05,1,2017,Robert Napoli,Piper Jaffray,"Great. Thank you. And my follow-up question is, I mean, Global and the industry as a whole, or some of your competitors have had a great run since 2013, in particular. What is - how - what is - what are you most worried about as far as disrupting the strong trends that you've had? How sustainable are the trends that we've seen? What are you most worried about that could derail the very strong trends we've seen? Is it competition? Is it regulation?",0.8648649,0.92
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,123,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Bob, it's Jeff. So, I'll start and ask David and Cameron to join in as well. But I think, we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked. But I think what you're seeing is results of the curative investments that we've made in our business over a period of time that is really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments made in sales in Heartland, in legacy Global Payments that really results of dividend, not just in the United States, that would wrap it around the world the investments we've made in our technology environment in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 are really bearing fruit.",0.3533808,0.9
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,124,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, from that point of view, I think, we're differentiated bit in terms of where we played chips on the table. In terms of what we're worried about, I think it all starts with for us and our peers of industry, what is the macroeconomic environment look like. Most of us are GDP plus derivative type businesses and therefore, it's important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of this 2016 in Asia, where for a number of quarters, the latter three quarters of fiscal 2016, we had a headwind in greater China. I think we've been able to show throughout fiscal 2016 and our results now in 2017, our guidance show, they were able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve margin and reposition our business quickly.",0.1868327,0.84
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,125,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So there's no doubt at the end of the day, that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So, I think it's important in terms of what we worry about a healthy economic environment for us globally continue to grow that as businesses. We also need to make the right decisions around technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invested now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now, it's important to get those things right.",0.0252669,0.168
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,126,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about, we think the wrong hit in the wrong place at the table, such that we've made investments that haven't borne fruit, half way that's not the case. So, we worry a lot at the strategies matter about, whether those are the right investments to make today for returns in the future.",0.3113879,-0.93
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,127,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think that's right. I think, I'd add to that technology investment. Are we really helping our customers do what they need to do with their consumer. So those investments are right investments as we go deeper in the software. We believe they absolutely are the bearing fruit today. But we're thinking about those is the right way to think about servicing customers, allowing them to take care and to like their consumers at the point of interaction and point of sale. And obviously, in our industry, you're always worried about security.",0.7738194,0.812
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,128,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We do believe that the combination of EMV, encryption tokenization is great for overall health of the industry overall consumer confidence. When you go back to a secular question that we're talking about earlier, I think, Paul's question maybe with David's around adoption and things like that, obviously, security is a big piece of that. We invest heavily there. We're trying to find the right balance as well as returns. So, we think about those couple of things, in addition to what Jeff described.",1.1085336,0.925

It's Cameron with one final comment on the same topic, it's a little bit different. I do think we've got a great run over the last three years, of course, and that's been borne out by obviously how the share prices performed. I think it's very fair to say sitting here today, we remain - this is enthusiastic if not more so about the future over the next several years of this business.",0.2250934,0.93
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,131,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Obviously, the combination of Heartland is the transformational opportunity for us. But we think our ability to drive high rates of organic revenue growth in the business to expand margins and compound double-digit mid-teens growth in earnings per share obviously creates a very nice trajectory for the business and give us a lot of optimism about, where we're heading as a company financially.",0.3546077,0.966
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,136,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Dan, it's Jeff. So I'll start with that. So our bogie in most of the markets that we're in is, where are Visa and MasterCard growing transactionally. That's one way of getting at rate of market growth. But those markets that we're in, not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in. But where it's relevant for us, what's the rate of transaction growth, number one, number two. What is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means.",0.6323843,0.872
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,137,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So if you distill that, and there's obviously a lot of markets that we're in, we're in 30 countries physically today around the world. What you would say in general across all of our markets, the bogie is around 5% market rate of growth. Some are higher, some are lower, but in general, it's around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single-digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera.",0.0992883,0.791
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,138,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So the way we think about it, Dan, is if we're targeting high single-digit, if the rate of market growth is 5, when we talked about this last year, last October, in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we're capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is, because we're in better markets. Some of that is, because we think we have a differentiated sales force. Some of that is, because we think we have state-of-the-art operating environments, et cetera. But nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we're capturing share.",0.1103203,0.883
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,139,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"If you look at United States, for example, and our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described today mid-teens growth is probably three times the rate of mid single-digit market rate growth more broadly speaking transactionally in the United States. Now, we're not the only people growing at that rate, at the end of the day.",0.2932384,0.889
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,140,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I don't think it's just us. But certainly, I think, traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at mid-teens. And I certainly think it's fair to say that there's market share gain in a technology-enabled distribution area, whether it's Heartland commerce or whether it's OpenEdge relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institution channel, we see rates of growth that tends to be less than the market, call it around low single-digit.",0.0469751,0.893
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,141,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I think it's been a conscious effort to think about what the market is in each market that we're in, what the bogies are, how we're going to invest and grow at rates that are north of the market for a lot of reasons.

I think we feel very good about the momentum we have in Asia sitting here today. So I don't expect a lot different in the back three quarters of the year. I wouldn't say, our overall target for Asia is kind of high single to low double. Obviously, we're able to get the low double this quarter. I don't know that I would expect that every single quarter.

Just wanted to dig more into the strong Heartland sales in August and the quarter, just maybe focusing more on core merchant sales. Just I know you said sales energy is good and there's lower attrition.

Is that having an influence, for example? Thanks.",0.1821143,0.974

We've got terrific productivity. As I said earlier, reps are up a little bit, but it's really only at the margin and the productivity coming with the additional reps is where we wanted to be. So it's not just the volume thing or something along those lines in terms of just more reps to create more sales.",0.9349627,0.714

I think that on the pure payments basis, EMV is not driving these sales. I realize that's a popular topic of conversation, but that has more to do with other participants in the industry overall rather than us directly as a payment technology provider. So I think, we're very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for better stronger sale and more sales.",0.9465617,0.956
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,151,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,David E.

But I really I don't have a single thing at which to point, Tien-tsin, that's different from where things were, I think the engine is working well. The leadership is in place. And the machining tooling that underlies managing this 1,500 person complex sales force is working well.",0.6454018,0.649

We actually have seen the acceleration already in the last number of quarters that Ezidebit. We partnered with those guys a number of years ago, it's been just over three years now this month.

GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,154,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So what I would tell you is give a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand and certainly relative to one of the last questions are doing nothing, but capturing share in that marketplace environment.",0.3854093,0.17
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,155,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So if you were probably to go look at the rate of organic transactional growth for Visa and MasterCard and your peers in Australia and New Zealand, they would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has a very good model with very good team and they're doing all the right things.

The margin change obviously helps, but as I'll note, we're absorbing more FX in there as well. I think overall tax rate, I think the expectation remains pretty much the same as what we described back in July. We think it's going to approach 30, it was 28.5, so 28.5, 29, something in that ballpark sort of approaching kind of the high 20's to 30 range remains our expectation for tax rate.",0.4178082,0.89

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I would say the guide itself doesn't suggest an increase in or excuse me, a decrease in the effective tax rate that's not what's driving the increase in the guide. It's really the Q1 performance coupled with our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increase in expense synergies that we're targeting now for fiscal 2017 relative to the Heartland transaction, obviously, offset slightly by some incremental FX headwinds.",0.2596513,0.852

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Unfortunately, the pound is off 2% to 3% relative to where it was in the last two weeks, quite frankly. We're now seeing it down around 127, it was 134, most of September, it was 1, obviously a little higher on average for Q1. So I think we remain cautious probably as it relates to the pound specifically, particularly in light of the size of that business relative to the overall size of the Global Payment. The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy with the pound it appears as well.",0.0326899,-0.296
GPN-2017-Q1-2016-10-05,168,Answer,2016-10-05,1,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we've seen weakness albeit maybe not as severe as we've seen in the pound. We've seen general weakness across the Board in most of the major currencies in which we have exposure. So I do think it could end up being almost an additional full point for the full-year, particularly in light of my view, and I think our view that when you get to December, I think, we expect the Fed to raise. I think in a rising rate environment here in the U.S., it's going to continue to put pressure on foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which causes again the bake in a little more FX headwind into our forecast for the remainder of the year.",0.2960772,-0.731

We did mention today that active and gaming in some of our markets here in the United States have recovered pretty substantially. They still present some headwinds relative to the rate of growth that we just announced today.

So let me just start by saying by, kind of not answering the question, but I do want to call out our relationship-led businesses. So they also had a very good quarter.

GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,125,Question,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You've had a lot of success in Europe with bank JVs, like HSBC, la Caixa, Erste, how does the acquisition of Worldline PAYONE in Austria sync up with your Erste JV? Is that - are those two operating independently entirely? Or do you see some synergies potentially between the both?",0.0270859,0.939
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,126,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"No. David, its Cameron. I'll jump in on that. So this is actually a great opportunity to extend our joint venture with Erste. We're actually purchasing that business through the joint venture with our partners at Erste and Caixa - excuse me, Caixa as well. So this is an extension of our existing partnership with Erste. They were very excited about the opportunity to grow and expand our business in their home market of Austria.",0.4287049,0.932

GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,132,Question,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Thank you. Good morning. I really like the property management acquisition. I'm curious if it's - if we were to compare it to the EHR space, easier, harder to monetize than that? Just trying to get a sense of how the time line of potential payment penetration? And did you give the revenue run rate and growth before synergies? Thanks.",0.4884807,0.881
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,133,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So Tien-Tsin, it's Cameron. Good morning. So I would say, on balance, I would think it's probably easier to monetize the payment opportunity in the real estate space. There's obviously secular trends there that we think are very powerful around the digitization of the payment stream within real estate, whether its recurring monthly rental payments, HOA fees or other one-off fees that lessees need to pay.",0.0510585,0.976
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,134,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we think the opportunity to drive better penetration from a payment standpoint in that market is going to be easier than some of the other vertical markets we've been in. I think we view real estate really as the quintessential vertical market, where you have the intersection of software and drain - payments where that nexus is very strong and obviously creates a significant opportunity for us to drive meaningful growth and share gains and, obviously, margin expansion over a period of time.",0.5585305,0.906
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,135,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We expect the business, to your second question, to generate roughly $100 million of revenue in 2021. It's growing double-digits nicely. It sort of fits the rule of 40 for a software business very nicely today. And obviously, we think we can do a variety of things to accelerate that rate of revenue growth over time and scale the business more effectively by leveraging the broader Global Payments ecosystem.",0.511208,0.949
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,137,Question,2021-05-04,1,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"So, just from a benchmarking standpoint, what do you expect going forward here? It sounds like SMB spend is coming back, relationship is doing great, anything to add?",0.6590237,0.967
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,138,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yeah. So Tien-Tsin, this is Paul, and Cameron may want to add. We've been talking for several quarters now about this positive decoupling. And obviously, we saw in a more dramatic way, certainly on the positive side, this last quarter. And so yeah, we continue to kind of see that positive decoupling continue, and we would expect that continue.",0.0647189,0.9
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,139,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"The second reason, as we had outlined before when we said that we expected that positive decoupling to occur once things got to a much more kind of normalized basis. The only other thing I would highlight is, as you look at that overall revenue growth number, do recall that we have probably 300 basis points of headwind related to those three vertical market businesses that are still, while they've improved from the depths of the pandemic and we highlighted gaming as being now an absolute grower.",0.302145,0.888

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We're still seeing some meaningful headwind related to the active school business and the gaming business, that if you kind of looked at it ex those, you kind of add 300 basis points to the overall growth rate. And then, if you do that, you can see really some, on a volume-to-volume basis, some very positive decouple. And Cameron, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.",0.5410959,0.7
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,141,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. The only other thing I would say just on top of that is the international markets continue to be a bit of a drag as well. So if you really look at US payments and our growth in US payments, it was probably high single digits, maybe almost 10%, pure payments in the US market in the first quarter. So even more decoupling than I think the sort of highlights represent.",0.0678705,0.533
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,142,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And the other thing I would say is, over time, I expect that decoupling continue, partially because our international businesses are more exposed to domestic trends in those markets. So as those markets reopen, we're not as reliant upon the cross border volume to drive revenue growth in those businesses. As domestic markets reopen internationally, we'll obviously see a nice tailwind as a result of that.",0.0227273,0.902

I wanted to ask about - kind of a high level question about whether the pandemic will have any lasting effect on your sales process, particularly in merchant, given the increasing importance of e-commerce and omni and digital. Have you had to change your kind of go-to-market or sales approach? Or do you contemplate having to do so? And then if you could also just comment on bookings trends more generally as we head into Q2? That would be great.",0.2409714,0.949

It's Cameron, and then I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in with a little bit more color as well. So I would say, maybe to start, even well before the pandemic, we've been equipping our sales professionals around the globe with the best technology, the best capabilities to be able to sell.",0.2375467,0.802
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,148,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M.

GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,149,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I think partly a credit to our sales teams in particular, they found new and innovative ways to continue to sell in a difficult environment, in particular our relationship-led sales professionals here in the US market that really operate under a commission only model, they were very motivated and incentivized to go out and find greater ways to be able to sell into the marketplace.",0.3953923,0.757
GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,150,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So the use of technology and deploying more technology towards the sales process itself, as well as the ingenuity, I would say, of our sales professionals, I don't expect that to change post pandemic.

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I'll call out a few particular highlights on the first quarter bookings performance, and I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in. If I start with our US relationship-led business, we had a record sales quarter, as Jeff and Paul highlighted in the prepared remarks. It was about 5% higher than our old record and up about 27% year-over-year, which I think is a really important metric as well, given that, again, kind of the 12-weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were really not impacted by the pandemic.",0.4707347,0.952

We also had great new booking performance in our payroll business as well. We had record sales in that business, up again 42% year-over-year, so very strong performance in our US relationship-led payments and payroll business in the first quarter.",0.1562889,0.875

Within our vertical market business, we saw very strong, I'd say, booking trends across the business.

But maybe hadn't been thinking about the second and most recent rounds. And so now that those are contemplated, I'm trying to understand how much you think that actually is influencing the increase in guidance?

GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,209,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"So that's kind of - you want to try to kind of quantify the impact of additional stimulus net of the effect that stimulus has on other products, on yield, the overall tax, season picture, so that gives you kind of a quantification of kind of that difference between - kind of mid single digit growth for that business in that kind of more mid to high kind of single-digit growth.",0.3816568,0.361

GPN-2021-Q1-2021-05-04,211,Answer,2021-05-04,1,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"I would say as it relates to stimulus across our overall business, I think, time will tell. Clearly, you're getting some impact in volumes related to stimulus. We're just seeing it kind of, across the board. I think it gets a little bit harder to kind of pick part that into the overall volume picture and say, well, how much is stimulus, how much is unemployment benefits, what all that kind of looks like.",0.2588757,-0.176

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"No, I think if you look at the merchant business more broadly, it's not driven that much by stimulus. If you think about it and we've talked about this before, we're more exposed to credit than we are debit in our merchant business, and stimulus isn't really driving incremental credit spend.",0.3458904,0.671

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"What we're really seeing in the merchant business, I think, obviously, is the impact of the recovery as well as the fact that savings rates are at generational highs and there's a lot of pent-up demand.

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So certainly, on the margin, putting more dollars in consumer's pockets, it's going to be helpful to the merchant business. But I don't view, sort of, the expansion we saw in Q4 to Q1 to really be driven predominantly by stimulus. I think it's more just a macro recovery in general and the fact that, obviously, consumers are very well positioned to be able to spend in the current environment as the recovery progresses.",1.0401619,0.863

I wanted to ask first on the issuing side. So, you did announce a bunch of renewals and also it looks like AWS pipeline is picking up here.

So, we're really pleased with the performance this year in the issuing business in particular, and we continue to make very good progress in AWS on two fronts: first, on the technology side; and second, on the distribution side. As it relates to the existing customers, there really has not been any change in the competitive landscape. I would say, we continue to believe that we win kind of 80% of the jump balls that come up. I think we announced today that we've got 10 folks in the hopper on the issuing side, six of which are competitive takeaways as before the LOIs that we've recently signed.

So, in the last quarter, we've met with a number of our large financial institution customers. And I think the public cloud first centric approach that we've taken with AWS starting a year and a quarter ago, really sells and resonates. I would say, as we said, the time, Tien-Tsin dramatically expands our target addressable market, I think we said it was 3x last August. But certainly, with large FIs and across the spectrum really does resonate. We think we're ahead there based on feedback from our customer base.",0.1850534,0.871

The vast majority of those prospects are in neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So, we certainly have a number of prospects on the traditional FI side, particularly in light of the Amazon relationship. I would say, the vast majority of what we're looking at there on the co-sale side with AWS and now also with 10x and PwC really center around neobanks, fintechs and start-ups, and that 25 number represents the vast majority of them.

The only thing I would say, Tien-Tsin, is I just reiterate how happy we were with the growth in the third quarter. We had strong kind of transactional growth, strong account on file growth. So, our volume-based revenue was growing right in that kind of long-term growth rate of that mid single digits. And so, we expect that kind of fundamental growth to continue.

Tien-Tsin, we talked about this at the Investor Day that that target of the long-term cycle kind of guidance was consistent with how we're targeting for next year to be at that higher end of that 17% to 20% range. Obviously, we've got work to do as it relates to finalizing kind of all of our plans. We'll come back and give the formal guide at the start of next year.

GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,71,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. I think if you look at the vertical market overall, we saw a strong sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3, about 500 basis points relative to 2019 results for that business. But, it is fair to say that we're still on the road to recovery in the vertical market business overall, largely because of the vertical markets that you highlighted. ACTIVE and K-2 continue to be down relative to 2019 levels. We did see sequential improvement in both, and they're trending in the right direction. But there's still some time to go, I think, before those markets get back to certainly, the levels of performance that we saw pre-pandemic. If you look at the business overall, it was still down slightly relative to 2019 in the third quarter. But, we are expecting it to turn positive versus 2019 in the fourth quarter, giving us good momentum kind of heading into 2022 as we continue again down the path of recovery with the vertical market business overall.",0.1286982,0.927

GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,75,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Thanks, Ramsey. So, on capital allocation, I think you should look at what we've done in the last 12 months as being a really good indicator of kind of where we're focused. So, in the last 12 months, as we said in our prepared remarks, we've invested $2.5 billion in M&A, primarily I think 60% of which is around cloud SaaS-based technologies. But, we did that while returning nearly $2 billion in capital to our shareholders also during the last 12 months. So, I'd say, from a capital allocation point of view, and Paul, I think, described the math on the repurchases. I don't really think that's -- I don't really think that's changed. So, I think balance between the two is essentially what we've been doing and I would expect that to continue.",0.0622776,0.906

So, we look at things that are in the software space. We obviously now look at things that are in the B2B space post the MineralTree announcement. As we said, time last month, we're actually in September, MineralTree, it was probably one of our first dilutive deals, and we're absorbing that, both in our annual numbers as well as in our cycle guide. That certainly has expanded 10 as to what we're looking at, looking at new geographies, e-com and the like. So, I don't think that's changed, Ramsey. I think we've got the full suite of opportunities.

Could you talk about the PayPal relationship, how it sort of evolved over time? And also maybe elaborate a little bit on the crypto piece. And if I can just bolt on another one there.

GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,79,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say, there's a few differences before I get to the crypto comment. The first thing I'd say is, we're adding additional geographies as part of the relationship. The second, we're adding additional vertical markets, where we can go together jointly to market with PayPal, which also is an expansion.

The first piece is if you're using a PayPal digital wallet and you're buying crypto in the wallet at Bank card sources, particularly anywhere in the world, but especially for these illustrative purposes, North America and Europe, that will be us helping to facilitate those purchases on behalf of PayPal. And the second part of the crypto stuff is PayPal needs an acceptance at things like coin base to the extent that you're going online, buying crypto at something like a coin base and use PayPal as a pay button to procure that purchase to the extent that it's bank card related that also is something that we expect to have a hand in. So, those are new things for us. Those things are hard to do on the acceptance side, especially on a worldwide basis. So, we're pleased to be in a position to do that.",0.5743772,0.696

I think your question was, what were the growth rates versus 2019 for the merchant business globally as well as for the U.S. merchant business. So again, merchant globally, excluding our vertical market channel was up 19% versus 2019 levels in the quarter and the U.S. number was, I think, '22, '23, something in that range for the third quarter, pretty consistent with what we saw in the second quarter.",0.2232254,0.0

I'll jump in and I'll ask Jeff and Paul to add any color that they would like to. Maybe I'll just start with sort of baseline and things. As I mentioned earlier, the overall vertical market business, it was up roughly 16%, 17% versus Q3 of 2020. It's still down slightly versus 2019 levels, call it, mid single digits.

AdvancedMD, TouchNet, and again, our QSR business all reported very strong growth as they consistently have throughout the pandemic in the third quarter. TouchNet, AdvancedMD, both up mid-teens in the quarter. Our QSR business was up probably mid-30s versus 2020 levels. Again, we've seen a nice rebound in that business. And then, relative to 2019, TouchNet's up 20-plus-percent; AdvancedMD is up almost 30%; and our QSR business is up almost 10%, call it, 8% to 10%, somewhere in that ballpark versus 2019 levels.

School and ACTIVE continue to be below 2019 levels. We are seeing improvement sequentially, but the road to recovery for those businesses is obviously going to be a little more long tailed than what we're seeing in other vertical markets. Gaming in this quarter was flat versus 2019. So, it has come back quite well. It was up meaningfully over 2020 levels, almost 30% in the quarter, and it got to flat versus 2019. And again, we expect that to turn positive in the fourth quarter.",1.2135741,0.44

GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,89,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, I'll pause there and maybe just turn my attention to bookings trends because that continues to be a very good story for the vertical market businesses. We saw excellent new booking trends in the quarter, our recurring revenues in that business. Bookings were up 35% year-over-year. AdvancedMD recorded a booking record, up nearly 50% year-over-year. Our Xenial SaaS solutions were up almost 50% year-over-year and TouchNet was up almost 35% year-over-year. And ACTIVE and schools continue to see good booking trends despite obviously the overall macro continuing to weigh on those businesses. ACTIVE bookings were up in the mid-teens year-over-year. And our school business had positive booking trends in the quarter as well. So, as we think about the business overall, the bookings trends we've seen in this quarter, and frankly, what we've seen throughout the course of 2021 give us a lot of confidence that from a momentum perspective, we're obviously building a nice backlog of business. And as the macro in the more heavily impacted verticals improves, we obviously have a lot of tailwinds for the vertical market channel heading into 2022 and 2023.",0.7076588,0.838

I know it reflected some deceleration off an easier comp, but we did see stimulus start to run off. And I know, Paul, you made a brief comment about that. So, I wanted to hear a little bit more about how you're thinking about sort of the normalized effects of the stimulus expiring. And you talked about the full year growth target being intact there, kind of mid to high single digits. But, with one quarter left in the year, wondering if we can hone in a little bit more on where you think Q4 may land, based on everything you know today.",1.1682692,0.901

What really impacted us in 3Q was that unemployment insurance kind of additional piece that we were picking up. If you took that out, we grew this business in the third quarter at kind of that longer term mid to high single-digit target for the third quarter. And as we look to next quarter, as we've said, we're expecting this to be in that kind of mid to high single digits for the year. We're expecting that business to roughly generate at roughly that level in the fourth quarter to that kind of longer term target. So yes, we get past, obviously ran comparison benefits for some period of time related to the stimulus and unemployment, but as it relates to the third quarter, that was the biggest dynamic that was playing through that resulted in that roughly 2% growth rate.",2.7884615,0.0
GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,93,Question,2021-11-02,3,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"I was actually just wondering if you could talk about the recovery in the vertical markets and how that -- I thank you for all the color already, but how that plays into your 2022 EPS guidance, what kind of levels of recovery in revenue versus either '19 or '20?

GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,94,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So, I guess, I would start off by kind of adding on what Cameron said is that starting in the fourth quarter, this turns into a growth tailwind for us. And we've talked for several quarters now of this vertical market there because of the components of the business being somewhere about 300 to 400 basis-point headwind to our segment margin over the last several quarters. And starting in the fourth quarter with the kind of sequential quarter growth we're seeing, this turns into a tailwind. And I think, as Cameron said, with all the bookings success that kind of we've had, we're expecting that essentially 300 to 400 basis-point headwind to kind of turn into kind of a commensurate kind of tailwind as we move into 2022. Obviously, we're in that planning process right now and we'll kind of get more kind of discrete levels of insight as we talk about the 2022 guide. But, the key point is exactly what kind of Cameron said is kind of a headwind turning into a tailwind, as we move to next year.",0.9504438,0.785
GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,95,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And just in general, as we look to the 2022 guide and you kind of once again kind of go back to what we said at our Investor Day around our cycle guidance as it relates to revenue growth, those are the levels that we're targeting at or even slightly better at the levels that we're targeting at for next year as a revenue growth matter.",2.193787,0.959

And then, if you think about the distribution of your margin expansion as we look ahead and kind of what is implied for the Merchant Solutions segment in the fourth quarter, how should we think about the distribution of margin expansion across your segments, given all the opportunities you see in the growth path that you're focused on? Thank you very much, guys.",1.2352071,0.7
GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,97,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So, as you talk about this year specifically and that kind of margin distribution, I mean it's very consistent kind of a year with what we saw in the third quarter, which is merchant is the biggest margin kind of driver for us as a company this year, coming off the big margin gains that we saw in our issuing business and our Business and Consumer Solutions last year. And so, as we move into next year, things become more balanced in that regard. It's kind of margin kind of deliverance across the segments gets into a kind of more normalized kind of range. And obviously, at our Investor Day, we kind of talked about on ex-synergy, kind of what we expect kind of cycle guidance margin expansion to be. But obviously, for this year and for the remaining of the fourth quarter, the merchant margin expansion is the biggest driver.",2.5155325,0.0

We had decent MasterCard global volumes, I think Visa at 121 and MasterCard at 128. So, you're really close to that. I know it's a hot button issue for why it's a little bit below. I don't think it's losing share. I think it's just some of the verticals and the SMB exposure. But maybe, A, you can kind of confirm that.

So again, if you look back at our investor conference from September, Dave, on the left-hand side of that page, you will see how we do the calculation, and we're pretty clear about how we do it.

Would you be able to just parse out the FX impact in this quarter from both, merchant and issuer? And then, in 4Q, just trying to back into what's implied in merchant to get to the 20% for the full year. It doesn't look like there's any real embedded improvement versus 2019 levels, at least from Q3. So, just trying to better understand the puts and takes there. It sounds like vertical markets a little bit better sequentially, FX a bit tougher, and then maybe just kind of holding October trends kind of flat through the rest of the year. So, just any kind of help there on the puts and takes relative to 3Q, what you have embedded for merchant? Thanks.",2.5747041,-0.875
GPN-2021-Q3-2021-11-02,108,Answer,2021-11-02,3,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. So, roughly about 100 basis points is the way to think about the currency impact to us at a kind of total company level, and that's in the kind of the rough zone as it relates to merchant as well. And I wouldn't call out anything much more dramatic on that on the issuer side. And if you look at 4Q, which is kind of our FX commentary before relative to our expectations, if you look at 4Q, we're expecting about half that kind of benefit in 4Q relative to 3Q. So, kind of incremental kind of headwind in the fourth quarter relative to our expectations of what we were expecting to see and saw in the third quarter versus what we're kind of expecting to see in the fourth quarter, given where rates are, which is primarily driven by kind of euro and the pound and what's happened there.

So, we're -- as we said, for the fourth quarter, we're expecting kind of roughly to be at kind of an overall compared to '20 where we expect to land for the year for merchant.

As Jeff commented earlier, we're very pleased to have announced the CITI renewal, which was obviously a very important renewal for us on the commercial side. So yes, both, as a third quarter matter, the growth that we saw there, obviously, we're still looking to kind of get back to where the pre-COVID levels would be in that business, and we're trending in that direction.

And if you could remind us quickly, the timing of some of the new wins that you're expecting coming into the numbers next year?

Maybe I'll take the kind of the MineralTree and really all of the acquisitions. And we kind of commented on those as it relates to the overall margin impact in the prepared remarks is we've got, call it, a roughly 50 basis-point kind of headwind to the margin in the fourth quarter related to all of the acquisitions. Obviously, MineralTree is the most impactful there because, as Jeff said, it was dilutive.

I would say that in general, that has become lesser of a seasonal outlier in the fourth quarter, just the way that business is and where we have certain pricing bundled and now that's lesser of an impact there. And then obviously, in our business and consumer, there's obviously kind of different kind of moving parts now with all the stimulus kind of comparisons, specifically tax season and the first quarter and depending on how that kind of plays out into the second quarter has been kind of the seasonal call out as it relates to that business.

I'll just remind you, I spent a lot of time on this on the investor conference speaking about this very topic. If you think about our strategy, it's really centered around commerce enablement. And whether we're working with a software partner or we're working, obviously, with our own technology stack from a software standpoint where we go to market and verticals with our own capabilities, the objective is to continue to bring more merchants into our ecosystem, leveraging technology. And once you're in our ecosystem, obviously, finding new ways to provide solutions to them to help them run their businesses more effectively and obviously help them drive more top of funnel opportunities for their business.

It makes the ISVs offering more attractive. It gives us more opportunity to grow and scale with the ISV.

So that's part of the value-added services that you asked about. And then Cameron tied it to you. And I think all that stuff is working. And I think if you look at our results in the third quarter, mid-cam was up 13% in the third quarter, volumes were up 20% versus 2019. So, it's the commerce enablement that Cameron is describing in response to your question, which is to say the virtuous circle of software at the top of the funnel, the cross-sells, the data analytics, the new partnerships, all that stuff is resulting in clearly above-market growth on the stats I just gave and what we put in the press release.",0.1480427,0.44

In Europe, we generated strong local currency net revenue growth in the quarter led by double-digit organic growth in our United Kingdom and Spanish businesses.

As a result, we now expect total annual run-rate expense synergies from the transaction to be approximately $135 million, an increase of $10 million compared to our prior target. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was double-digits for the quarter surpassing our expectations and accelerating sequentially from the first quarter. This was primarily driven by our combined Heartland sales channel, which generated double-digit organic growth in our integrated solutions business, which produced another quarter of mid-teens growth.",1.1341843,0.961

On a normalized basis, this combined distribution channel produced low double-digit net revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Although we do not have exact figures for the legacy Global Payments and legacy Heartland businesses as the channels are now combined, we estimate each grew low double-digits organically compared to their respective performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Canada again, delivered solid performance with low single-digit growth in local currency consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in 2016. Our European business performed exceptionally well this quarter delivering 18% net revenue growth on a local currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 6% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound, which declined nearly 20% year-over-year. Local currency net revenue growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. European operating margin of 46.7% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration cost associated with the Erste transaction and the impacts of foreign currency.

So we have been partners with Heartland at this point for 6 months since from the close - since the date of November. I would tell you probably 5 to 6 months I believe were record new sales at Heartland. I think we have been successful in doing what we do in our partnership, because as we have done with the Ezidebit, APT and PayPros really enabling the people who are best suited to continue the acceleration of their business to go ahead and do that without interference from us here in Atlanta. And I think that's really not different at Heartland than it was at Ezidebit, APT and PayPros. And of course, those new sales are now translating into revenue in calendar 2017. I think we are focused on what we think we can do best here at corporate, which is enabling cross sales into additional regions around the world, which we described I think now in the last three calls as well as providing a consistent, stable technology and operating environment for the whole company, but in particular, for Heartland.

GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,37,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Jeff, I'd be happy to. I mean, I can amplify that a little bit Glenn, again when you look around, I would start by saying that the sales leadership that was in place when we executed the merger is still in place. We have moved some things around. We have actually restructured a little bit, but that's all as a platform for the next phase of growth. So, the same leaders in place as you would expect, by the way, that's our track record around the world as you know whether you are in the UK or Asia, you run into a local leader who knows the markets and then we enable cross sales, we enable synergies, we enable consistency of service levels, that's what we do best, so really happy with the team. They are making great progress as you have already heard from some of the sales and Jeff's prepared comments, really good progress around the world. That all resulted in 10% transaction growth for Heartland between the holiday period and far more than that with e-commerce. E-commerce was much, much higher than that, but all in that was a really nice number for the peak holiday period. In addition, just in the period we have owned Heartland, that sales team has delivered low-teen sales growth, record months, month after month, as Jeff noted, so really happy with the trajectory. But don't miss the fact that beyond that, we are selling leads that they generate abroad. We have closed a lead in the UK. We closed Heartland's first deal in Puerto Rico. And also don't miss the fact that it's beyond just that sales force, right. It's also the TouchNet Campus Solutions where we sold a deal in Canada just this past quarter. To an existing software customer we sold them Global Payments payment solutions. And then obviously at Heartland, commerce continues to make great progress in Canada as well where we are selling our gift platform to Canadian customers of Global Payments as well as Canadian customers of our dealers. So, all-in really good momentum starts with the fact that it's an integration strategy matter. We wanted to keep the team in place and better equip them to sell more and all that's working just as planned right now.",0.3156587,0.998
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,38,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Hey, Glenn. It's Cameron. I will wrap up maybe just spend a moment on the expense side of the equation. As David highlighted and I think I have said before, our priority from an integration point of view has always been not to disrupt the sales momentum in the business and I think we have done a particularly good job of that as we work through the last 7 or 8 months since closing the transaction in April. On the expense side, we have identified incremental opportunities relative to what we assumed going into the transaction, particularly in the area of corporate support functions. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we also have identified some tax planning initiatives between the two companies that we think will yield some tax benefits that flow through the effective tax rate. We have also identified incremental savings in our operating environment. So, we have been able to leverage as we look to combine operating centers here in the U.S. and continue to leverage our offshore in the Philippines. So from our point of view, again, we have raised our overall synergy run-rate targets to $135 million from the prior $125 million. A lot of the technology integration work is still in front of us. I think we remain optimistic about our ability to realize obviously the synergies that we have targeted in that area, but much of that work is still yet to come, but sitting here today, I think we are pretty enthusiastic about where we sit.",0.1606476,0.958
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,40,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Glenn, it's hard to disaggregate the synergy expansion to each individual driver. I will talk about it more from a macro point of view and then share a little bit of color around just how the underlying business had performed, but I think also obviously contributes to the results we have seen. So as we look at the core business, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our estimate for Heartland growth in the quarter on an organic basis in the direct sales channel was roughly low double-digits, so think about as kind of 11%, 12%. Legacy GPN, we also view as being in the low double-digits in the quarter as well, probably 10%, 11% this quarter, both accelerating sequentially from the first quarter. When those businesses - those direct sales businesses, which are higher margin businesses are growing at that pace, that's obviously going to contribute to margin expansion in a fairly meaningful way. In addition to that, our technology led businesses in the U.S., our integrated business as well as our software-driven businesses at Heartland, Heartland commerce, campus solutions, school solutions each of those grew either high single, low double in the quarter as well. Those are higher margin businesses. They are also contributing to the margin expansion we saw in the quarter. And then lastly, synergies are naturally an important driver of margin expansion in the business. They help us to absorb the margin degradation that we obviously have assumed with Heartland coming in at a lower margin. But the growth we have seen in the business has helped offset some of that to a large degree coupled with our ability to realize expenses in the quarter has driven that certainly what we view to be fairly attractive margin expansion for the North American business.",0.0392279,0.977

When we think about that organic growth in North America, I think it was high single-digits, the direct business in the first quarter and then obviously it accelerated to the low double-digits. I guess, what can you point to that cause that acceleration? And when you look at the guidance it looks like you guys are believing it will go back down or decelerate back to the high single-digits, which is still a good growth rate, but just want to understand the dynamics there?",0.8024823,0.847
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,46,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Hey, Bryan, it's Jeff. I will start off and I will ask Cameron to join me. So I would say really it's a continuation of the trend of strengthening of that business. As Cameron mentioned to Glenn, our higher growth, higher margin businesses both at legacy global and also at Heartland are accelerating. So when those businesses are already growing north of the market continue the rates of growth at better margin opportunities, you are naturally going to see higher rates of growth in North America really led by as we said in our prepared remarks, lead by OpenEdge, which 4.5 years after we closed that transaction in APT produced another mid-teens quarter. In many of the Heartland businesses, Heartland Payments, but also as Cameron said school, campus, Heartland commerce etcetera. So, I think it's really the businesses continue to hit their stride. As David mentioned, we have record sales months at Heartland. While that doesn't translate in general to immediate revenue acceleration, it does over the cycle of course. And now that it's been 6 months since we closed the Heartland transaction, our expectation is that they continue to see the benefits of that partnership in our rates of revenue growth. There is really no deceleration expectation into calendar 2017. As you know, our models that we have been articulating certainly since our Investor Day in October '15 and updated in December '15 post the announcement of our partnership with Heartland is high single-digits organic growth. So, I would read into, gee, you produced the 11 and 12 and now you are saying high single-digits any other Bryan than a reiteration of what our model is over the cycle. Obviously, we are giving guidance here on January 9 for all of calendar '17. As you know, with our history, it's important for us to make sure we are in the trajectory heading into the calendar year.",0.2209964,0.978

So, Mercury did impact obviously the quarter as it relates to reported net revenue. Our ISO or wholesale business was down low double-digits again this quarter similar to Q1 as we have not yet annualized the anniversary of Mercury migrating off. That will happen really at the end of the first quarter of calendar 2017. So at that point, I would expect it to no longer be a headwind to growth. Obviously, we have clearly grown through that from an earnings point of view. It's really a revenue optic issue that we have been managing through here over the last 9 months or so since they really migrated off of us, so that we anniversary at the end of the first quarter of Q1. At that point, we would expect the wholesale business in calendar '17 beyond that point to essentially be flat to maybe down slightly as we have been guiding for the last couple of years.",0.0772105,0.735

Wanted to start off on the U.S. business as well and just looking at the 50 basis points of enhancement from Heartland, is that all cross-sell or is there some pricing that's built into that?

In back half of your question, I would say it's not macro. We think it's actually very good execution and very well positioned businesses. When we are tech-led as we are software-enabled we think we are in the right spot. You will find other competitors talking about just beginning to think about entering the integrated space right now. Obviously we are 5 years into that process and really still continuing to grow great there.

Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"In terms of your direct question about revenue synergies for the year driving the kinds of numbers that Cameron quoted in his prepared comments, there are really a couple of categories. There is some new products of rolling out based on the combined technologies. There is also sort of some new sales strategies and then finally their economic enhancements. I will talk about each for just a moment. Couple of new projects are our insights products, which is high level analytics where we can combine our payments information with customer information for a restaurant and our commerce business as well as our payments business to give small to medium-sized customers exactly what we talked about in our Analyst Day 1.5 years ago which is the same abilities that their much larger competitors have to take data - to take new versus repeat customers and total visits and sales volumes and day park sales and things like that and analyze that and drive that into marketing campaigns and loyalty campaigns. There is a new lending with series of products we are bringing out as well that we are re-enabling for the sales force of Heartland now making it much easier for the reps to sell without marketing campaigns and some new technologies. So that's all new revenue growth that wasn't in the combined basis before.",1.1893123,0.948
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,57,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"When I talk about new sales strategies, I will give you one example of that, which is really an inside sales strategy we have just initiated over the past few months with the sales force based out of Heartland and that's the ability to go chase white spaces that Heartland never chased in the past. So, Heartland has traditionally and rightfully been focused on towns and cities and metropolitan areas as we spread our 1,500 reps around the country. There is a lot of business in between those spaces that we can chase with inside sales and either turn that over to a face to face rep, close it ourselves turn into a lead, etcetera, etcetera, so nice numbers, they can come out of that over time, selling in between Cincinnati and Columbus, for example, instead of just adding Columbus metro areas. It's a really nice stuff there. And then finally, it's really I would call it the area of sort of economic enhancements and really what we are doing there we will not price for price's sake. We are matching economics the way we create real value for customers. We believe the combination of Global Payments and Heartland provides world-class service on an industry leading infrastructure. We ought to be able to be compensated for that. It's pretty simple. So we have kicked off certain initiatives with the sales team to ensure we are compensated where we are providing high-value and incremental value beyond what the market provides to our customers. Possible examples of that includes maybe the types of reporting we provide, recognizing the value of this extensive compliance infrastructure that we at, Global Payments, have built over these past few years and then the high touch customer service we operate in and out of our Jeffersonville facility. Really what we are just ensuring is that we match our economics to the value creation and the investments we have made. So, all those things would add up into the revenue synergy commentary that Cameron provided.",0.485087,0.985

GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,59,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, George. It's Jeff. What I would say is it's really an extension of our technology enabled distribution discussion that we have been having since really our October '15 Analyst Day. I think that our perspective is, as we said in the Analyst Day, that's our third of the company's revenues generating the vast majority of its growth. I think we have been very successful as we discussed on today's release over a period of multiple years. With that strategy, we have made progress as Cameron described, with our partners at Heartland in bringing some of their nonpayment specific, but technology enabled related businesses to grow far faster than the market. And that's something we think is a key theme heading over the next period of time in our cycle. So, I would say yes to your question, but I really view it as a subset that technology-enabled discussion that we have been having since October 2015. If we can find businesses that are in our sweet spot, George, they are growing at 2x to 3x the rate of the market rate of growth at very attractive margins north of where we are trading, north of where we are operating and we have been going to accelerate those with what we do not just in the United States but globally, those are pretty good positions for us to be in.",0.2078292,0.989

George, if we can find technology businesses that look like OpenEdge or campus or commerce, so cloud-based SaaS solutions where we can innovate in a defined vertical market, provide software-enabled solutions as well as commerce solutions and payment solutions. That's very attractive as in a place where software and payment solutions compliment each other. So, I would maybe say it's not as simple as we are looking for point-of-sale software companies. We are looking for places where software naturally drives payments and payments naturally drives software where they compliment each other and we can drive enhanced growth the way Jeff described it.",0.7427506,0.977
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,70,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Ashwin, it's David. I think what we see with both these businesses is properly positioned and properly executed. You have got really nice growers. As Cameron pointed out another quarter of mid-teens growth from OpenEdge, really nice double-digit and mid-teens growth from our key TouchNet software and other campus solutions assets, so we like the characteristics. I think what you will see us do is continue to look at the right way to serve verticals and go deeper by marrying technology to payments. So, in many cases, that's partnering like in OpenEdge with this amazing degree of integration we provide to multiple verticals than the campaign management managing the partner base. In other verticals we are going to look closely and say wow, the integration is so tight between the software and the payments and this is a vertical that's not competitive anywhere else in our space. So, why don't we think about pursuing the entire vertical ourselves and own the entire technology stack, that's what campus does, that's what we do in commerce. Each of which has zero over level OpenEdge. So you can see we have the opportunity to blank at the United States vertical by vertical, customizable flexible solutions and then uniquely unlike anyone else in the space globalize the same solutions, take them abroad with our technology infrastructure and our unique sales reach.",0.5965203,0.989
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,77,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Oscar, it's Cameron, I will jump in. I would say sitting here today, I would leverage off the comments we made when we announced the Heartland transaction back in December of 2015. At that time, we talked about 1% to 2% revenue enhancement opportunity coming from the merger over time. Obviously, the revenue side takes a little longer to scale as opposed to the expense side where you can start taking out cost fairly quickly and we have been able to I think do that very effectively since closing on the transaction in April. On the revenue enhancement side, sitting here today, we have targeted 50 basis points of expansion in our calendar 2017 guide. I view that as the foundation. Obviously, as we work towards the 1% to 2% we talked about back in December of 2015, which would represent about $30 million to $60 million of incremental revenue coming from these enhancement opportunities that David described earlier. I will just reiterate something he said and I think is very important, this is not pricing for pricing sake, this is obviously cross-selling between our various distribution channels both domestically, internationally, it's new product, it's a digital enhancement to our customers and it's ensuring again that we are paid and compensated appropriately for the level of value service and capability that delivering to our customers through our combined business.",0.9754047,0.942
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,79,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Oscar, it's David. I am going to broadly answer the integrated question and suggest to you that we have substantial opportunities as we have enabled more and more platforms to sell fully integrated solutions across Europe and Asia. That includes something in Jeff's prepared comments, which is taking our micro-payments, unattended payment technology services around the world we are distributing that in Asia right now through a systems integrator. In addition, Heartland commerce, our restaurant hospitality SaaS-based integrated software solution can be sold all across Asia and all across Europe. We are enabling payment platforms to work with those folks as well and TouchNet, the software solution that powers campus solution is enabled for Puerto Rico, Canada and shortly UK and Asia. We are actually investing in a sales force in Europe and in Asia to resell that combined campus solutions commerce solution of Global Payments' payments with Heartland software in the campus area and in fact, the next month or so, we should enable them selling that actively, so really good progress there. I think your question maybe about the integrated solutions globalization projects we kicked off about 1 year, 1.5 years ago we talked about the Analyst Day that continues to make great progress. So we have over 60 partners signed in Canada. We also have a number of partners signed in the UK. We are exploring broader integration, broadening that to Asia. In addition, we have taken U.S. based partners in the UK and Canada. We actually have delivered over 1,000 merchants in Canada and the UK by an OpenEdge globalization, which may not sound like an enormous amount in the greater context of Global Payments, but each of these singles adds up to enhanced growth around the world and that's just the beginning of taking integrated payments around the world. As you can tell from my comments earlier about the vertical software married to the OpenEdge globalization strategy.",0.5389395,0.971
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,82,Question,2017-01-09,2,2017,Tien-Tsin Huang,JPMorgan Chase,"Hey, good morning. Good acceleration here. Just on the two questions. Asia-Pac is running above trend now, a couple of quarters, well above trend. So you are guiding above I think your cycle guidance, which was high single-digits, so are you more confident in your distribution or is the market growth just maybe better than you thought?",0.1083802,0.942
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,83,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Hey, Tien-tsin, it's Jeff, I'll start. No, I think we are more confident in our execution, distribution strategy. So I certainly think that there is likely going to be some benefit heading forward as we annualized some of the macro issues that we had in Greater China. But even before we did, I think you alluded this in your question, this is probably the third quarter in a row where we are seeing very good performance not just of course at Ezidebit where we are a good partner for about 2.5 years now, but in what we called business as usual Asia, which is Asia ex-Australia and New Zealand. This quarter, in particular, we singled out Greater China, India and the Philippines, of course, outside of Australia and New Zealand. So, I would say it's better distribution strategies, better execution in technologies, better product environments, for example, I think we are the only payment services technology company that's enabled Apple Pay. In all the markets, Apple Pay is around the world. We obviously, as you know, have a common technological and operational infrastructure for almost all of our markets, including in particular in this conversation for Asia, especially the new Asia. Our partnership, which is now 1.5 year old with - back in the Philippine Islands is performing quite nicely and one of the fastest GDP growth economies in Asia, the Philippines where you now have 28% or second largest market share in that country. So I think Tien-tsin, it's the aggregation of all those factors. If you like to think that the market itself will continue to accelerate and make it easier for us and I think we are hopeful that's the case, particularly across Greater China, but what I would say though is I think it really is a team out there who has done a fantastic job probably in the last three quarters in a row of helping to take our business where it really hasn't been the last 7 years.",0.3683274,0.995
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,84,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And Tien-tsin, it's Cameron, I will just add. On top of that, we have certainly improved scale in that business over the course of time. I think revenue in Asia since the end of fiscal '14 is up probably 75%. So if you are thinking about the business we are operating today, we have diversified distribution outside of kind of the Greater China market, those businesses tend to be growing at faster rates than even our Greater China businesses. We have created a much more scalable platform in that market. And I would certainly think what you have seen in Q1 and Q2 is the headwinds we saw in the Greater China markets back in fiscal '16 obviously have dissipated. We are seeing a more normalized macroeconomic environment that coupled with I think fantastic execution from our team there has really created a more optimistic outlook for what we can deliver in calendar 2017.",0.3019925,0.976

So just my second question on the Heartland acceleration there, can you specify, is that coming more from the core merchant business or in the non-card variety both in revenue and new sales? Thanks.",0.7485934,0.896
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,86,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Tien-tsin, it's David. I will give you some business probably like Cameron answer any direct math question, but I am not authorized to do that. So I point you back to a couple of things. One is we continue to post record sales month, so that's the core based merchant sales force which you are familiar, but I would point out, that merchant sales base is increasingly selling technology-enabled solutions. They are directly involved in each Heartland commerce sales and also involved in selling these add-on and cross-sell products. We are talking about each of which adds more value and more technology to our customers, but we are seeing consistent low-teen sales performance. As I said earlier, we had really nice double-digit transaction growth in the holiday period, much faster e-comm growth, so that core base is performing very, very well. And then the more integrated channels, the software-led technology-enabled channels, campus solutions and schools are both performing at double-digit or high single-digit levels led by TouchNet software, which is in its own mid-teens. And then of course, that obviously is bundled in or at least in terms conceptually bundled in for us with the rest of our tech solutions, the tech-enabled double-digit growers, mid-teens growers like OpenEdge. So really nice business performance across what you might think of as both sides of the Heartland channel, the traditional 1,500 sales folks as well as the tech-enabled software-led solutions in commerce school and campus.",0.1561723,0.991
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,87,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And Tien-tsin, it's Cameron. I will just add a little bit of color around the math side of it as we talked about before clearly the Heartland sort of payment side of the business. As we talked about, our estimate was it grew low double-digits this quarter, call it 11%, 12%, somewhere in that range which was acceleration relative to Q1. I would say, the collective software businesses that David described also accelerated slightly in Q1 to Q2. In aggregate, those businesses probably grew low double-digits as well led by again, campus and commerce and school also had a good quarter growing in the high single-digits. So I'd say each of those businesses performed very well in the quarter and accelerated to some degree relative to their Q1 performance, which contributed to the overall Q2 results.",0.8767123,0.743
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,91,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Steven, I can tell you the high level December looks fine. It looks kind of down in the middle of fairway for us overall, particularly if you are asking about kind of the Heartland base that has that retail quick service restaurant and restaurant exposure. We think we have a solid sales month and solid transaction month.",0.3270463,0.691
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,93,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Hey, Steven, it's Cameron. I will jump in there. On the FX side of the equation, we have talked about this a lot in the past and we were naturally hedged in, to some degree, in every market we operate in and around the world and that we have local denominated expenses associated primarily with our sales and distribution capabilities in markets. We don't do any sort of natural other hedging, excuse me, of FX exposures around the globe largely because we do the business as being a multinational business - part of being a multinational business is having foreign currency exposures. I think we took obviously a big amount of FX risk out of the business by virtue of executing the Heartland transaction which pivoted us from about 50-50 U.S. dollar to foreign currency exposure to roughly two-thirds U.S. dollar, which we think was a good thing for us to do in light of the strong dollar environment we have seen here over the last few years. But I wouldn't expect us to do ""derivative hedging"" of FX exposure around the globe. Again, we think that's just part of managing a multinational business. And we think the right way to operate the company more importantly is the way we are operating where a lot of the expense structure is U.S. dollar, because we are leveraging common technology and operating environments that are typically U.S. dollar driven, that's the most efficient way to operate and scale business like this. And I think that's the way we will continue to operate obviously going forward.",0.0516812,0.96
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,94,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"On the interest rate side, as we talked about before, we did enter into an incremental interest rate hedge $250 million notional amount in December that brings our total hedge position today to about $1 billion represents about 22% of our variable rate exposure. We do anticipate entering into additional interest rate hedges in calendar 2017 such that between debt reduction and incremental hedges, I would expect as we are exiting calendar 2017 to be towards our targeted hedge ratio of about 40% to 50%. We think that's the right place for us to be as a business. As you can imagine, our outlook for calendar 2017 assumes underlying rates are going to rise, so that is already baked into our expectations for calendar '17 as well as us entering into incremental hedges as we work through that targeted hedge position.",0.0457659,0.823
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,99,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Dan, it's Jeff, I will start. I will ask David to comment as well. What I would say is we probably have a 3 or 4-year history now of growing more quickly than the market and we also probably have a 3 or 4-year history on some of what we call our wholesale businesses like our ISO and direct businesses being relatively flat on a normalized basis and the margin environment speaks first in North America primarily United States, which is two-thirds of the company that's growing kind of mid single-digits call it 5% transactionally. It's kind of hard to separate product from new sales, because obviously what our sales folks are selling, particularly in some of our business units like Heartland but are also in OpenEdge and also in school and campus Heartland commerce, what they are selling are in many cases new products.",0.2103203,0.731
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,100,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"What I would say is at this point, American Express, OptBlue, which is something we sell last time talking about probably a couple of years ago as, I don't know like, Cameron, probably double or triple anniversary at this point. So large, stepwise functions of products that really neatly shift the revenue curve in a certain direction either double or triple anniversary those at this point here in the United States, obviously, we do a lot of these things all the time, but in terms of looking for those kind of quantum leap things, we just posted, as Cameron said, 11% or 12% depending on how you calculate legacy Global, legacy Heartland, U.S. direct growth business, yes, as we double or triple anniversary, something like AmEx and OptBlue. So clearly the majority of what is driving the growth is just better sales execution targeted at more attractive end markets. As you know, here in the U.S., we are primarily SME-focused not just at OpenEdge but also at Heartland. And I think historically, that's been a very good place to be and I think going forward with some of the things that happened the last couple of quarters in the election and everything else, I think that will continue to be a very attractive place to be. So, new product sales are something we knew all the time, but as you can see from our performance this quarter and over the last year or so, we certainly don't need to see step-like functions for us to continue to grow at rates like we have been growing at the last period of time.",0.4462633,0.994
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,101,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,David E. Mangum,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, I think Dan, I agree with that first it is about taking market share not about cross-sells, maybe I will push it just a little bit, if the question is really particularly about strategic initiatives for brand new cross-sells whether that's Heartland in cross-selling Heartland technology or global payments technology across the Heartland base and then broadening that for initiatives like the OpenEdge initiative I commented on earlier to Oscar's question, we are really just getting started on those. So you can see the beginnings of what we think can be the returns of that in the revenue enhancement guidance that Cameron set. Think ahead to '18, I am very confident these are going to be really meaningful numbers from '18 and beyond. We are planting seeds for all these cross-sells. We are planting seeds for these cross-sells right now. And in some ways, they are just getting started where what described is the way we run the business everyday. It's cross-sell. It's new products that we can sell in North America, then to UK, then to Asia as well. So, lots more to come I think over some period of time.",0.8591549,0.944
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,103,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I would say you have hit an important point there. So if you go back to I think we were answering to a previous question about our mix of businesses, so we were talking about technology enabled back certainly when we partnered with APT in 2012 and if you think back to October '15 Analyst Day we talked about tech-enabled being a third of the company driving 8% of revenue. We have got a bunch of our peers who have come out and said they hope to get in that business one day. I think it's important to understand that more people increasingly are selling is less of the traditional wholesale like sales referrals that you asked is the beginning part of your question and more of the products and services that are really dedicated to technology-enabled sales that are distinctive distribution team. So I do think you are seeing some of that in our numbers. I would talk it up to good strategy and good execution rather than step-like functions in a product where I certainly think we are seeing the benefits of having made those investments over time.",0.475089,0.97
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,105,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, both good questions, Dan. I didn't you a specific estimate for realized synergies in calendar 2017, so you are right to pickup on that. My expectation is about $90 million of realized synergies in calendar 2017. So that will translate into an exit rate of about 110, from which we will scale from there as we get into calendar 2018 as we wrap up a lot of the technology work that will get us to that overall 135 run-rate target that we are now seeking as the company. Secondly, to your other question, we are going to fill out calendar 2016 results when we finalize our stub period audits, which we are in the midst of beginning right now and file our 10-K for the transition period, it's a 10-K T, which we would expect to file towards the end of February or early March. That is a 10-K for the 7-month period from June 1 to December 31. Once we get that work done, we will fill out the calendars for 2016, so you can see obviously actual results for all of calendar 2016 as well as the quarterly distribution of results. Naturally, as you can tell from the growth rates we have given you today for our calendar 2017 guide you can back into our current estimate for calendar 2016 recognized that's based on 11 months of actual and 1 month of estimate for December as we are still in the process of closing those books.",0.8590747,0.852
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,112,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it, Dave. We will anniversary or did anniversary the pricing benefits in December that came into effect in the UK. We are seeing good, strong fundamental performance in the UK as we talked about in our prepared comments, double-digit growth led by very strong transaction and volume growth in market, but we are going to anniversary those pricing benefits which will create a little of a headwind as we go into the beginning of the year. I would say, Spain, Q2, fantastic performance again building off of market leading transaction and volume trends and the execution there has been superb. Our partnership with Caixa remains I think the gold standard for bank-based JVs around the world and continues to perform exceptionally well. So as we go into Q1, I think we feel good about how we are positioned in Europe, which obviously gives rise to our guide for the calendar year. Obviously, that's going to be impacted fairly significantly by FX headwinds largely from the pound in Europe.",0.666548,0.988
GPN-2017-Q2-2017-01-09,114,Answer,2017-01-09,2,2017,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"It's probably going to be high single is my estimate, Dave, for Europe. It did probably double-digit in Q2. But again, as we go into the year, I would say, our expectation is the region the segment is going to perform kind of at our cycle guidance which would be high single-digit growth organically. Obviously, our guidance reflects a range of possible outcomes around the variety of factors including growth. But I think our base case assumption going into the year is that the Europe produces high single-digit organic growth. You get a little bit of benefit from not having anniversarying the Erste joint venture until June. And then obviously that produces an overall mid-teens expectation that ends up being mid-single when you factor in the fairly significant decline in the pound and euro in particular as well as the check run.",0.647331,0.909

That also ties into the inorganic point as we mentioned before, there are many transactions we look at around the world but especially for these purposes in Europe that had issuing elements and acquiring element and historically Global Payments will look at those and say, I'm good at acquiring but I don't really have an issuing scale presence to marry up with the issuing assets in those targets.",1.2530249,0.494
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,126,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"TSYS of course we do the same thing they would look at those business in Europe and they would say, we're delighted with the issuing opportunities, but we're not in acquiring on outside of United States.",1.0950178,0.768
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,127,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, certainly as I think about organic but also inorganic opportunities in Europe, the combination of issuing acquiring I think may put us in a unrivaled position relative to anybody else to be a strategic partner to those assets and I'd say both companies have a long history of durable, extensible, bank partnerships worldwide as they mention prepared remarks on the combination of TSYS and Global Payments results in a sophisticated financial institution based of 1300 FI's around the world and I would tell you that durably and extensibility of those partnerships is unmatched relative to all of our direct peers.",0.9462633,0.92

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,133,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"If you look at Visa data which I think reflects I think fairly accurate what we're seeing in the marketplace, I think consumer spending declined in the first half of the year, something like 1.1%, 1.2% something in that range. So, we're obviously seeing the impact of Brexit sort of manifest themselves and consumer confidence in the market. We continue to grow in local currency in the UK. So, we're certainly pleased about that. We continue our trend of growing above the rate of market growth.",1.5740971,0.932

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"In the UK, but obviously, it's not at the same level that we had been growing in the 2018 timeframe, or even in Q1 for that matter.

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,135,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, it's not a particularly big exposure for us going forward.

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,136,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Again, we're well diversified across the continent, the trends that we're seeing in the UK really haven't -- I'd say infected the rest of Europe and our cross-border business in Europe. For e-com omni remains very strong, tailwind for our growth in the overall region.

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,138,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, sure. So, the only I would add to what Cameron said on the UK, as you probably have one of the best new sales periods in the first half of 2019 with new sales in the UK for us at the very significant percentage. Well, in excess of our historical numbers, the last number of years, year-over-year. So, as Cameron said, we like our positioning there. And the rest of Europe seems to be separate in terms of its economic growth, you can see that reflect our numbers.",1.3120996,0.952
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,139,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"On SCA, I think these said the same thing, Brian, that the regulators I think, smartly. Even though, the rule becomes effective in September of 2019, have provide some guidance that as long as people continue to make progress, that that will be ruled out really over a 12-month period from September of 2019, I suppose through September of 2020.

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,142,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So certainly, it's something we're focused on. We think we're ready for it. I would say that over the next 12 months, particularly since TSYS will close a bit earlier now. We're in a unique position, I really mean unique, because the presence of TSYS on the issue inside in the United Kingdom, in Western Europe, in Ireland with the business that they have marrying that issuing solution presents with the acquiring solution that Global Payments has in those markets will allow us.

So, on the first one, and listen, I think our philosophy on marrying issuing with acquiring and not needing a gateway to do it. It's not all that unique to us, and not all that new to us. I think it's similar to what we said in May.",1.1576512,0.318
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,151,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, some of the examples I gave, I just finished talking to Bryan and in response to Bryan's question about strong customer authentication, our ability to validate as a flood matter those transactions without having to go outside the four walls of Global Payments and TSYS is unique to us, and that's one of the thing that I meant when I talked about marrying issuing with acquiring.",1.7234875,0.802

So, if you look at the construct of new Pfizer, or new Fidelity, the way they get at this, and by the way, they only get at in one market, i.e. the United States.

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,153,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, number one, we don't actually need to own a gateway and compete with the car brands who are very good at doing that, in order to affect the solutions that I'm describing. Instead, we do it technologically. Hence, the source of my commentary about providing superior return capabilities for our shareholders and for our customers, because we actually do it through tech, we actually need to own the underlying processing in its own right.

So, I think we'll have a double advantage of the one I think it's a better mousetrap as it relates to construction of the solution.

First of all, you're right in terms of how the combined business will be positioned upon closing, we expect to be roughly 2.5 times levered on a pro forma basis, we expect to have an investment great balance sheet generated in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion of year of EBITDA on a pro forma basis and $2.5 billion of free cash flow again on a pro forma basis.",1.634807,0.863

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I would say however, our first and foremost priority upon closing the transaction is going to be to ensure that the combined business is coming together that we're well-positioned as a go-to market strategy, that integration is going smoothly, and that we're executing on and delivering on the commitments that we've made as part of the merger with TSYS. However, obviously, as time passes, we're going to have a lot of capacity to continue to pursue that discipline capital allocation strategy that we have historically.",1.9159402,0.477
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,159,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I think you should expect that it's going to be focused on many of the same things that we have been focused on historically. Obviously, we're very bullish of our software driven payment strategy. So clearly, adding more vertical software businesses that fit the TSYS, that have the right nexus between obviously SaaS software components and Nexus with payments that allows us to grow both the software side of the business and the payment opportunity and to monetize that effectively, as a combined business will be a core part of the capital allocation strategy.",1.5236613,0.937
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,160,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think to Jeff's point earlier, we do continue to see opportunities, particularly with our new issuing capabilities to combine those with acquiring capabilities to pursue additional joint ventures and acquisitions outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe and LatAm for example, where we think those capabilities will be distinctive in terms of our ability to compete for assets in those markets. And obviously, that'll continue to be a part of the capital allocation strategy as well.",1.8985056,0.772
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,161,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And then lastly, I would say, and I want to reemphasize our commitment to maintaining the investment grade balance sheet going forward. Obviously, that is something that as a combined company will pride ourselves on having and we certainly remain committed to maintaining that going forward and maintaining leverage at a level that will support that investment grade balance sheet.",1.8328144,0.889
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,162,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"But that being said, we obviously will have ample capacity, I think to pursue a capital allocation strategy that allows us to effectively do the things we've been doing now for the last five to six years in terms of growing and expanding the business globally.",2.1927148,0.557
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,168,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yeah, it's a great question Ashwin. I would say just to be honest, the revenue, sorry, the lowest hanging fruits right here in the United States with the merchant business. So, I gave you few examples, in response to I think David's question earlier this morning.",1.9637011,0.859
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,169,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, if you just look at the area of most direct overlaps here in the United States in merchant, there are products and services that TSYS has and I gave Vital POS as an example, NTR certifications would be another one, that Global Payments and Heartland are not as well positioned in today.",2.0220641,0.492
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,171,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, as it relates to revenue enhancement acceleration, there is a lot of low hanging fruit right here, and that's on the complexity that you just referred to as it relates to those multinational FI partners.",1.1352313,-0.273
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,172,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"There is a lot of overlap and a lot of ability to - from a product, from a technology point of view to drive incremental revenue right here in the immediate term. I think Cameron was alluding to this, when he talked about a lot of the things being front end loaded, rather than more traditionally, kind of middle and back end, as you might see, in other transactions. So, I think that's the area that's right down the middle of place.",1.0669039,0.318
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,173,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Now, if you step back further, to your point, and you say, well, what else can we do? So, one example would be and Global Payments is doing this already, but TSYS is absolutely going to help immediately is we're already out pitching, you see all this stuff in the newspaper coming out with large FI here domestically have said, we don't think we have the ability to sell cross-border multinational e-com and omnichannel corporate customers at the banks that we'd like to have today.",1.483274,0.893
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,174,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, here's an example of large MNCs where Global Payments is already pitching this stuff today with our unified commerce platform I talked about at the beginning of my prepared remarks. Well, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind, and that's straight sales pitch.",0.1427046,0.422
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,175,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"In my mind that TSYS helps accelerate that strategy immediately. So, TSYS can provide additional avenues into more multinational FI that we don't have. And that's a sales pitch that we're already executing on today.",1.7345196,0.382
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,176,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I would say now, we're saying the complexity of some of the folks that you just mentioned, there is no doubt in my mind that there are immediate opportunities to help accelerate revenue enhancement, in addition to some elements of the merchant business.",1.8177936,0.153
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,177,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The last thing I'd point out on the same TSYS side, I think its immediate, so maybe immediate to medium term area is the NetSpend. So, I want to make sure we just got that which is to say that their merchant business at TSYS and their NetSpend business at TSYS is a U.S. only business, say for historical reasons.",2.0590747,0.439
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,178,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Well Cameron and I, we're in a number of markets over the last number of months, there is no reason that many of those businesses, merchant we already do overseas. But let's just take NetSpend for this example. There is no reason that business can exist in markets outside the United States.",1.5576512,0.273
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,179,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, certainly with our footprint with the combined companies scale and scope, our ability to bring NetSpend on prepaid to markets outside the United States is something we're very optimistic about. And by the way, that's not a two-year undertaking, that's something I expect to see happen in the next 12 months.",0.8708185,0.855
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,180,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I think very different than some of the other transactions that have been announced. There really is a fair amount of confidence in our near-term ability to affect many of the strategic things on the revenue enhancement side that we've described.",0.8601423,0.801
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,181,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Ashwin, maybe just to build on that a little bit further, as we think about the revenue synergy potential in the business, all the things that Jeff described, but generally think about as organic things that we can do, or start to do day one as a combined company.",1.0080946,0.0

GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,183,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I really think of that is incremental, frankly, on top of the revenue synergies that we've targeted generally, because there's investment that's going to go behind the need or the ability to expand into a new market or to establish a new joint venture as we have historically.",0.5295766,0.66
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,184,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, to your point, to the extent that were able to do that, yeah, on the top line that may eclipse the overall revenue targets that we've established as part of the deal, but I really think about that as being largely incremental to store the organic opportunities that Jeff highlighted in his prepared remarks. And then again, obviously and his response to your question.",1.6425903,0.775
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,186,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, it's a good question, Ashwin. So, I would say for the full year, I expect currency to be anywhere between a 20 to 30 basis point headwind on margin and probably 400-ish basis points on the bottom-line.",1.5292653,0.625
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,187,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So yes, we've quantified it as a top-line basis, largely because again, we've maintained the current revenue guide, which really is a function of the incremental revenue headwinds from foreign currency offsetting the strong momentum kind of we have in the business. So, we still feel good about the overall revenue target.",1.3950809,0.848
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,188,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"But obviously, the execution we've been able to achieve over the course of the year gives -- positions us well to achieve an increase in our overall expectations around margin expansion and earnings per share for the full year. So, the way I generally think about it is the earnings guide is 16% to 18%.",1.7008095,0.681
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,189,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Interestingly, that's our roughly our cycle guidance in terms of earnings target growth, but that's absorbing probably 300 to 400 basis points of currency in earnings. So really on a constant currency basis, that's north of 20%, which I think is a really strong number as an earnings matter for the business.",1.5292653,0.861
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,194,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, David, its Cameron, so I think your math is pretty good to be honest with you. I've got North America kind of normalized constant currency growth in the quarter of about 9.5% pretty close to what you what you suggested and X wholesale, that's almost a point higher, so closer to 10.5%, which is really at the high end of our cycle guidance.",1.4215442,0.947
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,195,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Obviously, the U.S. Direct business is north of that, which, again, reflects continued very strong performance across our integrated and vertical market channel as well as our relationship channel continues to perform really well.",1.2512453,0.778
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,196,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, I think the short answer to your question is yes, the back-half expectation sitting here today is that those trends can persist around those same levels. I think we feel good about the momentum we have in the business and notwithstanding, the incremental currency headwinds, we're absorbing and revenue, the way we're really offsetting that is strength in the North America business and more particular strength in the US Direct channels that continue to help us absorb incremental FX in regions outside of the US.",1.1749689,0.929
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,197,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, the long and short of it is yes, the expectation for the balance of the year is that this level of performance in the North American business persists. And we continue to feel good about the momentum that we have as we enter into Q3 and Q4 as a revenue matter.",0.5912204,0.691
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,199,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, I would look at its extra timing items that we've sort of highlighted on the schedule, because I think that's the best representation of really cash it's in the business and available for us. And if tracking close to $0.5 billion for the first half, so we're on target for the billion dollars target we have for the full year.",1.3029265,0.751
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,200,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"There is a lot of noise in that sort of timing items, some of it is flip between reduction of liabilities, but it's coming out of restricted cash, because we're holding customer cash then rolls out in the next quarter. So, it's the best way to look at it sort of extra timing items the way that we've highlighted on the trended financial statement. That's really the cash that's in the business and available for us to utilize.",1.489726,0.526
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,206,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Steven, it's Jeff, I'll start on the U.S. wholesale. I'm sure Cameron will comment on the rates question. So, what I would say is if you back up and you look at how we think about it, when I came to Global Payments, the U.S. wholesale business was probably 50%, if not more of the US business, number one.",1.2117438,0.649
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,207,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Number two, we also lacked in addition to math, we also lacked the diversity of distribution. So, with the exception of our gaming business, with the exception of APT when we bought it in 2012, we didn't really have a lot of direct sales in the United States away from the wholesale business. So, I think those two things really drove on the strategy that we've been talking about for last four or five years which is the same emphasis that the direct business and less of an emphasis on the wholesale business.",1.2615658,0.477
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,208,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We're lowering that position, so we have plenty of direct distribution on a combined basis with TSYS the wholesale business partner 5% of the commodity company but probably most important this event we have a lot of direct distribution affable payments and certainly at TSYS.",1.4896797,0.642
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,209,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I don't think about it the same way as I thought about it in six or seven years ago, because those two issues we have there predominate Global Payments which is to say lack of diversity of distribution and concentration are not issued the Global Payments have today but especially for these purposes, there are not issues that pieces in Global Payments will have.",1.4572954,-0.166
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,210,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So, I certainly think we feel very different about that, I would also add in there that Global Payments historically going back six or seven years have a lot of concentration among very few customers in the ISO business, TSYS doesn't have that either. So, I think going forward too much better mouse trap overall with a combined companies and I don't think we approach it the same way rather I think we look at it openly and think about what's the best thing for the combined business.",1.6523132,0.817
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,211,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And Steven on your rate question I'll start by saying of course loss on us that we're in a very attractive rate environment in general and I will start with the credit agreement that we executed earlier in July, we were delighted with the outcome of that, we prized our revolving credit facility in term loan A, given our expected credit rating and LIBOR plus 137.5% basis points, which is obviously an improvement over where our pricing is today and interestingly where TSYS is as well.",0.876401,0.976
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,212,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, we feel good about gotten that aspect of the permanent capital structure in place at very attractive terms. The remaining aspect of the capital structure that we need to put in place prior to closing is really in expectation around about $2.5 billion senior notes offering that we expect to execute here over the coming months as we lead up to closing of the transaction and actually to your points we recognize at the rate environment in which to get that done is pretty attractive for us today.",1.3732877,0.914
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,213,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We also recognize that, given the mix of the business geographically particularly overseas there can potentially be opportunities for us to take advantage even at lower rate environment in the UK and Europe that would allow us to lower the overall cost of debt for the pro forma business as well.",1.8281445,0.178
GPN-2019-Q2-2019-07-30,214,Answer,2019-07-30,2,2019,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, more to come on that as we continue to execute against our plans to establish the permanent capital structure for the combined business between now and close but I would say certainly the rate environment that were seeing and the execution we been able to achieve thus far gives us a lot of confidence that there's some potential upside as relates to the accretion expectations we have for the transaction on the heels better-than-expected financing rates.",1.8132005,0.82

Because of the actions we took early in the pandemic and our consistency and execution, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, positioning us well heading into 2021.

GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,12,Remarks,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"But it's worth noting that in the last six months, we have struck significant and unique distribution relationships with two of the world's largest and most respected technology companies, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. This is a first for the payments technology industry. And we did this in the midst of a once in a century pandemic, while delivering adjusted earnings per share growth and gaining market share.

For the full-year, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $6.75 billion, down 5% compared to 2019 on a combined basis. Importantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points on a combined basis to 39.7%, as we benefited from the broad expense actions we implemented to address the impact of the pandemic and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which continue to track ahead of plan. It is worth highlighting that our full-year adjusted operating margin performance was largely consistent with the guidance we gave at the start of 2020 and prior to the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $6.40, an increase of 3% over 2019.

Adjusted operating margin was 41.5%, a 320 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019.

Indeed, booking trends across our vertical markets portfolio remains solid, providing us with a positive tailwind heading into 2021. We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business saw adjusted net revenue returned to slight growth for the fourth quarter, enabled by the innovative technology and software solutions we are delivering in this channel.

Transaction volumes recovered further, while traditional accounts on file continued to grow, setting a new record. Additionally, our bundled pricing model, including value-added products and services, also benefited performance. Excluding our commercial card business, which represents approximately 20% of our Issuer portfolio and is being impacted by the slow recovery in corporate travel, this segment delivered low single-digit growth for the quarter. Notably, this business achieved record adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 450 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new record of 44.7%, as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business.

Gross dollar volume increased more than 5% for the quarter, a result including little impact from the late December incremental stimulus, which we expect to primarily benefit us in Q1. We are particularly pleased with trends with our DDA products which includes an acceleration in active account growth of 29% compared to the prior year.

We made great progress on our integration during the crisis, which I mentioned, continues to track ahead of plan. As a result, we are pleased to again raise our estimate for annual run rate expense synergies from the merger to at least $400 million within 3 years, up from the previous estimate of $375 million. This marks the fourth time we have increased our cost synergy expectations. Additionally, our early success in leveraging our complementary products and capabilities worldwide also gives us the confidence to increase our expectation for annual run rate synergies, again, to $150 million, up from our previous forecast of $125 million. From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted free cash flow of roughly $780 million for the quarter and approximately $2 billion for the year. These are both records for us. This is after reinvesting $107 million of CapEx for the quarter and $436 million for the year.

This outlook is consistent with the high end of our long-term target of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, and it is also reflects the benefit of the year-on-year comparisons due to the pandemic. Considering this top line forecast, we would expect to deliver normalized adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points, given the natural operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this will be partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of 2020.

We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit growth range and above our mid-single-digit growth target. These trends should be normalized for two distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we will be absorbing the impact of a portfolio sale by one of our customers, which will impact us for the remainder of the year.

Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full-year in a range of $7.75 to $8.05, reflecting growth of 21% to 26% over 2020.

So basically, what we are really trying to do is create an even more differentiated portal offering to our customer base by enhancing our existing value-added services with Google products and capabilities that exist in the market today.",0.2310087,0.925
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,59,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And then further as we co-develop and innovate new products with Google, we will obviously look to layer those into the portal environment as well. The nice thing about portal environment is completely self-select. Our customers can choose what products and solutions that they need to run and grow their business and they will be able to effectively determine the pricing outcome that they desire based on their need for products and services.",0.1618929,0.888
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,60,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So like anything else we do, there will be different levels of availability to customers from lower end, very basic to mid-market, to higher end complete sets that will have different price points associated with them. But end of the day, the idea is our customers have the opportunity to self-select the product, services, capabilities and solutions they need to run and grow their businesses more effectively. And by working with Google, we expect to be able to innovate new products and capabilities that will be distinctive in the marketplace for them.",0.7325654,0.952

And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the Merchant side, I think you talked about mid to high-teens growth. Can you give us any help kind of by segment thinking about relationship software? Obviously, that probably recovers stronger and integrated. Just by the pieces, maybe what those growth rates might look like to get to that mid to high-teens growth? Thanks.",0.2851806,0.735
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,62,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Sure, Bryan. It's Cameron. Maybe I'll start with just a little commentary about the expectations for the business and I'll let Paul jump in with a few more of the details. So I would say if you look at the business overall, given that North America represents about 70% of the Merchant business globally, obviously, it's going to drive the lion's share of the outcome for the entire segment for the full-year.",0.0395392,0.802

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I would say we are looking for pretty good recoveries, obviously, in the payments and payroll business as well as the integrated business in the U.S. So I would say both of those would be towards the higher end of that targeted expectation that we have for the merchant business in aggregate.",0.5239726,0.896
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,64,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And as the vertical markets that we participate in continue to recover as well, we would expect our vertical market business to be towards the higher end of that range also just given, obviously, the impacts on 2020 for that business as well as a strong new sales performance that we saw in 2020 giving us good momentum kind of heading into 2021 as we start to lap the impacts of the pandemic.",0.1668742,0.321
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,65,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think, Europe, our expectations are a little more modest. They're probably in that kind of mid-teens range, just given some of the incremental impacts of new shutdowns and restrictions in the first part of the year in Europe. And maybe just a slightly more benign expectation around the recovery environment in Europe, particularly as it relates to cross-border throughout the course of 2021.",0.0435866,0.92

I would tell you, Bryan, that basically assumes kind of an ongoing gradual recovery from where we are today.",0.258406,0.128
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,68,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We've seen results in January that are better than December. And we expect the recovery to continue to grind higher through the balance of the year. Such that by the time we're exiting '21, we expect domestic volumes to be more normalized. And obviously, we think cross-border is going to continue to lag slightly kind of heading into 2022. And that's consistent with the commercial card commentary that Paul provided in his script.",0.3325031,0.393
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,69,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"So we are not expecting a heroic recovery as we think about the outlook for 2021. We expect a gradual recovery kind of throughout the year. We know it won't be linear. There'll be puts and takes as we continue to progress throughout the year. But by and large, expect a continued gradual recovery, and that's really what supports the overall Merchant expectation for the year. Paul, I don't know if you would add anything to that.",0.5828402,0.758
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,70,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. The only thing I would add, I think you covered it. It would just be the quarterly phasing of that, Bryan. I kind of referenced that in the script. But obviously, in the first quarter, we have really a pre-pandemic affected comparison that kind of lends sort of more muted growth there. And the second quarter is just the opposite. Those two kind of blend out to that mid to high rate that we're talking about. And then the last half of the year is pretty consistent with that mid to high rate. So I think that gives a little more color on the quarterly pay thing.",0.1629893,0.942
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,71,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. And the only other thing I would add to that, Bryan, is we don't need a heroic recovery or perfection you're going to get to the higher end of the range. So obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty heading into the year, and I think our guidance accommodates that. But we don't need perfection and some sort of heroic recovery where everything is kind of back to normal by midyear for us to get to the higher end of the range that we put forward today.",0.5672598,0.74

So you mentioned this in the Google press release and then also Cameron in the prepared remarks around the distribution of not just payments acceptance, but also loyalty, gift card, payroll, capital access was mentioned and other financial services. Maybe you could talk a little bit more broadly about not only the opportunity within the Google relationship, but also how much runway there might be for embedding these offerings with your 4,000 other software platforms and partners within the global integrated Global Payments integrated business?",0.2534247,0.935
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,76,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. It's a really good question. So there is really two elements of that. There's one, obviously, the co-sell relationship that we'll have with Google as it relates to our go-to-market strategy going forward. And obviously, being able to work with Google Cloud, co-sell solutions with them, having them refer business into us from a payment standpoint creates a strong new technology-enabled distribution stream that really, I think, augments and complements our existing go-to-market strategies very nicely.",0.393213,0.783
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,77,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we're delighted about that and think there's a lot that we can do together with Google to drive new revenue growth in the business through this cross-sell relationship. And then reflecting back a little bit on the comments that I made to Bryan's question, if you think about the business, these solutions will be delivered through our cloud-based digital portal that is in operation today and running in Google Cloud today.",0.0124533,0.178
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,78,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M.

GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,79,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So since it's all consolidated on the back end, those merchant customers will have the ability to access all of those value-added solutions and capabilities, whether or not they are a traditional relationship-led customer coming through us through that channel or they are an integrated customer coming through us through an ISV relationship. And we think that's unique and distinctive to Global Payments, our ability to integrate those solutions and make them available through a digital portal to the entire suite of customers that we serve around the globe.",1.3627024,0.735
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,82,Question,2021-02-08,4,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Thank you. Congrats, Jeff, Cameron and Paul. You guys have been quite big in a lot of investments and announcements to absorb here. It's good to see. I guess one question I had, obviously, heading into '21 a lot of moving parts that you addressed on the prepared remarks. But if you don't mind, could you kind of, in one place, kind of go through the cadence of how you expect overall segment revenue and profits to perform over the course of the year by segment, particularly thinking of comps, synergy, unwind of early pandemic cost, things like that?",1.3402367,0.921
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,83,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Sure, Ashwin. We kind of hit on it a little bit on the merchant side in the earlier question around kind of that phasing and that same kind of concept kind of plays through to a large degree with other segments, particularly as it relates to the pre-pandemic comp in 1Q and then the pandemic comp going the other way in the second quarter and then kind of more normalized in the back half of the year. So clearly, that's the case in Merchant. And that mid to high-teens growth rate, as I said kind of averages out between the first two quarters with those two impacts and then is pretty consistent for the back two quarters. On the issuing side, as we said, from a kind of organic standpoint, we start kind of that mid to high growth rate. And then if we are going to actually look to be it or a low single-digit as a reported matter, the only thing I would highlight there is we did not assume commercial card recovering throughout the year. So that's a headwind that plays itself out throughout the whole year. I would say we also have some - in addition to just the pre-pandemic comps, we also have some headwinds as it relates to just credit transaction volumes in the issuing business year-over-year as - and we're seeing consistent with what the Visa numbers that they talked about for January. And as Cameron mentioned earlier, we did see improvement from January to December, but we still have some headwind on the transaction volume side and issuing that will play itself through the first quarter.",0.7577663,0.917
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,84,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And then on the Business and Consumer side, we kind of talked about it. We've got some tailwind as it relates to stimulus in the first quarter and then kind of more normalized kind of that mid single-digit growth rate that we talked about for the remaining three quarters. As it relates to expenses and margin, there isn't anything necessary on the expense side. Obviously, where - we've done a really good job over the last two quarters of managing that expense rate to a pretty consistent year-over-year growth rate of roughly about 8%. And there's nothing I would necessarily highlight other than the variable expenses that come with that revenue that I would call out on the expense side. So obviously, we're very pleased to be in a position to yet again have a very impressive margin expansion as a consolidated matter. We did, as we said in our prepared remarks, have a much higher weighting of that margin expansion on the Merchant side than we did this last year, but we still expect to have nice margin expansion in both Issuing and Business and Consumer. And there wouldn't be necessarily anything on a quarterly basis I could call out there.",0.5273669,0.701
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,85,Question,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Got it. And then capital allocation, it's good to see the incremental buyback announcement. I mean can you speak to the M&A pipeline though from a capital allocation perspective? Has your traditional view on making accretive acquisitions maybe changed in favor of acquisitions that might help revenue growth a little bit more, but not be accretive to the bottom line?",1.6644128,0.978

GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,90,Question,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Hi, thanks guys. I want to go back just to follow-up on the capital allocation perimeter. We ended the year last year with some headlines over consolidation with is in the news and you guys. And it was obviously, at the time, rumors. But Jeff, if you could just revisit for us your vision of the industry for a minute in terms of the merits of consolidation scale versus your view of what you're clearly doing now, which is investing in yourselves around omni-channel and cloud and other initiatives. I'd love to just hear your view on long-term, next few years, where you see the industry adding?",0.1466192,0.983
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,91,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Thanks, Darrin. It's Jeff. So look, we're in a scale business. I think that's always been true. That continues to be true today and that's going to be true tomorrow. So having more scale in the scale business is always a good idea. I think we've shown this with Harland. I think we've shown it with TSYS partnership. So I don't think having scale in the technology business is really ever going to go out of favor. I think the fruit's in the pudding, and you saw that in 2020, right, double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter coming out of the depression while the networks are shrinking. I don't think you have to look further than that to realize that, that was a good idea. So I think at the end of day, those type of scale economies will drive further consolidation. But it's not just consolidation for consolidation's sake. I think the reasons in part that we look for further scale of opportunities is to make more investments back in our businesses. If you look at the areas that are growing most quickly for us during the pandemic, look at our omni-channel business, which accelerated again to the high teens in the fourth quarter of '20, which, by the way, Google is going on too Under our UCP product, look at our integrated business, which showed absolute growth in the fourth quarter and for the year, those are businesses, and of course, our software businesses, which did as well in certain of their vertical markets like AdvancedMD. Those are all businesses where we've made very substantial investments in over the last number of years. We couldn't make those investments worldwide as we're doing if we didn't have the scale in the first place.",0.1192171,0.936
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,92,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So listen, my own view on the - in the business is we need to continue to invest in those areas that we think are ripe for future growth. We never could have pivoted this quickly to omni-channel to safer commerce if we hadn't had those on the product development board in the first place and if we didn't have the access to capital that we do from free cash flow, like to continue to make those investments. So in those context, obviously, additional scale makes sense. But very similar to the response, Darrin, because he has a very similar question to Ashwin, at the end of the day, none of that changes the strategy, really that we've been running the company with over the last 7 years plus, which is to say, focus on the 3 prongs at the end of the day, software partnership and ownership, on omni-channel acceptance and delivery and on the most attractive market. So the nice thing about 2020 with all the challenges it on every one of us was that it really validated all things that we've been talking about. So if we can find future transactions or partnerships that align with the 3 things that we've been talking about since 2013, but of course, scale and a scale business is going to be a good idea. So I think we view '20 and the recent events as really the validation of all stuff that we've been talking about. If we can find further ways to accelerate those investments, then we will.",0.0181495,0.962
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,93,Question,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up, Jeff, you guys outperformed your Merchant business in the quarter. And I mean it's pretty clear that it's a tough quarter from a Merchant standpoint for revenue to really read a lot into what's happening, given mix. But if you can give us any more color on the actual bookings kind of trends in the sense of number of merchants you're adding. It seems like with all the initiatives you are holding up and you are actually gaining share, but it's easier to see that if we had numbers around the number of merchants or bookings. So any more color on what happened there? So we know what could look like when it reopens? Thanks again guys.",0.0535492,0.998

I wanted a follow-up question on the Google partnership. And just in light of the Amazon partnership also from earlier this year, can you just maybe give it a high level compare and contrast the two a little bit? I know, obviously, Google is focused on Merchant, Amazon focused on Issuer. And just more strategically, I guess what do you - how do you see those impacting your business in 2021, 2022 and beyond? Thank you.",0.3074733,0.985
GPN-2020-Q4-2021-02-08,99,Answer,2021-02-08,4,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Lisa. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'm sure Cameron. It's an excellent question. So both businesses, both TSYS and Global Payments have had historical relationships with each of Amazon and Google for many years. So I think we've had a first row seat as to what those companies look like. We have a lot of respect for each. So why don't I start with AWS? So our Issuer folks have worked with them for a number of years as part of their modernization initiatives. We've been very, very happy with them. I think you have to realize that it's a slightly different proposition that we're undertaking in the Issuer versus Merchant. So on the Issuer side, it's technology modernization and transformation really at the same time, which is to say that code is going from more of a legacy code into cloud-enabled, able where it probably is today, and then into cloud-native ultimately, while it's being lifted and shifted over to a cloud-hosted environment. So in the case of Google Hub, on the Merchant side, we're really already there. Our businesses are really either cloud-enabled or cloud native already in their own rights. So the Google proposition is a little bit different on the technology side. It's more of a shift rather than a lift and shift in the case of the Merchant business. I would say in the case of each, the go-to-market proposition though is very similar. We think AWS has a very distinctive and strong proposition among financial institution issuers. You can look up a lot of folks that they announced recently going to AWS Cloud. But we've had, as we said in our prepared remarks, we had very good experience already with one announced win and I think 3 to 4, we said are already mid to high probabilities in the pipeline. And probably another 4 or 5 that are lower probabilities, but also in the pipeline on the co-sell with AWS in the Issuer environment. So we view AWS, and I think it's been proven so far in our experience today as having fantastic technologies, which we need for a long time, but also having terrific distribution to in the FI segment. Google, of course, has very many of the same things, but we view the Google co-sell more on the Merchant side, which is what Cameron was talking about, too. And really, there's two pieces there that are also unique. So in the case of AWS, that's a unique co-sell in FI land in the case of Google, it's unique co-sell into merchant land. And on the merchant side, it's really two pieces, as Cameron's articulated with Google. The first one really is embedding their products and services uniquely into our already live Merchant portal, which, by the way, is already resonant for Global Payments and has been for years in the Google Cloud already, right? So we already have that. We are just blending their products into our Merchant cloud environment more seamlessly. And then the second piece, similar to AWS is a co-sale, meaning there's actual quota at the Google level for Google sales reps to sell our products and services into the Google base. And we also have that ability of selling Google's products and services into our portal like environment, which Cameron described some time ago. Very similar to what we're doing with AWS, there's quota on their sales reps and selling on the FI base. So while I would say that they are very similar in the sense of contract, they are a bit different when you think about where their target Issuer versus Merchant and when you think about the nature of the lifting shift that's really going on in the case of the AWS side and the Google side is more of a shift.",0.0485679,0.991

Just thinking about the adjusted operating margin as we go into the second quarter, how should we think about modeling given that it's likely the second quarter will be hopefully the bottom of the impact or will be the worst of the impact in the second quarter? And with that, thinking about the $400 million of additional cost saves, where is that coming from exactly? And is that sustainable post the COVID-19 impact after we get a year out? Thanks.",0.3794326,0.605
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,77,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So Bryan, this is Paul. As it relates to the margin, I'd say a couple of things. One, obviously, we're very pleased to have the margin expansion at the 300 basis point level that we had in Q1. So that kind of gives you a run rate of where we were at from a total quarter standpoint. The second thing I'd point to is these additional cost takeouts. And if you kind of look at that on a year-over-year basis, you could see that that's roughly about 6.5% or so if you took that 100 million per quarter and clip those in the quarters, that would kind of give you the first addition there that you would make on what we would do on the margin side.",0.9881657,0.709
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,78,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"And then last, as you just kind of make your assumptions as it relates to what volume would do from a revenue side and kind of the incremental kind of cost there, you could just try to take those margins and kind of play through the various businesses. And that would give you kind of the margin picture you were looking for. You are right in the sense that 2Q, particularly in light of the recovery in volumes that we're seeing, would be the trough from a margin standpoint. But we certainly are moving into this quarter here in a very strong position with the cost initiatives that we already have in place.",1.1982249,0.796
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,79,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And I'd say, on your second question, Bryan, about the $400 million and the - how it looks going forward, I would say probably about half that, call it, about $200 million, I would say our permanent ongoing reductions. The other $200 million are really things that we've done like salary reductions and everything else in light of the virus. Having said that, though, if we were to face a situation where things didn't continue to improve, obviously, we would do other things to get back to the $400 million in the first place.",0.3213523,0.66
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,80,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I believe at the end of the day, it's going to depend on what we see. As Paul mentioned, we continue to see stabilization and improvement in the volumes. But if we don't continue to see that, then I'm confident that we'll take other actions to return to the $400 million in the first place.",0.2024911,0.735

GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,82,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. I'll start then I'll ask Cameron to join in, of course, as well. So I would say that we've already seen stabilization in April. As we mentioned in the press release and Paul commented on and we've seen kind of continuing improvement by week really throughout April into early May. So I think the answer is, we like the trends that we're seeing in terms of improvement. It's kind of too early to say really what the permanent impact is going to be. But we have seen through the end of April and early May continuing improvement, and that's obviously very good to see. As we also said in our prepared comments, Bryan, in those markets that were a bit ahead of the United States like in Continental Europe, for example, that have reopened earlier than some of the states in the United States, we've seen pretty significant improvement in those markets as well. So while I'd say it's too early to tell what the long-term impact really is, we do like the sequential improvement that we've been experiencing.",0.8765125,0.991

The only thing I would add to that is although our business skews towards SMB sort of globally, it's not really micro merchant. So our average merchant processing volume is pretty healthy. As we've talked about historically, somewhere in that $0.5 billion a year - or excuse me, $0.5 million a year range or above. So if you look at the overall health of the portfolio, I think we'll be generally in a pretty good place overall given the nature of the businesses that we typically serve around the globe size-wise.",0.2051681,0.933

Just to start off, could you help dimension the revenue you expect from the Truist contract and associated timing? And then I'll just ask my follow-up upfront on capital allocation priorities. Jeff, at the time you announced the TSYS acquisition, you focused on the fact that it was all equity because you wanted to keep a strong balance sheet. How are you thinking about deploying capital in this environment when seller expectations are likely coming down?",0.2757287,0.966
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,89,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. David, it's Jeff. I'll start on both those questions. And of course, I'll ask Paul to comment, too. So what I'd say about Truist in terms of timing is we expect that a conversion will happen toward the tail end of 2021, and then we have some kind of a full launch early in 2022. So that's the timing on Truist. We are not going to publicly comment on the revenue or the size of it. But what I would say, as we said in our prepared comments this morning, is it's the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States with 12 million consumer households in many businesses. So obviously, a top six banks in the U.S. is a pretty big deal. Obviously, we have more to say on that as we get further down the path, and it's more appropriate to comment on beyond what we've said today.",0.511032,0.893
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,90,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"As it relates to capital allocation, I think Paul said it well in his prepared remarks, we're 2.45 today times net levered. We generated substantial free cash flow in the month of March, just to pick one recent example. And we did $400 million adjusted, as Paul said, in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our capital position. So I think our TSYS at the time of the merger that you just restated I think is completely accurate. What we're really looking for is really just some stability in the capital markets and the economic environments globally. But our priorities haven't changed.",0.9120996,0.883
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,91,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Our first priority is to reinvest in the business primarily through M&A. And if we don't find attractive opportunities there to return that capital to our shareholders as we, by the way, continue to do in December, January, February up until early March, our pipeline remains very full, to your point. We think this is a great time to be opportunistic. But we do want to make sure that we're continuing to see the benefits of stabilization and return to normalization that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, obviously, before we make any kind of final decisions. Paul, you want to add anything?",1.6846975,0.933
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,92,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. The only thing I would add, David, is the Truist win, obviously, is huge. We talked for several quarters now around the robust pipeline in issuing. And this is just another market test around the superiority of our platform and the success that we've had in winning those kind of pipeline opportunities. And so I think that's point one. The second point on capital allocation. The only thing I would just add is none of the priorities on capital allocation has changed. And so obviously, what we're doing from a dividend standpoint, we are - we have built up a little bit more cash. As I commented in my prepared remarks, but no change on the capital priority standpoint.",0.6971154,0.852
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,93,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I want to add to what Paul said, David, because it's important, it was in our prepared remarks, I want to point it out. So we also think our agreement with Scotiabank was really important, one of the last remaining banks in Canada that was on an in-sourced model basis. We did have other business with Scotiabank in markets like Latin America, but we did not. They did it around - in Canada. I want to point out how important that is and what a great win that was, back to Paul's point, about backlog in issuing for our teams.",0.3298932,0.963

And we spent a lot of time in our prepared remarks talking about the wins at Xenial that we're very proud of this quarter. So I would say, let me just start first with the enterprise QSR business. As we said in our prepared remarks, with the additional Xenial wins, we also had a number of wins with our omni solutions and omni - for better or worse, it's the same name we're using at Xenial that we're using for our omni-channel businesses, which is to say it's online ordering, and we have integrations with all delivery services that you would imagine that we do.",0.2071174,0.967
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,99,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And those businesses, I think I said, were 50% up sequentially. And I'll tell you that in the first quarter, including through March, of course, and by the way, also into April, our Xenial businesses were right on budget. So forget about the virus for a second. Those businesses are really hardware, software, selling technology-based. And unlike what you've seen from some of our competitors that are laying off substantial people in the enterprise QSR level, I just told you that our businesses were on budget at Xenial in the first quarter, and that continued through the month of April.",0.9366548,-0.101
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,100,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So obviously, I think as it relates to where the enterprise business is, it's in an incredibly healthy place, and we're very proud of it.

I think we're seeing the same level of success, Bryan, as you go into the mid-market and to the small end of the restaurant space as well, largely because, again, we compete on the basis of technology, not really competing on the basis of price. And to Jeff's point, our ability to enable our restaurant customers, particularly the mid-market customers and former customers, to move to online order acceptance for delivery and take out quickly on the heels of the pandemic starting to spread here in the U.S. market, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had 1,800 new restaurant customers on our online ordering platform, which in the Heartland channel has the same integrations that Jeff described with the major five delivery services in the U.S. market.",0.4486301,0.955
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,102,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we're actually seeing relatively good performance in our restaurant business overall, particularly if you compare it to the overall trends in the restaurant business in the market. I've seen market data around restaurants, in aggregate, including QSR mid-market and small kind of being down in the 50%, 60% range from a volume standpoint. We're not seeing anything near that as it relates to the health of our restaurant business from a revenue matter. So I think we feel very good about how we're positioned in that space. To Jeff's point, the competitive landscape is shifting throughout this pandemic environment.",0.2742839,0.765
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,103,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And I think when we get to the other side of that, you're going to continue to see us grow our position and grow market share with a very healthy restaurant business.

This is an area, as referred to our remarks, where I really think we're going to pick up incremental share. I think our products are fantastic. As I said last quarter, we invested $50 million, 5-0 million, of capital in Xenial to bring it into production and commercialization. It's there today. We expect to have thousands of locations up and running. We have many day that by the end of this quarter, we really couldn't be more pleased.",0.8288256,0.84
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,105,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And I do think if you look at some of the fintechs or small private companies that raised a lot of capital over the last couple of years in that space, they have already announced massive layoffs and weren't profitable in the first place in a good economic environment, that's kind of what we were referring to in our prepared remarks when we talked about gaining share coming through the crisis.",0.4772242,0.765
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,107,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Well, listen, I think at the end of the day, I think Truist said this at the time of their merger, the scale required for technology investing, whether you're a financial services company or a fintech start or whatever it is, that bar is only going up. So I think the idea of trying to find the best in-market provider for all these things, which we believe and hope and this also validates that we are, I don't think the idea is going away. I think the idea is really gaining steam on the technology side. So I think this is a continuation of the trend. Go back to what I said to David in a minute ago, look at Scotiabank.",0.2355872,0.929
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,108,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So Scotiabank in Canada, as I mentioned, had insourced their business for many years on the consumer and commercial side that was a very significant win for a business. And here is somebody who insource Truist that is already outsourced. But here's somebody who insource who decided to go outsource is probably one of the last remaining large Canadian financial institutions to do that. As Paul said, our pipeline is very full, and it's full in the mix of things kind of globally.",0.1427046,0.733
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,109,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,So I do think you'll see ongoing outsourcing as the scale and technology required to compete effectively when that business goes up. We'll be making more announcements probably in our second quarter call in July and August about the investments we're making in cloud-based technology on - in our issuer business and I think that will just give you a taste as to what the complexity is and what the value is for providing market-leading solutions to the most complicated customers.,0.1064057,0.718

I'll start maybe on the first side, and I'll talk a little bit specifically about merchant. As you know, the sales cycle there is a little bit shorter than obviously in the issuing business. So it's probably the one that's most relevant to the question you're asking. I would say, naturally, as you would expect, with our sales professionals working from home, with a lot of businesses closed or at least operating in a reduced environment during the pandemic, certainly, sales productivity has been impacted.

We are keeping the business momentum going as best we can through this challenging environment. And I'd say we've been delighted with the success we've been able to have. I would say new sales across-the-board is one of the highlights that I would certainly want to focus on for our first quarter performance notwithstanding, obviously, the pandemic impacts. And I think that trend has continued in April, obviously, relative to what reasonable expectations would be in this environment.",0.2842466,0.961
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,118,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I'll add to what Cameron said before I go into the time line special, Ramsey, that just in our general payments business, only 3% to 5% of revenue in a given year is what is sold in that year and recognized in that year. So I think you have to keep it in perspective, most of what we're selling has relatively little economic impact in that year and instead it carries over, obviously, into the following year. As it relates to extended time lines, it just depends on the business. Clearly, the Truist decision, the Scotiabank decision and issuer, those I don't expect to be impacted.",1.1622776,0.66
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,119,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Truist has goals coming out of its merger. And this time line is that competitive takeaway started well before the virus. That time line has not changed in terms of what their goals are. I'd say the same thing on Scotiabank. There are businesses though, of course, as Cameron mentioned, like enterprise QSR, certainly our plans heading into this year, we probably would have sold a lot more hardware, software and equipment this year.",0.3758007,0.772
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,120,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And my guess is a lot of the 26,000 franchisees of our restaurant brands international, just to pick one, my guess is some of those will be deferred as people are just uncertain about the economic environment. And that goes a little bit that obviously dovetails with what Cameron just said about what the new sales impact is. You kind of sold it, but they're going to wait a little bit on CapEx spending just to make sure that the environment is stable.",0.0633452,0.631
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,121,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Conversely, though, you have businesses like our omni product in Xenial and our Xenial point-of-sale product where the demand is high enough for online ordering where that's zooming ahead, which is why Cameron said, well in excess of what we assume. So undoubtedly, there'll be some impact, but it's really a tale of the vertical market and the geography that you're talking about.",0.0676157,0.262
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,123,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"No. Ramsey, it's Cameron. I'll touch on that. I'll ask Paul to jump in if he adds anything to add as well. I would say, by and large, the revenue synergy expectations we had in the 2020 budget weren't that significant to begin with. I would say the tactical synergies that we are working to execute against in the near term, things like selling Vital through the Heartland channel, cross-selling payroll into the legacy TSYS business, cross-selling our analytics and customer engagement platform into the legacy TSYS business, all of those initiatives remain very much on track.",0.1821295,0.813
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,124,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we did roll out Vital into the Heartland channel in the first quarter, just as we said we would do. We're bringing it to Canada on an earlier timeframe than we had originally anticipated. Now the second quarter versus the third quarter, a lot of the investments we continue to make in the business, notwithstanding the pandemic environment are really geared towards ensuring that we can cross-sell and deliver products across the distribution channels we operate, both in the U.S. market as well as internationally as well, which will yield future revenue synergies that are part of the plan.",0.013076,0.826
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,125,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And then I would say the discussions that really, we believe, will be important to achieving the longer-term expectations, $125 million over the three-year time frame, all of those continue. The transaction optimization initiatives that we have and are pursuing with a number of our large partners outside of the U.S., those continue to progress notwithstanding the environment we're operating in. Opportunities to cross-sell our issuing platform into our existing acquiring customer and partner base outside of the U.S. and vice versa, those conversations continue to persist as well.",0.371731,0.881
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,126,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So I think sitting here today, the conclusion is we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve at least $125 million of revenue synergies within the three-year time frame we set out when we announced the merger last year. And I would say, importantly, we gain confidence every single day in - as it relates to the momentum we can build by collaborating and leveraging the broad base of products and capabilities that we have by virtue of the merger.",1.3564757,0.949
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,131,Question,2020-05-06,1,2020,Darrin Peller,Lehman Brothers,"Hey, thanks. Glad to hear you're doing okay. Look, I mean I guess when we think about looking through the second quarter and 2020, to some degree, even now, given a lot of folks are doing that, I think. You do sound like structurally, you're going to potentially come out on the other side of this stronger given the wins you're having in the omni-channel capabilities. Can you, Jeff and Cameron, maybe just revisit the types of revenue you have that you think are resilient in what we would call a normal recessionary environment? Not today, but what type of revenue do you think you have that actually is more - what percentage is either software-centric or defensive in some ways just because I think it's very different in a normal - even a tough downturn than today. And how - like how would you think you guys would perform on revenues versus that environment, let's say, versus what you would have thought pre-COVID-19?",0.1329923,0.889
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,132,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Darrin, I'll start. I may have said this when we were together last time in terms of what a normal environment would look like. Obviously, we're not in a normal environment today. So let's just start with our software businesses. And by that, I really want to start with issuer first. So our issuer business, I think what we said and Paul can obviously provide additional color here, but if you go back to the last recession and if you - in 2008 and 2009, and if you exclude those financial institutions that went out of business, so they don't - didn't exist thereafter, our issuer business grew through the last recessionary environment.",0.0921708,-0.486
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,133,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So if our long-term target is mid-single digits, let's just call it 5%, to pick a round number, I would say 2% to 3% growth. So kind of call it 2.5% is what I would expect from issuer growth in a normal recessionary environment, which is what Paul saw, I believe, in 2008 and 2009. Business and Consumer, we really haven't had either company, TSYS or Global, going back to the recession. I do understand that Netspend did grow substantially through the last recession. But as you know, that market and that environment, obviously, today has changed. And in fact, as we said in our prepared comments, that business is doing very well in April, as you would imagine, with $1.2 billion of stimulus funds being used on groceries and pharmacies and essentials being used in April.",0.1960854,0.493
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,134,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"That is going - that produced a very big number for that business label, right? So obviously, it's not a normal environment is the plan we're trying to make for that business. So it's kind of harder to say on Netspend. So between issuer and Netspend, you're talking about 35% of the revenue of the company. Now let's pivot to merchant, which is two-thirds of the revenue of the business. Let's start with our own software businesses, call it, by and large, about $800 million, $900 million of revenue or kind of thereabouts or about 10% of the company. I would say in a normal environment, those are pretty resilient. We have differences today. What are the differences? The difference today is that K-12 schools, a fantastic business for us.",0.0088968,0.829
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,135,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Software and payments, obviously, K-12 schools have been closed. So we haven't had K-12 schools open for quite some time. Two-thirds of our revenue in our education, that K-12 is payment-based, the other third is pure software sales in that business. So obviously, this is a different ball of wax, to your point, than we're used to. But in a normal recessionary environment, if that's a term you want to use, that business is pretty well inflated.",0.2259786,0.681
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,136,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And of course, we all expect our kids to be back at school in August and for that to recover. Obviously, Cameron commented in our AMD business, very healthy today. I think he gave you numbers on that. Our university business, online or off-line, very healthy today. So I'd say in a normal recessionary environment, the $800 million to $900 million of own software revenue is very resilient. We already gave you commentary on - enterprise QSR is actually already hitting its sales today, right? And those are hardware and software sales.",0.0245552,0.717
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,137,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And then in our integrated business, it just depends on the vertical market. That's the other piece of the business, call that 20%, plus or minus, 15%, 20% of revenue of the company. In an ordinary recession, going back to your question, people go to the dentist. They go to the chiropractor, they go to their health professional. They go to nail salons. They go to self-storage. So in a normal recessionary environment, that's pretty protected as well. So when you bring that all together, I think what I said in our and at your conference is our normal model, call it, ballpark 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, plus or minus, because we say 9%, 11%, that probably adds up to call it 5% or whatever the math is in a normal recessionary environment.",0.0679715,0.791
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,138,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Obviously, that's not the environment we're in with K-12 schools closed and everything else that we've been describing on the call. But I would say ordinarily, we're well into the mid-single digits in revenue, even in normal recessionary environment with the pieces I just gave you and well into the teams, if you compare it to our kind of typical 16% to 18% guide and earnings ex mergers, obviously, we're doing better than that. As Paul articulated, we just produced 19% constant currency, obviously, with the virus for the first quarter. But in a normal environment, you're well into teens on earnings as well. And that's kind of what a normal recession looks like. And I think it's similar to what I said in your conference last month.",0.1875445,0.84
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,139,Question,2020-05-06,1,2020,Darrin Peller,Lehman Brothers,"Yes. I think it's helpful to revisit that. Just one quick follow-up we're getting from clients is just when we think about April, I know you guys said it's slightly better or it's shown an inflection, obviously, and some improvements. I mean, is there any data points you can give us in terms of second half March specific growth rates versus, let's call it, the last week of April growth rates in each of the key segments of your business? And then we'll just leave it there. Thanks, guys.",0.8574169,0.946
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,140,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Absolutely. Darrin, it's Cameron. I'll jump in on that, and I'll ask Paul maybe to provide a little bit more color around some of the specifics. Maybe I'll start in jumping off from Jeff's earlier commentary. If you look at our issuer business and our consumer business, which is about third of our overall business, I think we've generally seen those businesses roughly around flat to maybe down slightly in the current environment. Our issuer business is largely bundled pricing. We obviously do have some revenues that are exposed to transaction volumes. But by and large, that business is a pretty resilient business. And I think we saw that play out largely over the course of late March and the month of April as well.",0.2001868,0.844
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,141,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Same thing on the business and consumer segment. We're seeing that business benefit from the stimulus spending. It is a debit-oriented business. Debit skews towards consumer non-discretionary. Obviously, that provides benefits for our business and consumer segment. So again, when you put that together with issuer, the combined 35% of the company coming out of those two segments, really, by and large, is going to be around sort of flattish, which I think is a very, very good sign for the overall health of the business and I think it speaks to the resiliency of the overall model we have.",0.1783935,0.843
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,142,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Now pivoting over to the merchant business, and I was pleased to see that Visa and Mastercard was able to put out some market data last week because I think that provides a very good barometer for how the market is trending, and I think it creates a good backdrop for how we're thinking about our own business performance. I would say our own data is trending very similarly to what you're seeing coming out of the networks if we look globally across all of our merchant businesses.",0.0865504,0.886
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,143,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"More specifically, as you talk about North America, which is about 80% of our business today, I think our business overall as a revenue matter, is trending reasonably well relative to the metrics provided by Visa, in particular, around the credit trends. And I think those credit trends probably are a pretty good proxy for our overall North American business as a performance matter for the month of April.",0.107721,0.912
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,144,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And here's really why. I think credit is probably a better metric for us than the combined or the debit trends they're providing. Our business in North America skews towards more credit than debit, where we do have debit, it tends to be more in the petroleum space, and that's obviously been impacted by a variety of different factors, not just the pandemic over the first quarter.",0.4561021,0.824
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,145,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"We do have good debit exposure, obviously, in the consumer business, as we talked about previously, which is a nice offset to that. But in merchant specific, we tend to skew towards more credit than we do debit to begin with. I would say secondly, our business does differ from the market. Visa and Mastercard represent the market. Obviously, we're more vertically focused.",0.2356787,0.888
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,146,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we're not in travel. We're not in a lot of delayed delivery elements of the market that have been more heavily impacted. But the flip side to that is we're not in large supermarkets. We're not in pharmacy, large pharmacy chains, to a large degree. We're not in Walmart or Target, those types of large retail environments. So we haven't seen some of the positive trends on that side, but we certainly haven't seen more the disaster as negative trends in travel as well.",0.3172478,-0.759
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,147,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"The other thing I would say about our business, and I mentioned this earlier, is we're skewed more towards SMB. And those have been slightly more impacted, I'd say, in this environment, some of the larger retailers as you think about our portfolio. But I would say that is more than offset by the fact that, as Jeff highlighted, we have vertical market businesses that have been very resilient.",0.0351806,0.0
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,148,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Certainly, health care, higher education, our enterprise QSR business have performed really well in this environment. That has served to offset some of the more SMB skewing that we have in the portfolio overall. So a bit of a long-winded answer, but I hope it gives you a sense of some of the color that we're seeing in the North American market. I think when you blend all that together, it's trending reasonably well. And the Visa credit, that is a good proxy for the performance we've seen in the North America business.",0.4504981,0.956
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,149,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Not surprisingly outside of North America consistent with what you saw from Mastercard in particular, I would say volumes are trending a little bit worse than what we're seeing in North America. In Europe, the UK and Spanish markets have been in lockdown remain largely in lockdown now. Asia is a bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, we've been dealing with it for a more prolonged period of time. Some markets are starting to reopen, some remain closed. But I think if you look at all that together, it's a little bit worse than North America, and I think that's consistent with what you saw coming out of Visa and Mastercard.",0.0289539,-0.534
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,150,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So hopefully, that gives you a sense as to what we're seeing in April overall. I think the business is holding up really well, all things considered, particularly when compared to the market data that we're seeing coming out of the networks.",1.4987547,0.658
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,151,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. And the only thing I would add on to that is, if you look at it from a margin standpoint, the cost actions that we took, we were on the front foot of this to move quickly as it relates to the cost actions. And if you even look at first quarter, the majority of the margin expansion came from our Issuer Solutions business, which also has a defensive aspect to it from a revenue standpoint. So as we go throughout the quarters, throughout the rest of this year, you'll see margin expansion in issuer, you'll see margin expansion in business and consumer. And we're going to continue to kind of manage the margin, as Jeff said earlier around the dynamics of the recovery, but we've already laid out a very aggressive and implemented plan around margin expansion that positions us well for this environment.",0.0392012,0.479
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,154,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes. Tim, it's Jeff. I'll take a crack at that. So first of all, we're delighted with our relationship with Citi. The U.S. and UK bins are live, those transactions are being piloted now and we're very pleased with where we are. But if you take a step back for a second, we tried saying this in our prepared remarks, we've had a really good run in the first quarter and into April on e-comm omni. So the first thing I think I said in the prepared remarks is that was one of our best-performing business and up absolutely, I think, mid-single digits for the first quarter globally of 2020. That trend has continued into April. So worldwide ex T&E, and as Cameron said, only 2%, 3% of our company revenue-wise worldwide anywhere is in T&E. So we're not really exposed there. But ex T&E, our e-comm omni business in April were up double digits, right around 10% for the month of April.",0.1053381,0.94
GPN-2020-Q1-2020-05-06,155,Answer,2020-05-06,1,2020,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So I think - and we gave a list in our prepared remarks, Cameron and I both did, of the wins that we've had in that business. So we're really fortunate to be in the position we're in. I think it's showing in the first quarter, it's showing in April. But importantly, I think as Visa and Mastercard called out and we did as well, I just think the virus and everything else is going to continue to shift toward further digitization of payments, further migration online. We gave a bunch of examples, Cameron and I did, in our prepared remarks about what's going on with online ordering, digital wallets the rest. And while we're not in the delivery business, we are integrated to all the delivery services. So I think you're asking the right question. Those businesses have performed best for us in the first quarter and continue to perform that way worldwide into April.",0.0626335,0.956

So for the full year, I was talking about it from the fourth quarter for the full year the 130 probably then the 140, 150 something in that ballpark absent the FX headwinds we saw in the back half of the year and a little bit pressure from the recent M&A that we've executed.",0.1587796,-0.057

We continue to invest heavily in the business particularly in our technology environments, in our products and innovation to drive a differentiated model. And I think we've seen over the course of time that that has proved to be a very wise thing to do as we continue to widen them out, we believe as it relates to our business versus competitors in the space. As it relates to 2019 in particular, I think, you have a couple of things, we're always balancing obviously reinvestment back into the business with what we want to flow through to the bottom line.",1.1485056,0.886
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,65,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Secondly if you recall in 2018, we had a little bit of a tailwind from the adoption of ASC 606, that obviously anniversaried at the end of 2018. So a little bit of benefit you saw in margin in 2018 from that don't exist in 2019. So 2019 is a pretty pure year to look at relative to our cycle guidance, which is up to 75 basis points annually. We're getting a little bit of pressure from the acquisition as we talked about previously, but again absent that, absent FX, we would have been north of 100 which is the relative comparison against the 75 basis point targets. So we feel really good about the balance I think we're striking in 2019, as it relates to reinvestment in the business, as well as obviously continuing to drive strong bottom line growth.",1.0828144,0.955

If you look at the number of ISV partnerships we have in United States just Global Payments, those probably exceed the entire deals of most of the individual markets that we look at.

So, I do think what you'll see at Global Payments in '19 and beyond is a lot of progress on things like our restaurant and food service strategy. So, one of the things we said in our prepared remarks is that the combined Xenial-SICOM business is already in 60 plus countries with restaurants, so, it's already been nativized restaurants or going to sell in all those markets. We have a lot of restaurants in Europe and a lot of restaurants in Asia and a lot of restaurants in Canada and also tuned to come in Mexico.

GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,71,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So yes, we'll see continued progress in those markets.

If you recall part of the thesis around owning our owned software from an integrated payment standpoint is controlling our own destiny with respect to internationalizing those solutions. So when we own the software we don't have to rely on a partner obviously in terms of what we want to bring to markets outside of the US, how we want to bring them, and when we want to bring them. So I think as it relates to the vertical markets again, where we own our owned software outright today, we are really driving kind of the growth and expansion of integrated payments in these markets by bringing our own solutions, and obviously utilizing the distribution capabilities we have in those markets obviously to drive incremental growth and to drive again an incremental and differentiated solutions relative to competitors in those local - foreign markets.",0.2148194,0.906

So I guess like a little bit of color, because that's the - I mean the numbers speak for themselves and overtime and I appreciate Jeff the color you gave on each of the businesses upfront, but if you could give a little more color on that, I think it would be helpful.",0.4289575,0.929
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,75,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Sure Bob, its Jeff and I'll start. So as we said in our prepared remarks, we managed all of our businesses, but in particular our software technology businesses along a core and an edge strategy, which means those things that are customer facing, that are specific to the markets, so for example in the case of healthcare in AdvancedMD, those elements of the software that are specific to the healthcare market are really managed at the edge or locally by the folks over at AdvancedMD. What do we apply to their management? We apply our own views on security, compliance, regulatory, we apply our own views on architecture of those distribution chains, and we rely on our oversight coupled with local management to be retained and grown overtime to run those businesses effectively for us.",0.8501779,0.848
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,76,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"The best indicator of how we're doing along those lines is the track record that you referenced that we've been able to produce certainly going back with this management team to 2012 with APT. So the people running APT today are the people who were running APT and PayPros in 2012 and 2014, AdvancedMD is more recent, the people running AdvancedMD today are the people who were running it in August and September of 2018, when we did the deal in the first place.",0.5633452,0.765
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,77,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We also then apply our own view of core functionality, which is to say in the case of AdvancedMD, for example, their integration with the payments infrastructure and architecture that they already have, we said at the time of the deal that's about 20% penetrated and we'd like to increase that to a much higher percentage, I gave you statistics in my prepared comments about where that sits today. So expanding and monetizing that payment space is a core functionality that we bring. And then of course, we also lay on our own sales capabilities. I also referenced this in my prepared remarks, that our ability to generate more sales, more physician sales through Heartland, for example, our ability to generate more payroll referrals, which I also referenced, and our ability of course to sell more payments via OpenEdge in the case of AdvancedMD are things that we're all focused on.",0.2733096,0.934
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,78,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And to be honest, when you put it together and you look at our guidance for 2019 building on the success for '18, but for these purposes its '19, one of the ways that we get to double-digit organic revenue growth guidance in the United States in our direct businesses is because of those effective cross-sells that I just described.

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Bob, it's Cameron, I'll just add one point to that which is, I wouldn't underestimate the importance of our priced M&A as it relates to the success we've had with the transactions we consummated of the course of time. We spent a tremendous amount of time obviously vetting these businesses upfront strategically, culturally, and in particular certainly as it relates to the returns that we expect to be able to generate from them. But as it relates to the cultural point, that's one of the key elements that we address going in to a transaction. How that management is going to be able to adapt to the Global Payments, are they going to be affected in the environment in which we operate, are they going to be able to obviously keep up with the cadence of the business that we run today, and are they well positioned to obviously understand what we're trying to achieve as a company, as it relates to both on strategy and the expectation we've set with the investment community, and I think we've got tremendous success with that to date with really every one of the acquisitions that we've executed over the course of the last several years.",0.4265255,0.891
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,80,Question,2019-02-13,4,2018,Robert Napoli,Piper Jaffray,"And just a follow-up, are you seeing a continued, significant amount of opportunities to acquire in new verticals, as you try to avoid competing with your partnership business?",0.2972973,0.296
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,81,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Bob, its Jeff, I would say the answer is absolutely yes to what you said. So our pipeline we're being told that's not just a vertical markets commentary, that's a commentary that new geographies and other businesses as well more broadly for our FI and other related businesses. So the answer is yes, the pipeline is whole. Some of our markets like restaurants are changing very rapidly, and of course we've made significant investments in the form of SICOM in 2018 to accelerate our rates of growth in those businesses. So we're not applying these skillsets against the static pool, rather these markets are changing all the time. But no there's no limit on the pipeline potential that we're seeing. Now having said that though, we just got a number of acquisitions in the back half of '18 which is close to our joint venture with HSBC in Mexico a couple of weeks ago. So obviously we're very focused on executing and integrating those businesses to deliver on that commitment that we're making.",0.2704626,0.937

GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,84,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Well Tien, this is Jeff. I put in full effort, I can't speak for Cameron. In the scheme of things, listen I think at the end of the day, and of course I'm joking on that because Cameron is sitting opposite to me. But at the end of the day listen, I think it goes back to what Cameron said, we're looking at partnerships and AdvancedMD is a very good example of them. We're really focused on, does it fit our strategy, what's the culture of the business that we're partnering with, and what are the financial outcomes that we're trying to solve?",0.1711744,0.891
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,85,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So it's been great growth at AdvancedMD. Is that growth in excess of what we hoped would happen? Of course not. At the end of the day we have an opinion as to what we think we can do with that business, and this is just not an accident. We spent a lot of time cross-selling, monetizing, and managing those relationships, which we think is critically important to what we do. So, no I think, we are very pleased with where we are, but those things are really related by design. Now can that accelerate further? Well we certainly hope with the cross-selling and the globalization opportunities we have, restaurants in particular, some of the vertical markets that we're in that we can continue to accelerate growth. But I think it's important for us to give you increasing evidence of how we're doing to show you how pleased we are with the investments that we have made on behalf of our shareholders.",1.0572954,0.984

I mean I asked that I know you're kidding, but I know it takes time to get the sales on board with such a new vertical, so that is why I was curious about the sustainability. So my follow-up just on SICOM and Xenial going well, you mentioned a large signing there. I'm curious in the aggregate the pricing on these deals both on the product side as well as on the payment side or spread, any surprise there as you go to market especially moving maybe up the market a little bit?",0.3458691,0.909
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,87,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"No Tien, it's Jeff. We haven't had any surprises there, we're really pleased as I said in my prepared remarks about SICOM. Restaurants is one of our biggest vertical markets, and of course we've also added food service management, which is a larger market that we weren't in directly at Global before as part of the partnership. If you step back for a second, what we really like about the SICOM partnership is that the old Global are really through Heartland and Xenial had 25,000 QSRs before the deal and we doubled that with 50.",0.5370107,0.764
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,88,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"But if you step back for a second, the bread and butter at Xenial was really the enterprise level of QSR Tien-tsin, and that's exactly what SICOM does. So it's a very nice product overlap in that legacy Global and Heartland really at front of the house solutions. SICOM brought with it not just front of the house which is where some of the overlaps are, but middle of the house and back of house for enterprise customers, as well as the globalization of those businesses. So no we're not surprised by any of the trends, we are already in that business. I think it gives us additional scale in one of the most attractive vertical markets that we're in [Global]. (inaudible) what our bank partners outside the United States want to talk about, and the restaurant market as I said before is very rapidly changing today, and it's very nice to work on the forefront of that with leading technologies to do that globally.",0.0362989,0.932
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,89,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"So we gave an indication in my prepared remarks of our recent win I would say more to come that business has a lot of momentum and this is a business to go back to (inaudible) of the prior questions where software is the leading strategy. So forget about Global Payments for a second, many of our competitors in that business are also leading with technology and leading with software, and I think that really is, as I said in response to David's first question, a validation honestly of the approach that we are taking in our technology-enablement.",0.2825623,0.758
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,90,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And the only thing that I would add to that Tien-tsin is, I think what we've seen in SICOM thus far is consistent with what we've seen in (inaudible) historically more (inaudible) pieces around leading with software, and obviously utilizing software as a means by which to drive incremental value from customers and drag payments has proven to be a very effective and economically opportunity for us. So I think thus far the ability to bring solutions that SICOM brings to their front of the house, middle of the house, back of the house, again the middle of the house and back of the house being very distinctive relative to anyone else in the space, the ability to use that software platform again to drive the payment volume as well again has proven to be a very valuable strategy and a very effective strategy from an economic standpoint.",0.5644458,0.963

So I would say our pipeline is pretty full inside but also outside the United States about FI partnerships. So if you think about what we're looking for, we certainly see more opportunities in Asia in that area, more opportunities in Latin America in that area sitting here today. I think what is interesting if anything else is the tone of those conversations So the tone of those conversations today has moved from compliance which is where it was a number of years ago, meaning EMV and that type of thing and investments in those types of security assets into how do you help me grow my business by of vertical market.",0.452669,0.982

I think Jeff mentioned obviously in his prepared remarks, we just closed a joint venture with HSBC in Mexico. So we're busy working to expand in to that market as well. In addition to what Jeff said, the other interesting thing I think in the pipeline for us is obviously a fair number of new FI opportunity - partnership opportunities around the globe, but also more and more conversations with existing partners about expanding into new markets, in particularly with Erste in Central Europe, looking at opportunities to expand further with them, given the success we've been able to have already in markets and working in collaboration with them.",0.2260274,0.961

So I would say our relationship with Vista remains very strong, and we've had great success already in mining opportunities in their existing portfolio of companies that have now become payment partners of ours over the course of the last call it 18 months, since we really established this relationship with Vista.

Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As it relates to them selling their stake in Global Payments that they acquired by virtue of the ACTIVE acquisition, I would start by saying they are a financial buyer and a financial enterprise and ultimately I think they looked at being able to realize a very good return on that investment as it relates to the Global Payments stock, and as around in the market fundraising and looking to clean up prior funds and it's a very logical thing for them to do.

I would just add that we've a lot of respect for Vista, I think they've done a fantastic job. But that is just one of a number of private equity and financial firms with whom we have a relationship and an ongoing dialogue. So I think the most interesting thing is we've differentiated sales proposition going into that line of business, we approach private equity firms as a whole, rather than each one of their individual companies, and we see kind of more warm leads as we do with Vista with those companies. I think in that we are distinctive, I know we are distinctive relative to our peers.

So that means not just partner on software, but owned software, partnered software, e-comm and omni assets and faster-growth markets. So sometimes we gets lost in this, also we talked a lot about what kind of owned software particularly in vertical markets like restaurants where it's kind of a hot topic.

So our point of view there is, the proof's in the pudding and the results are what they are to sign up the largest chain of chiropractors, one of the largest municipal and I think big government billing facilities, and one of the largest not-for-profit ISV providers.

So if you go back to when we got into it, in 2012 in our business more generally, but for these purposes in OpenEdge it's always the case that as renewals come up and new customers are competitive that we need to continue to evolve that business we're offering more and more value and we're providing more and more scale in what we do. But to answer your question, there's not been a sea change in the way to go to market in that business competitively or by way of pricing over the last year or so. Our business has always been competitive, since we got into it in 2012, it's not like Mercury was not a good competitor back in '12, it's not like the assets that First Data bought over the last year or two (inaudible), it's probably they weren't good competitors in their own rights.",0.4330961,-0.605
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,108,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I think what is different about us, as we said in our prepared comment is our ability to offer a single technology solution and provide more value-add for our partners which is part of the wins that we had in the three that I mentioned. The other thing that is distinctive is the ability to globalize and take these into a multinational geographies, which I think we're either unique or one of two really doing today. So there really hasn't been a sea change for us in the way the economics work in those businesses. I think we talked about the great performance we had in the fourth quarter at OpenEdge, and I think the recent wins that we highlighted by name I think proved that.",0.0580071,0.96
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,109,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And just to put a little finer point on that Chris, from my perspective, if you look at the backdrop of obviously a lot of discussion and more competition in the integrated space, OpenEdge had its best year in terms of new partner signings in 2018, ended the year again with mid-teens growth for the fourth quarter, which obviously positions it well heading into 2019. The last thing I would say is, if you look at our guide for the US Direct business in 2019, again we're guiding to double digit organic growth in our US Direct business. We wouldn't do that or couldn't do that to the extent our partnership business was not performing at the level that it's performing today and not helping to drive the overall rate of revenue growth for that US Direct business.",0.0672478,0.905
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,110,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So that's a signal I think to a (inaudible) degree to the amount of confidence we have with the durability of the partnership model, and obviously I think one of the strengths that we have and again what we've differentiated is the optionality we have to own a partner depending on the vertical and depending on the fit. So I think that again positions us extraordinarily well kind of heading into 2019 and for years to come, as we continue to execute on that strategy.",0.3907223,0.863
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,112,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Chris, it's Cameron, so I'll touch on that one. I would say we've had fantastic performance in Europe above our own cycle guidance frankly for that region, and that's really been driven by our Spanish business strength in our Central European business and strength in our e-comm and omni-channel business across Continental Europe. So I think we're delighted with what we've been able to achieve. Now if you think back to 2018, we had good growth in our UK domestic business for the better part of the year, and obviously that was something that was helpful to the overall European results for the year.",0.1715442,0.974
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,113,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As we look to 2019, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're guiding the UK in the kind of mid-single digit rate of growth, and consequently overall Europe to a high-single digit rate of growth for the year. We think that's a prudent approach to take getting into the year, particularly with Brexit on the forefront of everyone's mind. I would say our guide assumed effectively a muddle (inaudible) for lack of a better term kind of outcome as it relates to Brexit, so we are not assuming that the economy in the UK is going to fall off the cliff. I'd say we're affectively assuming something like what you saw in Q4, which was very, very low GDP growth if any, I think it was 0.2% for Q4.",0.3433998,0.901
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,114,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"That's kind of the outlook that we're expecting in the UK for the rest of 2019. Obviously it remains to be seen how Brexit will play out and we'll adapt accordingly, but that's what our assumptions reflect today as it relates to the UK. I think the rest of Europe, we continue to assume a macro environment fairly similar to what we saw in 2018, there's a little bit of softness in a few spots in Europe, but the markets that we're in, in particular, Spain, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and again the strength driven by our e-comm and omni business in that market, I think give us a lot of confidence we are still going to be able to grow Europe notwithstanding the UK at that high-single digit rate for 2019.",0.2095268,0.887
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,116,Question,2019-02-13,4,2018,Bryan Keane,Prudential,"Wanted to ask, a lot of payment players saw a slowdown in volume in fourth quarter, and in particular, saw weakness in cross-border, doesn't feel like you guys saw some of that same weakness, maybe the model is a little bit different with mix. Can you just give us a little bit of help when thinking about that?",0.4361702,-0.169
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,117,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Bryan, It's Cameron. I'll jump in and ask Jeff to add any color that he may like as well. I would just say as your opening comment, I would say across the board, we generally saw volumes pretty consistent in Q4, with what we saw in Q3. Obviously the UK was a little slower than what we saw in Q3 and that's a function of the GDP environment, and I think that's pretty obvious to anyone who's paying attention to what's happening in the UK and then obviously the GDP results coming out of the UK.",0.140411,0.875
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,118,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Putting that aside, I would say in the rest of the markets around the globe, I would say volumes held up very well, and I think again that's to your own point somewhat a function of our own strategy on how we go to market, the diversity of distribution that we have today, and obviously our ability to lead the technology in most of those distribution channels. As it relates to cross-border volume, in particular, we really didn't see the slowdown obviously that was reported by the networks and then some other players in the market, as well on a cross-border basis.",0.5993151,0.726
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,119,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"If you look at our European e-comm and omni business, which is really the heart of where we see the majority of our cross-border volumes, we continue to see mid-teens growth in that business in the fourth quarter and volume trends that were relatively consistent, I would say, with what we saw throughout the course of 2018. So no real meaningful slowdown in our portfolio of businesses Bryan, but it's obviously something we continue to monitor closely heading into 2019. But I think we have a lot of confidence that's evidenced again by the guide that we provided for 2019 as to how those businesses are going to hold up.",0.0716065,0.742
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,120,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Bryan, it's Jeff. I think Cameron is right, and also I think it speaks to the distinctiveness of our models are focused on SMBs domestically including in Europe and those markets and selectively focused on, first of all, MNCs where we think we can add value-added solutions and differences, and not just based on price indeed in those markets, those faster-growth markets where we think it's most attractive to offer e-comm and omni. So unlike the card networks, we are not the entirety of the market, in every market that we are in unlike some of our other competitors we have deliberately targeted some of the markets that Cameron and I described, because we think they are more attractive, and we think they are more resilient. So time will tell, but I think you can see the results in our fourth quarter and what our guidance reflects",0.1725979,0.731
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,121,Question,2019-02-13,4,2018,Bryan Keane,Prudential,"And just a quick follow-up Cameron, can you help us with the impact of the HSBC JV in Mexico, and how fast do you guys think it will take for you guys to start gaining share in that market?",0.0762411,0.772
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,122,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Bryan, it's Cameron. So, if you recall in my prepared remarks, I gave an estimate for sort of net interest expense that's obviously net of other income as well, where you'll see the impact of the HSBC Mexico joint venture for 2018. So, as we said when we announced that joint venture, we think it certainly in the near term are more important strategically than it perhaps is financially. Now over the course of time, as we scale that business, we expect it to be a nice contributor obviously of income to the company through our 50% ownership in the joint venture. I would not expect that to be a material amount in 2019, given the fact that we're just getting the joint venture off the ground, and obviously it's going to take a little bit of time to scale.",0.4019303,0.9
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,123,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As it relates to our ability to gain share, part of what we like about that market and obviously working with our partner HSBC is, they have a far greater percentage of the commercial banking market today in Mexico than they do in the merchant acquired market. So there's a lot of room, I think in that portfolio to capture share just with the existing book of business that HSBC Mexico is supporting today from a commercial banking standpoint, before you even get into taking share from other competitors who may not be HSBC commercial banking customers today.",0.6970735,0.953
GPN-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,124,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So I think we have a lot of confidence in the ability to grow that business. I would say our forecast for growth in that business is robust, obviously we'll take a little bit of time to just get it off the ground and to start to scale the business effectively. So more to come on that typically as we head into 2020 and '21, but for '19 it's not going to be a material impact to our overall financial results.",0.2216687,0.739

We delivered record fourth quarter and full year 2021 results that exceeded our expectations, highlighting the resilience of our business model. We achieved record transactions across the business in the fourth quarter, including a new peak during the holidays despite the incremental impact of COVID-19 variants.

GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,7,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We accomplished a great deal over the course of 2021 as we continued to advance our differentiated strategies for growth. This includes our partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide, the expansion of our collaboration with AWS, our preferred issuer technology solutions partner for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies; our successful acquisitions of Zego and MineralTree to advance our software leadership position with unmatched worldwide payments expertise; a strategic alliance with Virgin Money and our first use case post-merger combining issuing and acquiring capabilities; and our partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium to enable its multi-channel commerce ecosystem.",1.2049822,0.949
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,8,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"And we are carrying that momentum into 2022 as we successfully executed on our goal to redefine the future of digital commerce, extending our lead, continuing to gain share and deepening our competitive moat. Specifically, we are delighted to announce that we have been chosen by CaixaBank as the finalist company in their selection process for a technology partner for its European card issuing business comprising nearly 30 million cards. We expect to finalize contract negotiations over the coming weeks. Caixa is the largest domestic bank in Spain, serving tens of millions of households and a full range of business clients across multiple countries in Europe. This latest achievement is yet another example of the enhanced revenue opportunities derived from our merger with TSYS just over 2 years ago.",1.1096085,0.937
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,9,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"When this goes live, as anticipated in the back half of next year, we expect this initiative to be among the first legacy direct-to-cloud transformations in card issuing technologies among major financial institutions and it will be the first entry of TSYS into the highly attractive Iberian marketplace. Together with our recently announced partnership with Virgin Money, we believe Global Payments will then become a leading debit technology provider across Europe. We are also excited to announce that we are embarking on a multiyear partnership with Mastercard to modernize and accelerate card payments in the cloud across authorization, clearing and settlement. We are on this journey to drive ecosystem change and to help our clients bring differentiated value to the market. This is yet another example of how we are progressing the payments landscape with leading technology partners and bringing the next generation of modernized AWS cloud-enabled payments to customers.",1.4046263,0.866

It's worth highlighting that our issuer business signed multiyear contract extensions with several of our largest customers over the last 12 months, including Citi, CIBC, Barclays and Banco Carrefour. And our strategy of aligning with market share winners was also successful in 2021. Recent examples include Barclays' purchase of the Gap card portfolio as well as Capital One's purchase at BJ's Wholesale Club card base. We have 34 active prospects in the pipeline with AWS, 11 of which are fin-techs, neobanks and startups.",1.0266904,0.968

We also reached an agreement for our first legacy Global Payments issuer customer, KB Bank in the Czech Republic to move to our TSYS Prime platform in the fourth quarter, another revenue synergy from our merger. Finally, of the 9 LOIs we have in our Issuer Solutions business today, 5 are competitive takeaways. In addition, we recently had another new customer win move from LOI into production that was also a competitive takeaway. We have been successful in expanding our target addressable markets in 2021 beyond AWS as we diversify and broaden our distribution.",0.9124555,0.961

We will provide B2B virtual commercial account services to banks and fintechs with Xtend serving our infant virtual card issuance product. Through relationships like ecolytiq and Xtend, we were able to support a full spectrum of solutions across emerging use cases. And while we have been providing market-leading technologies for buy now, pay later, or BNPL, initiatives for decades, we continue to innovate and deliver installment payments products as BNPL demand grows. This includes expanding our combined installment solutions with Visa and signing a global referral agreement with Mastercard. And through our partnership with leading technology companies, private label branded retailers and many of the world's largest issuers we will be able to provide our customers with a complete ecosystem of BNPL capabilities on a regulated, compliant and responsible basis.

GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,14,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Turning to our merchant business, we are pleased to report the release of the first phase of our Google Run and Grow My Business product that integrates Google's solutions with our innovative capabilities in our digital portal environment during the fourth quarter as planned. We continue to expect to launch the next phase to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services, including online ordering, retail inventory and reservations to our digital platform later this year. Google is also now a live merchant customer in Asia-Pacific and we expect to launch Google as a merchant customer in North America by the end of this quarter. We continue to deliver a full suite of vertically fluent solutions across dozens of markets worldwide. For example, our enterprise QSR business delivered bookings growth for its cloud POS services in excess of 50% in 2021 and went live with new marquee customers like Denny's, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants.",1.5085409,0.933

We delivered more than 300 million omnichannel restaurant experiences in 2021, up 50% versus 2020 and indicative of share shift due to the pandemic and market share gains. By way of comparison, we enabled 19 million omnichannel orders in 2019 prior to COVID-19. Our AMD business generated revenue growth of over 30% in 2021 and in excess of 35% for the fourth quarter compared to 2019. And that momentum is poised to continue with bookings growth of 40% in the fourth quarter and 26% and for the full year over 2020.",1.7879004,0.951
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,16,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I am particularly proud that AMD's telemedicine solution enabled 2.5 million provider visits over the last year, marking an 85% increase from 2020. And to put it in perspective, that is up from the roughly 100,000 telemedicine visits facilitated annually prior to the pandemic. We are also delighted to have hit the ground running in one of the largest and most attractive verticals in 2021 in real estate. Zego delivered near 20% bookings growth for the full year, enabled by its continued success with existing enterprise customers like ACC and Thalhimer and by expanding with new partners like Managed America and Equity LifeStyles, one of its largest new customers to date. Zego's payments penetration into its base also reached an all-time high last year under our stewardship.",1.3964413,0.976

Speaking of BNPL, in addition to the agreements we already have in place with leading solutions providers, including Affirm and Tua in the United States and [indiscernible] in Asia Pacific.

Our e-commerce and omni-channel business grew on an accelerated basis in 2021. Our ability to seamlessly provide the full spectrum of payment solutions drove new wins this quarter, with large multinational Mary Kay across 6 countries in Europe and Asia and with ESW or eShopWorld, a leader in direct-to-consumer global commerce in the United States with further global expansion on the horizon. And over the course of 2021, we also reached new partnerships with Google, Uber Eats and Uber Rides, Foot Locker, Hunter Douglas and the Swatch Group, while extending and expanding the scope of our longstanding relationship with PayPal.",1.1683274,0.872
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,20,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Finally, we added B2B as the newest pillar of our strategy in 2021. We are already making significant strides with MineralTree since the closing in mid-October. This includes doubling virtual card spend in the fourth quarter and completing 9 new deals in the healthcare vertical, including with know-how dental and biometrics. This quarter, MineralTree also renewed its agreement with NI or National Instruments, successfully executed an implementation with Mexico-based foodservices company, Grupo Bimbo, and launched its Supplier Central portal, which allows for seamless payments acceptance for suppliers to support greater digital adoption.",1.4409253,0.942

We also have returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders since that time. And our record cash flow generation and solid balance sheet position us with ample firepower to continue to execute on our priorities. At the same time, we seek to refine our portfolio by simplifying the composition of our businesses and focusing on our core corporate customers, including merchants, financial institutions, software partners and technology leaders.",1.66121,0.772
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,22,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"As part of that initiative, we have commenced a strategic review of our Netspend consumer business to sharpen our focus on our B2B assets. While Netspend's direct-to-consumer business is an attractive set of solutions with a favorable profile, there is limited overlap between that customer base and our traditional clients. Having largely completed our integration with TSYS corporately, made the pivot towards B2B and incorporated Netspend's B2B assets into our thinking. We believe now is the appropriate time to commence this review of Netspend's consumer business. As we said at our investor conference in September, we have a full suite of B2B assets, including a market-leading commercial card offering, virtual card issuance at scale, payroll, pay card, earned-wage access and now accounts payable cloud SaaS with MineralTree. We complement these offerings with a unique collaboration with AWS.",0.4487544,0.818
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,23,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"We are very proud of all that NetSpend and our valued team members have accomplished under TSYS' ownership over the last 8 plus years. We believe that we have created significant value since the close of our merger by expanding internationally, accelerating digitization and driving significant operational efficiencies. We also provided much needed faster payments to millions of consumers during some of the most challenging periods of the pandemic. Revenue, margin and contribution were all records at NetSpend in 2021. Simply put, we have achieved our goals. Paul?",1.683274,0.956
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,24,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Thanks, Jeff. Our financial performance for the full year 2021 exceeded our expectations despite incremental headwinds from COVID-19, including both the Delta and Omicron variants. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $7.74 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year and solidly ahead of our initial guidance for adjusted net revenue to be in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion.",0.0784024,0.637
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,25,Remarks,2022-02-10,4,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Importantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 41.8%, as we benefited from the natural operating leverage in the business and the continued realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which was partially offset by the return of certain costs that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic and the impact of our acquisitions during the year. This performance is also consistent with our guidance for adjusted operating margin expansion of around 200 basis points for the year, including the impact of acquisitions we closed during 2021.

GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,45,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Hi, Darrin, it's Cameron. I'll start, and I'll ask Jeff and Paul to jump in with any other details. So, maybe if you deconstruct a little bit the volume data that we are providing today. Obviously, we, I think, gave a good amount of disclosure here, as you highlighted. So year-over-year, our volumes in the fourth quarter grew 24% versus revenue growth of roughly 21%. And versus '19, that's back 28% versus growth of 16%. I would say what's impacting the delta is really the software businesses as it relates to the 2019 compare. If you look at our pure merchant businesses for the fourth quarter versus 2019, they were up probably 21%, 22% relative to that 28% growth in volume. So, a little bit of weighing of the software businesses against the 2019 result as a revenue matter. In terms of what's driving things, I think Paul gave a lot of detail in his script. We're obviously seeing very good trends in our technology-enabled businesses and obviously starting to see recovery in our software, pure software businesses, vertical market businesses as we head into 2022, even though they are still a little bit depressed versus 2019 levels. But again, Integrated had a terrific quarter yet again. It's compounded rate of growth over the last couple of years been in that mid-teen range. We continue to see good performance in our point-of-sale software businesses, having grown 53% this quarter and roughly 50% year-over-year, continue to see good performance in our payroll and HCM businesses, as Paul highlighted in his script. So it's pretty clear that the technology-enabled businesses have continued to drive growth in our overall portfolio and our overall results. And as we head into 2022, the software businesses we expect to provide, the vertical market software businesses we expect to provide a nice tailwind to growth for the year in overall in 2022.",1.0927771,0.987
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,46,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Darrin, it's Jeff. I would just add to what Cameron said a couple of things. First, we see continued strength in our e-com business, as Paul alluded to in his prepared remarks, which we're really pleased with in the fourth quarter heading into the year. Darrin, I'd say is we exceeded our forecast in January, which we feel good about to start the year, obviously, our guides our guide. But we feel good about the trajectory, and we did see a recovery in volumes towards the end of January into early February in certain selected verticals that we're in. So we feel like it's tracking very nicely versus our guide today, and we're kind of pleased with the start to the year.",0.2661922,0.973
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,48,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, it's a great question, Darrin. So let me just start with the strategy portion of what you asked. So I really think the pivot has been quite some time incoming. If you think about the company for a second, go back to the investor conference in September, we really positioned the business as adding another leg to the stool with B2B. Netspend has significant B2B assets pre-MineralTree and, of course, post October with MineralTree even more significant B2B assets. So we really view the September investor conference as kind of a linchpin in terms of our strategic set and where our focus in our thesis really needs to be And I think the success of the integration that we referred to in our prepared remarks around MineralTree, and Paul gave the 19% bookings number, as well as the payments penetration into that business is something we're very excited about. So we're off to a really good start. So we think from that point of view, we like the predicate in September, the execution was very good through the fourth quarter. We think we're in good shape as a guidance matter in B2B. So I think the right thing to do, therefore, is to focus on highlighting those assets that are consistent with the long-term strategy of the company, which is really on the corporate client focus. I kind of listed that to my script, software companies, technology leaders. And we're really not a B2C direct kind of company, which is the part we referred to really in the presentation. So I think the strategy shift has been some time in coming. I think September was a big milestone. I think the closing of military in October was a big milestone. And I view this as kind of the next milestone.",1.4085409,0.987
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,49,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"On your question about allocation of process, look, it's going to depend where things are if and when we reach the point where we have something that we would execute. You saw our announcement today about increasing our buyback up to another $2 billion. Just to be clear, that amount does not assume any disposition of Netspend. So, if that were to happen and if we were to retire more capital, then that would be incremental to the $2 billion repurchased about 6% of the company stock since the 2020 period. That doesn't include the current $2 billion depending on where things shake out over periods of time that could be another 5%. And then obviously, if we reduce something with Netspend, along the line that you asked, and if we were to repurchase stock, that would be incremental to that number. So it's just going to depend on the facts and circumstances at the time that we do it. I don't expect it - this is something we proceed with. It would be later this year in calendar '22, our guidance, our guide. And I don't expect it to have all that significant impact depending on when it happens in 2022. But that's something we will address if and when we kind of reach that decision point.",0.702847,0.494
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,54,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Sure, Bryan. So if you kind of think, and a lot of it is just going to depend on how the strategic review goes, what potential buyers' interest level is in the various pieces. But just at a high level, the way to kind of think about it is roughly 15% of the business is kind of the B2B assets that Jeff was just referring to. And obviously, the two biggest components of that are our pay card business as well as the MineralTree business. I would highlight just as an add-on to what Jeff said, both of those businesses have high-growth characteristics to them and certainly higher than the consumer piece. Both businesses on a fundamental basis, grew double digits in the fourth quarter and have that consistent kind of growth rate on a forward-looking basis relative to kind of the cycle guide range that we want for the company. So the fundamentals of those businesses have those kind of characteristics strategically, but also it's just a growth matter as well. As it relates to the fit, the overall fit, we talked about this, obviously, in the Investor Day, but there is a lot of kind of synergistic benefits with the commercial card business, obviously, B2B that we have in our issuer business, which also grows at a faster rate in a normalized environment. Obviously, it's been a headwind to our growth there in the pandemic. And kind of between what MineralTree has and what we have in that solution set around the broader B2B apparatus that we have in issuer is a nice fit. And I would just mention on the pay card side, obviously, what we do on our payroll business in our Merchant Solutions kind of segment has some nice synergistic benefits. So yes, I mean that's - as Jeff said, that's kind of the strategy. It's why we're interested in keeping those kind of B2B assets and look to kind of strategically review the consumer assets.",0.605694,0.994
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,56,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, it's a great question, Bryan. Thanks. So we're really pleased to announce that today. As I said in the prepared remarks, it's 30 million cards. This is a really big deal, and we expect to be live in the back half of next year towards the end of next year. And as all said, this is said in the prepared comments, in it's a big deal about it is it's direct to the cloud. So we're taking a traditional institution with a good book of business of 30 million cards and going live kind of day 1 in a cloud-based environment, which as you know, is something we've invested very heavily in, at least since August of 2020. The other thing I'd like to point out, Bryan, given the size of it is - what we said in our slide show today is we have 31 million accounts on file in our implementation pipeline today at TSYS issuer. This is another 30 million, that's not that number, Bryan. So that would actually double the implementation pipeline, just to give you a sense of size. And we think this would be one of our top two or three customers in Europe by way of size. As I said in the press release this morning, this will also make us among the largest debit technology providers in all of Europe. So it's a really big deal at the end of the day. I'd also say, as it relates to the 31 million existing accounts on file that are currently implementation pipeline, 22 million are coming online live this year at TSYS in 2022. So this is a really big increment and also very nicely as we grow, as Paul said, throughout the year in 2022 in Issuer, this adds a very healthy pipeline plus Truist, which we previously announced in 2023, as well as Virgin Money. So we're super positive about where it is. As it relates to Caixa more broadly, look, this is something that Caixa conducted an extensive RFP on. You would imagine that they went extensively to kind of compare our technologies versus new entrants as well as other providers in the marketplace in Europe and globally, and we couldn't be more pleased that they selected us. And obviously, we've got great feedback coming out of it. So it gives us a lot of confidence in the remainder of this year's growth. Given the current pipeline but double the pipeline heading into next year, which makes us feel really good about the next 18 months.",0.4907473,0.984
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,61,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Ashwin, it's Jeff. I'll start speaking the issuer, and then I'll ask Cameron and Paul, and we give a lot of bookings detail this morning, but I'll ask them to comment on merchant. So listen, no surprise to you, Ashwin or anyone listening to the call, initial or the cloud sales. So I gave that example, Caixa, direct-to-cloud not looking for any kind of intermediate step in between. We also announced today a new partnership with Mastercard, which will put online transaction data directly into cloud with AWS, which means as a consumer you can actually look online live at your postings and overdue balances and see really kind of real-time flows through AWS and the cloud, and that's really just with us for the next period of time through the remainder of the year when it goes live. So look, I would say that on the cloud side, things are moving very quickly. We announced the KB deal in the Czech Republic, which is a legacy Global Payments culture going direct to prime in the cloud, which is a big deal. We announced the other customer in Asia, also going live in prime in the cloud as well. So I would say as it relates to decision-making and phase of implementation. I would say the cloud, which was part of our thesis when we did the deal in the first place has really accelerated the time to market. Now why would that be? Number one, I think it's very topical for most CTOs and large banks. Number two, I would say, if you look at the historical TSYS model of kind of buying it off in one place, and Paul alluded to the managed services side of the business, which is really call center functionality, what we're really emphasizing going forward is micro services and decomposed deconstructed APIs. So you can kind of buy by the drink with us. And you're seeing some of the early wins here, which would accelerate decision-making, Ashwin. Some of the early wins around prime live in the cloud, which is what we kind of announced today. And then with Caixa, you're seeing whole enterprises what would have been TS2, but whole enterprise is going direct to the cloud live. So I would say that the pivot toward cloud is certainly short circuited some of the timeframes you might have seen historically. We are live with that with use cases with Prime and obviously, with Caixa will be live with that in the back half of 2023, as we said today. So, certainly on the issuer side, I feel good about it. I would also say before I turn it over to Cameron and Paul, our merchant that we announced today two partnerships with ecolytiq and Xtend. These are neobank, fintech startup kind of companies. They are focused on selling ESG microservices and APIs into all manner of new wave issuers, the same thing with Xtend on the virtual card side. We are providing virtual card technology from TSYS into the B2B space. That's something we never would have been able to do historically by way of distribution. We are doing that here through AWS and PwC. Those are all incremental and things that we described is tripling the TAM back when we announced Ashwin, the August 20, AWS unique collaboration. So, I do agree with your thesis that we are seeing acceleration in sales opportunities on the issuing side. Cam, do you want to talk a little about merchants.",0.7896797,0.989
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,62,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Sure. Good morning Ashwin. I would say, obviously, we provided some booking data today for the merchant business for the full year 2021 plus 20%, obviously suggesting we have a lot of positive momentum from a new sales and execution standpoint heading into 2022. I would highlight a few things. One is we continue to see positive tailwinds coming out of the pandemic for our safer commerce solutions, our omnichannel solutions and our commerce enablement solutions. What we are really seeing with our core merchant customer base is there is strong demand for technology. There is strong demand for efficiency and there is strong demand for solutions that help offset the fact that hiring is very difficult right now. So, the more we can bring to bear on our customers to help them again run their businesses more effectively and find opportunities to grow their business, the more traction we are achieving from a sales perspective than the new market. So, our targets for 2022, I would say, are roughly consistent in terms of growth as to what we achieved in 2021 as a new bookings matter. We have a lot of confidence and momentum heading into the year that we will be able to execute against that. The last thing I will say is as we started 2022, we have actually brought our U.S. payments business and our GPI business together as a distribution matter, which will allow us to really unleash our relationship managers in the U.S. payments channel on our GPI partner customers. So, this gives us new opportunities, I think to accelerate growth, have a smoother go-to-market motion from a sales and distribution perspective here in the U.S. And I think unlock untapped value that exists in that portfolio of vertical market partners that we have in the GPI business by attacking it with a broader sales force going forward. So, I think we have a lot of confidence around where we are from the new sales and execution. And very simply put, I don't think we have ever been in a better place as a distribution matter, particularly from a technology-enabled distribution perspective, nor have we been in a better place in terms of the product group solutions and capabilities that we can bring to bear on the market. So, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to continue the trends we saw coming out of 2021 from the new sales and bookings standpoint. And I think, obviously, that underlies the guide that we provided for 2022 as well for the merchant business.",2.1665629,0.997
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,64,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes. So, just as you said, the biggest kind of impact that we would call out would be the whole stimulus impact in the business and consumer. The good thing about that, just as a comparison dynamic, is the stimulus impact is largely secluded to that first quarter. So, we don't have that kind of playing through the other quarters. I would say at a segment level, if you just kind of take the overall guide and just look at it first at merchant, we are in that kind of low-teens in the first half and then that kind of low-double digit kind of in the second half. And that's largely just depending on the comp that you are kind of comparing to in the dynamics in that quarter. So, that's kind of somewhat of a breakout between the first half and the second half. And then I would say, from the issuer business, it's kind of more higher-single digit growth in the back half, more kind of mid-single digit growth more in the first half, and we do have some kind of ramping of commercial card recovery occurring throughout the year. So, that provides a little more pressure in the first quarter. It kind of improves in the second quarter, the third quarter and fourth quarter. One thing we did see, and this was underlying the guides, we did see some deceleration between 3Q and 4Q in commercial card in our issuer business. And so we are kind of now projecting that maybe to take some time to recover. And so you are going to kind of see that thing play throughout the year as we do expect commercial card to kind of recover to a more normalized level in a more normalized environment. And finally, on that B and C line, obviously, I called out what the impact is in the first quarter and then it kind of goes to that more mid-single digit, higher-single digit kind of growth rates in the back half of the year as we anniversary that first quarter. So, that kind of gives you a broader context of how we look at next year. Obviously, things will play themselves out. We will give more color as the year progresses, but that's how we are looking at it right now.",2.0281065,0.833
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,69,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Hi James, it's Jeff. It's a great question. So, I would say a few things to what you asked. Look, we have a long pipeline of opportunities, but I think we are very cognizant that we are generating really attractive returns by buying back the stock. So, while we have a lot of things that we could do on the strategic side to get the returns that we are looking at in the stock market from buying back our own stock, the bar is just pretty high at the end of the day. We are just finishing a period where we generated something like $2.5 billion thereabouts in free cash flow. We ticked up leverage a little bit up to around 3x on a debt basis, as Paul said. And get some like $2.5 billion of available capacity. So, there is really no shortage of things we can continue to do. As I said in response to one of the earlier questions, we have already bought back 6% of the stock since the pandemic kind of started. We will do another 5% more or less this year, depending on conditions if we exhaust the $2 billion that I mentioned today. And if we redeploy Netspend, if that were to occur, depending on how we redeploy that, that could be another big chunk coming back in. So, the nice thing about where we are game is we have tons of free cash flow generation and a very high conversion rate, which we reiterate today and a very good expansion of margins. So, plenty of capacity from cash on hand, free cash flow conversion and leverage capacity to invest in our business. The question for us is where - what side of pendulum do you kind of fall on, and clearly, as we just suggested, we have been more on the side, I think the number I gave was $3. 7 billion of buybacks relative to $2.5 billion. Clearly, the most recent period, given where the stock has gone in the market and the dislocations in fintech, clearly, we have aired rightly so more in the side of buybacks. So, it will depend. I would say at the end of the day, leverage markets remain very favorable. Pulp coated our recent capital raise in November, which was like 2.27% pretax, which is a very attractive rate. Having done $2.5 billion more or less of free cash flow last year, we will do an increment this year. So, we have done a lot of avenues that we can pursue. So, we have no real practical constraint. As we said in September, at the investor conference, we expect to have $30 billion of available free cash flow leverage capacity over the next 3-year to 5-year cycle. You saw the $6 billion in the press release just since 2020. So, we are well on track on the $30 billion. But certainly, given where things are today, our thumb is on the scale of repurchase, and that's what you saw some of this morning.",1.4263345,0.997
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,71,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Paul Michael Todd,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,"Yes, sure. So yes, the answer to your first part of the question is, yes, kind of the exiting of 2022 is in that kind of double-digit kind of growth range that we talked about, both in our September investor conference and kind of how we look at the business. So - and certainly, we are, as I said in the prepared remarks, preparing for a more progressively normalized environment throughout the year next year. So yes, that's our vision of the way we look at 2022. As it relates to OpEx and kind of margin, I wouldn't necessarily call out anything with the exception of that first quarter we would have kind of margin headwind related to the flow-through of all the stimulus kind of impact. But absent that, this 100 basis point kind of fundamental margin expansion up to 100 basis points or up to 150 basis points ex-M&A kind of would be a pretty good guide as you look throughout the following three quarters. And as it relates to specifically kind of segment level between both merchant and issuer both of those segments are in that range. And then obviously, we don't have the same kind of margin expansion expectations for BMC given that rollover as it relates to stimulus.",1.7174556,0.978
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,74,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"I wouldn't necessarily kind of go to that kind of level of granularity as it relates to kind of the growth rate you are right in that kind of overall sizing of the growth rate that you mentioned there. But as it relates to the components drive it kind of just maybe go back to what Cameron provided earlier, and he may have some additional comments as well, but that our tech-enabled and particularly, we would highlight kind of integrated and obviously, some of the software assets that we talked about in the prepared remarks would be on the higher side of that kind of growth pendulum and then on the lower side or some of the other businesses in certain geographies, vertical markets, obviously, depending on the recovery dynamics in those various businesses kind of play their way through. We have kind of assumptions on each one of those around the recovery and how those look throughout the year. And there are some timing elements with some of those. So, that would be the right way to kind of think about it, higher growth on the tech-enabled side. Certainly, that's the right kind of overall growth rate. And Cameron, I don't know if you have anything else to add.",0.6982206,0.981
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,75,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, maybe just a few other points that I would call out specifically. So, maybe to start with, there is about a point of FX headwind kind of in that number. So, if you think about it on a normalized constant currency basis, it's going to be a little bit higher. So, there is a few things, I think going on that are worthy of calling out. Certainly, in the U.S., we expect to see continued strong trends. We have seen a good recovery in the U.S., so probably not quite as much of a tailwind in 2022 from a U.S. recovery, because a lot of that has flowed through. But still a little bit of tailwind there. We expect to see more tailwind coming out of our vertical market software businesses, of course, as Paul highlighted earlier, as we continue to see recovery in the specific verticals that have been more heavily impacted by the pandemic kind of heading into 2022. And we still have a little bit of runway left, I would say, internationally from a recovery standpoint from the pandemic as well that gives us a little bit of a tailwind overall. But clearly, growth is going to continue to be led by our technology-enabled businesses. As Paul highlighted earlier, we continue to have strong expectations for GPI. As I mentioned earlier, by unleashing additional sales resources against that channel, we expect to be able to drive incremental opportunities there. Clearly, e-com and our omnichannel solutions remain very robust from a demand standpoint, we saw great growth in those in 2021, and 2022 is starting out well on that front, and will continue to be a tailwind for the business as well. And then our other software and commerce enablement solutions across HCM and payroll, POS solutions, etcetera, our analytics and customer engagement platform as we roll out our Google Run and Grow My Business solutions this year. Obviously, those will be a nice tailwind to growth overall for the year. So again, overall, the business will, I think, produce results above the long-term sort of expectations we have for the business, largely benefiting by continued recovery from the pandemic in 2022. But to the earlier question, as we head into 2023, we would expect that environment to largely normalize and you will continue to see sort of double-digit growth for the merchant business heading into 2023.",1.7942092,0.995
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,77,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. So, you are right. In the fourth quarter, we kind of had three dynamics at play. And certainly, I have talked about all three, too, in the prepared remarks. One was managed services, as Jeff commented, as we continue to pivot this business to the cloud and more tech enablement, the lower margin kind of human interactive kind of managed services business is not one that we are focused on. We are very kind of margin tenant in this business, and that is a lower margin business that continues to have more compressed margins. So, it's one that kind of re-deemphasizing. We are certainly continuing to stay in the business and offering it, but we are going to do it when we get a good margin for the business. So, that is kind of one kind of piece of the headwind in the quarter. We did have some things in the fourth quarter of last year. One customer particularly had to meet some minimums and a few other things that kind of play through that just didn't recur in the fourth quarter of this year. So, that's kind of the tougher comp piece I was talking about. And then as I commented on, we saw, relative to our expectations, kind of that deceleration on the commercial card side that had that continued to trajectory like we would have anticipated. But for the impact of Omicron, that's back where we see that business solidly in that mid-single digit range. I would say also that for fourth quarter, the volume-based revenue, our account on found transaction revenue for that fourth quarter was solidly in that mid-single digit range. So, as we go forward, yes, it's going to be continued kind of compression on the managed services side for next year. So, we will see that kind of play out once again, in the first quarter, we had some more comp there. We will see a progressive improvement on the commercial card side. And we are seeing solid or certainly projecting both with what Jeff talked about on the conversion pipeline as well as what we saw from transactions and our forecast so far and what we are seeing in transactions, solidly mid-single digit growth with that account on file revenue and transaction revenue really throughout the year. So - but for kind of the few things I mentioned, it's a pretty solid kind of mid-single digit growth year for us next year - this year in line with that expectation. And I think that kind of provides the picture you are looking for.",1.25,0.993
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,81,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, it's a great question. This is Cameron. I will start, and I will ask Jeff and Paul to jump in as well. I would say we have seen good traction already in our ability to cross-sell MineralTree into our existing base of not only merchant customers, but partners. In particular, in the GPI channel, we have a significant number of roughly 6,000 software partners for whom the MineralTree solution is the ideal solution given the size of their business to manage kind of their automation and to help with their overall B2B payment requirements of software companies. So, as we think about the long-term proposition, we think MineralTree as a standalone sort of point solution is fantastic. And we have seen good traction in our ability to cross-sell it into our existing base of business. But more importantly, it becomes a core underlying foundational component of what we think will be an end-to-end B2B solution that in companies, both AP automation, AR automation, disbursements and acceptance capabilities in an end-to-end platform that seamless fully integrated and able to be deployed to our merchant customers through our digital ecosystem. So, as we think about the long-term B2B strategy, I think it's really that. It's building that end-to-end capabilities with money-in, money-out capabilities with AP automation, AR automation, with integrations into general ledger environments, which is really what our customers are looking for. So, MineralTree on its own has been a great tailwind as we look to cross-sell new product and capability into the merchant base. But as we continue to build out the B2B strategy long-term, it becomes more important as that foundational element to build out the end-to-end capability.",1.7201121,0.996
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,82,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Jeffrey Steven Sloan,Chief Executive Officer & Director,"Yes, Vasu, it's Jeff. I would add to what Cameron said on the issuer side that we have some like 1,300 bank partners in issuer. I think MineralTree had like 20 to 30 when we did the deal in October. One of the things that we heard from banks was the product of MineralTree, very similar to Cameron said, is terrific, but financial institutions being where they are always worried about the size of the company and the balance sheet exposure and that kind of thing. Well, there is no concerns about that with us. So, we see great traction on the issuing side with that by customers globally, not just here in the United States and MineralTree is predominantly a U.S. only business, although we did announce some overseas stuff with them today. So, our ability to expand that in the United States and export it globally, I think, is very attractive to us and it's something that we are super excited about.",2.105694,0.989
GPN-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,84,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Cameron M. Bready,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. I think you hit the nail on the head. I think it's really just mix differences. I don't think there is an appreciable difference, to be honest with you, when you are aggregating that level of data together. I think if you look at it across the globe, I think our trends are very consistent sort of sequentially with what we saw coming out of the network. So look, there is always going to be noise in the data because we are running a particular mix of business. The networks represent more of the markets. So, there are things that we are benefiting from that they are not. There is things that are benefiting from that we are not as it relates to the mix of businesses. But I would characterize from our perspective, the trend is generally in line with what we saw coming out of the network sort of sequentially Q3 to Q4.",1.2437733,0.718
