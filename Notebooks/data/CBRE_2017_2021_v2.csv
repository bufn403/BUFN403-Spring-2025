CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,11,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appeared to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear, over the last five years CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS, and about 70% total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet. These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue.",0.2235033,0.983
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,12,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they are increasingly sophisticated. And they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand and I think that's under appreciated. Our global scale, the breadth of our services we can offer, and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition. And it's showing up in our financial performance.",0.3201774,0.944
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,13,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength. Institutional capital allocations to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously debt costs are declining while underwriting standards, loan to value ratios, and cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet CBRE is operating from a position of strength. As a result we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us and we'll remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future. And with that let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter.",0.2833703,0.957
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,14,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA which was driven by an 11% increase in fee revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost disciplines as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis. As Bob noted, leasing within our Advisory business was once again particularly strong increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%.",0.2709534,0.902
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,15,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"During the quarter co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately one percentage point to growth. Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust declining by 1% in U.S. dollars but increasing 5% in local currency. Our combined capital markets business comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination grew by 5% in Q2 up from a slight decline in Q1. Americas property sales increased 8% reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018.",0.5184035,0.916
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,16,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC where fundamentals remain weak. Excluding residential commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volumes. Global Commercial Mortgage Origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. Debt markets globally remains very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt fund, CMBS, and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.",0.8629712,0.332
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,17,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for our outsourcing offering remains strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagements. In fact in April we onboarded 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest Go Live Day in history.",0.3414634,0.785
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,18,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,During the quarter fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX. Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS was our Americas team which generates approximately 70% of the segments adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019.,0.5796009,0.912
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,19,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Within GWS we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the facility source capabilities we acquired last year. We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. In fact multi service clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for six consecutive quarters. In Canada for example we just won a long-term contract to manage all of the facilities and real estate related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. We were able to unseat a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool.",0.0297118,0.947
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,20,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility technology to drive operating cost savings, improve reporting, and enhance business performance for our clients. Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by a handful of discrete items such as a decrease in health insurance reserves which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating costs, leverage our scale, and increase our selectivity in client pursuit. The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.",0.2904656,0.976
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,21,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to our real estate investment segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remain solid including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering, and our in process development portfolio which reached a new record level during the quarter. During the quarter the real estate investment segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA which was mostly attributable to our development business. We hadn't anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters. This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example over the last five years our development business generated nearly 600 million of adjusted EBITDA while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE.",0.681153,0.923
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,22,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,Based on the quality of our development pipeline and our Trammell Crow company franchise we expect even stronger financial performance over the next five years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs. During the quarter investment management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up 4 million or 32% in local currency. This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management which are up $5 billion versus the prior year to nearly $107 billion.,0.7764967,0.912
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,23,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Finally the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business incurred modest costs which were consistent with our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities amid rising demands from occupiers. Further we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square foot first class space at PwC Tower in Dallas.",0.4576497,0.934
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,24,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 8, simply put CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 terms of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. Taking into account our planned acquisitions we expect that we can invest about a $1 billion for the remainder of the year while maintaining net debt at around one time trailing adjusted EBITDA. In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 cents to $3.80 per share.",0.1756098,0.84
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,25,Remarks,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,The $3.75 midpoint reflects a $0.15 increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. If achieved this will be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter than in 2018 due to the expected timing of development disposition. Specifically we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investment segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year. And with that I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks.,0.340133,0.9
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,28,Question,2019-08-01,2,2019,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,Good morning. My first question is on leasing and the strength there despite a tough comp into 2Q 2018. Can you talk a little bit more about what's happening there particularly and how much of this you think is really market share gains versus the market itself?,0.2449744,0.891
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,30,Question,2019-08-01,2,2019,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay, and so do you think that this high level of growth will be present in the second half of the year because the comps remain pretty high?",0.6868825,0.772
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,32,Question,2019-08-01,2,2019,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay, thanks for that. And then second item on capital markets, it seems like there are some mixed signals between some of the data and end performance there. Can you talk a little bit more about just what's happening on the ground as it really relates to investment sales activity and also just mortgage side in light of lower interest rates?",0.7022147,0.796
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,33,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure, Anthony it is Leah. I'll talk to the capital markets piece first. I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of 2018. At this point we think that given the level of activity in the Americas was strong in Q2 that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact. And so that includes capital allocations to real estate and how they continue to rise, debt costs are declining to your point, and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuations.",0.0523282,0.878
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,34,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,So all in all we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1 our advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So this shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our advisory segment.,0.0820399,0.949
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,35,Question,2019-08-01,2,2019,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,"Got it and then last question, if we just think about combined principal business EBITDA for this year for the full year versus 2018 any guide posts on that given updated guidance and potential acquisitions and so forth?",0.7151618,0.0
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,36,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,I'd really just say in terms of the real estate investment segment we're expecting the seasonality to be quite different from 2018 but all in all given the fact that we're not updating outlook at a detailed level we do believe we're tracking ahead of guidance. But we do expect that seasonality to be in the first and fourth quarter in 2019 compared to what we saw in 2018 which was the second and third quarter strength.,1.0487805,0.649
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,40,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,We are seeing that wide spread across most industries. I mean we did see some benefits from recruiting. We saw some M&A but overall we did have a really strong diverse set of demand coming through leasing.,0.3201774,0.713
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,45,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So we're seeing the pipeline certainly increase. We've seen six consecutive quarters of our pipeline attributable to clients who are looking for what we call three acts, all three lines of business or full service. And so today we're actually at nearly 30% of our current client base using that level.",0.5104213,0.572
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,47,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,Certainly we're seeing a pickup in demand as indicated from those six consecutive quarters of increase through our pipeline. I think it just goes to show that there is an opportunity for us to expand client services within GWS not just from a service line but also geographically. And so when we take on a new client through our pursuits sometimes it starts out on a regional basis and we're able to grow that organically as we provide services both across their real estate footprint both from geographic perspective as well as service line.,0.1844789,0.743
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,51,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So I think just going back to my comments around the fundamentals of commercial real estate, I mean we see those as really what's driving the opportunities within our capital markets business. And so I would point more to just overall enthusiasm and the relative value opportunity for real estate as it presents itself today for investors as opposed to more of the macro trends that you're alluding to.",0.9685144,0.866
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,60,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,It certainly was up and in terms of the pace it was back-end loaded.,0.5973392,0.34
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,62,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure, and maybe just to touch on GWS for a second. I mean I think we see broad based strength in that business not just from the service lines but also given that we're providing that service across broad geographies. And so as a result I think while FM is our largest part of that business transactions were up significantly year-over-year. And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we are leveraging the strengths between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS, we are seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but as I mentioned earlier there is a clear expansion of our customer relationships and now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients and that is allowing us to expand obviously the services that we provide and that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction.",0.5600887,0.99
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,63,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes facility source and it also includes capabilities like our data center solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition, it's resulting in the record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to you before as well as that six consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of a pursuit pipeline. So all in all we are really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuits. We are aligning our interests with our clients and that's allowing us to develop deeper capabilities and I think long-term that's going to lead to stronger profitability of that segment and really unmatched outcomes that we're providing to our clients that they cannot find elsewhere.",0.421286,0.929
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,67,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Oh sure, in terms of and you're talking about 2019 in particular.",0.8620843,0.318
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,69,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Okay, no I think that that component of our business we do expect to be fourth quarter weighted and given the strength last year that will certainly be an easier comp than the third quarter.",0.2922395,0.796
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,73,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, and so in terms of the capital we have available we do believe that we have a very strong pipeline in terms of opportunities. Certainly we look at M&A and then we consider our share repurchase program will be disciplined in our approach to both of those. And we've bought back about 45 million shares this year and we clearly have some large M&A on our plate to absorb in the second half. But I think it was just important to demonstrate the scale of the capacity that we have and the strength of our balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic to the extent that we find unique opportunities in the market again both from an M&A as well as a share repurchase perspective.",0.3875831,0.977
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,77,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So I would just say in terms of the capital market environment in the Americas in particular no, we did see velocity increase so the pace of transactions pick up. I don't have specific to the statistics that you're pointing to from prior quarters but all in all we think that we're seeing strong dynamics and trends around investors' appetite within the capital markets business. We did see the average marketing time fall in the second quarter so that goes to my velocity comment that it's picking up.",0.4722838,0.799
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,83,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. I think one of the key components of the rework was to remove as much redundancy as possible throughout the management layers, the organization, and so we're seeing that happen and it's playing out in terms of supporting that stronger operating leverage for the business. In addition we have put leadership roles in place like our COO who are clearly focused and directly focused on cost reductions and making sure that our business is very focused on transparency and accountability across the organization. And so we believe that those specific steps that were carried out through the rework are having direct impact on our margins today, will continue.",0.4829268,0.968
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,91,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, we're seeing really nice performance coming out of that business. It's tracking in line with our underwriting and we think we prefer seeing really strong momentum. I spoke about that in my prepared remarks particularly around the retail segment. So our clients are excited about the expanded capability and we believe its helping us win new business, it's helping us provide additional services to our customers and I think that certainly goes to those key trends that I've reiterated around GWS.",0.2567627,0.967
CBRE-2019-Q2-2019-08-01,93,Answer,2019-08-01,2,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure, I think that's just an indication or an acknowledgment of the strength we've seen in the business in the first half of the year. We're not updating outlook to the level that we provided in March but the key drivers of our confidence behind the $0.15 increase are really the fact that our segments are tracking ahead of our expectations and that we're seeing really strong margin growth in Advisory and GWS. So given the fact that from an advisory perspective we're seeing leasing continue to be the standout, we know we continue to expect to see strength across our segment lines.",0.1494457,0.975
CBRE-2019-Q1-2019-05-08,10,Remarks,2019-05-08,1,2019,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our three business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS. The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business, and helping to make us a more efficient, client focused company.",0.0026087,0.978
CBRE-2019-Q1-2019-05-08,11,Remarks,2019-05-08,1,2019,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"For example, our two Real Estate Services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions realized the combined 190 basis points increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter. Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one off transactions and account based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry.",0.0310349,0.965
CBRE-2019-Q1-2019-05-08,12,Remarks,2019-05-08,1,2019,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We are able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform. Our global workplace solutions segment which serves large account based clients again saw fee revenue increased by double digits in local currency.

Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline.

We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families' good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base. A significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure.",0.1070031,0.973
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,10,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively in early to take out nonessential costs. In early April, I decided to forgo my salary and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely, economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks. Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13.",0.1228804,-0.45
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,11,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite five examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution.",0.0877974,0.977

CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,14,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to slide eight. Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses.",0.313082,0.874
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,15,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest market, France and Germany delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior two quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.",0.34102,0.956
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,16,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide nine. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.",0.302439,0.948
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,17,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions.",1.595122,0.886
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,18,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million and adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter. Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.",0.6159645,0.7
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,19,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our two largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiments.",0.6221729,-0.557

We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio.",1.1348115,0.077
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,21,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thus far, a dominiums number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about two-three of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions decline in steps with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in advisory. Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations.",0.6443459,0.93

Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges and on boarding new clients as a result of the current shelter in place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts.",0.1827051,0.921

We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work. Looking at REI.",0.1454545,0.955
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,24,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training.",0.178714,0.967
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,25,Remarks,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020. Until we have more clarity around COVID-19 impact on occupier demand. Turning to slide 12. Our financial position is strong, we ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth.

And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position.

Can you give us any initial thoughts on what you think the potential positive as well as the potential negative implications for your business long-term are that you see right now?",0.8262351,0.66
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,35,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"I can, Tony. So, I'm going to start with industrial space. Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices.",0.0511402,0.401
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,36,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last three years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors, one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera.",0.061935,0.93
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,37,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites type high-quality with real data security very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens.",0.0326991,0.911
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,38,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now.",0.0114694,0.725
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,39,Question,2020-05-07,1,2020,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay. And on the outsourcing side, you gave a little color on just potential pressure points there. But do you think the EBITDA from that business still grows in 2020? Or is there just too many pressure points at this point for that to go up?",0.39523,-0.433
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,40,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So Tony, it's Leah. We're not giving explicit guidance around EBITDA for the business. But I would say that we do expect, just given the tailwind of new contract wins from 2019, we do believe revenue will grow. I think we're just being cautious given the fact that the operational conditions that exist around COVID-19 and our desire to manage and be prepared to accelerate out of this, we may take on some costs that otherwise we would not have. And so we just want to have the ability to manage through this in a more agile way then I think if we committed today that EBITDA would grow, we wouldn't be able to do that.",1.5964523,0.87
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,41,Question,2020-05-07,1,2020,Anthony Paolone,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay. And then last one for me. The GSE business are more specifically the Fannie stuff, you mentioned maybe some capital needs in the near term. Can you put any numbers around that? And also whether or not you've started to take any reserves for any potential loss sharing?",2.967632,-0.193
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,42,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. So maybe just to start, with the CECL adoption at one-one, we did increase our reserve for our loan losses by about $15 million as of one-one, and that's on the balance sheet. We did take an incremental $5 million reserve on top of that through the P&L. So you'll see that in our results. We have not normalized for that. But Fannie, as it relates to the loan loss reserve and any potential funding for forbearance is fairly minimal. We actually have a very strong portfolio of loans in that part of our business, and we don't see that as having a material impact on our overall cash position.",0.4713969,0.612
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,46,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So, I'll take sales, and I'll let Bob speak to leasing activity. But with respect to sales, there were certainly some assets that were in the pipeline where terms had already been set and so certain activity has come through. With respect to industrial and logistics, that continues to be an asset class, where we're seeing strength and activity continues. The issue for slowing down that has been the primary hurdle for folks has been around inspections, on-site tours. And those are things that we would expect as shelter in place orders are lifted. We would be able to address. And in addition, we've used technology to provide more virtual visual access to space so that folks can continue doing diligence as needed.",0.8155211,0.95
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,47,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes, Jason, as it relates to leasing, it's really a similar scenario to what Leah described for sales. First of all, it's heavily impacted by the fact that you can't get out and show space. Nobody's figured out how to get around that yet. And we of course, we've only been at it for a couple of months. So we completed transactions that were in the pipeline. And we, of course, have a significant base of our transactions that are renewals, and I think historically, that's been about 30% of our leasing, so that continued. But there is definitely a big impact on leasing when you can't go look at the space. And when people just have huge uncertainty in general about how long this COVID-19 thing is going to go. So we saw the downward pressure to the degree that we had described, it was down 40%, and we're going to wait and see how that plays out from here.",0.0663878,0.71
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,49,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. So the 10b5-1 plan that we had in place in Q1 was designed really to take advantage of volatile markets and I certainly think the volatility that we saw was more pronounced than what we had expected when the plan was put in place. And so it was actually executed fairly quickly in March. So as a result of that, we typically, for our programmatic share repurchase program, which effectively offsets our stock-based compensation expense, look to do that over the course of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate that. For Q2, I would just say, we're putting a premium on liquidity. We believe the visibility that we'll have into the second half of the year as the next two months unfold will be critical to our assessment in terms of future opportunity for capital allocation and the deployment of our excess liquidity. And so we are going to take a pause just in Q2 to ensure that we're able to have that visibility and how the year unfolds, and we'll look to reassess in August.",0.1237251,0.921
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,53,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So, we're actually seeing those proposals and RFP processes continue. We're having day-long scoping sessions with clients so presume, but it becomes more complicated when there are shelter in place orders so that our teams can't get out and actually fully implement the on-boarding of those new accounts. So, we aren't seeing a slowdown in terms of discussions or activity as it relates to bringing on or assessing new clients' RFPs or expansion or scope discussions. It really is just the operational complexity of us not being mobile.",0.6926829,0.0
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,55,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Josh, our M&A strategy really hasn't changed. Like everything else we're doing, it's kind of slowed down in the immediate period that we're going through as people try to figure out what they're going to do with their businesses, etcetera. People are very preoccupied by and distracted by COVID-19. No matter what else we would say. It's just a fact they're preoccupied and distracted. But our strategy for M&A remains the same, and we see the same kind of opportunities we saw before. We'll probably because of the relative strength of our balance sheet and some pressure that people might be underweight could see more opportunities. But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge a lot of market presence and other things.",0.0167769,0.741
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,56,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our three segments going forward, and we're not pushing any one segment more or less than the others. We're asking each of them to look for opportunities to build their business with M&A, where those businesses we buy can do more on the CBRE platform than they could do on their own or on another platform. We're encouraged that those opportunities will arise.",0.0522197,0.925
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,58,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So, we aren't seeing a real shift in terms of the competitive landscape on the mortgage origination front. We are we have a significant position as it relates to origination for the GSEs, and that has certainly been a major part of our underlying DSF business. But from a CMBS perspective, the GSEs have a liquidity role to play in the market. And so we're continuing to see them provide liquidity. What we are seeing though is there are higher or more restrictive covenants around underlying liquidity reserves for borrowers. And so that is slowing some of the activity. But overall, I would say, CMBS has been fairly moderate or modest in terms of new issuance, just as the market has begun to stabilize. So we're not seeing a significant it's not really coming from a competitive environment change. It's really just the overall availability of lending liquidity.",3.0181818,0.832
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,61,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So we believe our liquidity is a sound position to maintain liquidity includes our cash balances, and we may increase that slightly over time, but you're not going to see us preemptively draw down significantly under our revolvers. We have a very strong bank group. We feel confident that they will be there for us. And we don't think it's prudent to go ahead and draw down at this time.

CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,62,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We've gotten through that, and we typically see cash build through the rest of the year. So we'll continue to manage our cash flows with a very significant focus on working capital. We had a really good quarter from overall working capital trends, and that was really as a result of our leadership team and our management being highly focused on that. We're working through some additional process and system enhancements to make that more structured and systematic. And so I think we're in a great position from an overall liquidity standpoint and don't see any need to increase our cash position at this time.",0.2239468,0.927
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,66,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So again, we're not giving quantitative guidance, but I can tell you qualitatively, we are highly focused on receivables. We're focused on managing working capital closely. We recognize that, that is certainly a key component of getting through this uncertain time. And so our finance organization and our business leadership are partnering together to make sure that, that level of focus and importance is being placed on that.",0.2066519,0.922
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,70,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So we have spent an incredible amount of time on our loan loss reserve position. We feel very good about where we are. That is certainly something that will grow over time as our loan book increases. We have a very solid base of loans that we currently have in that portion of our overall portfolio. They have a strong debt service coverage ratio of about 1.9. We have a strong loan-to-value of about 65%. So we feel very good about where we are from a reserve perspective. I think if you go back to the GFC and assume the default levels that occurred then, we have a reserve that would be positioned in excess of what the losses would accumulate to be at the GFC level. So we feel very good about where we are. From an overall perspective, we've also seen very limited our requests for forbearance, we've seen less than 1% of what could be required to fund request to be funded so far. So again, I think we feel very good about where we are and that the quality of the loan book that we're currently sitting with today is in a solid position.",1.6190687,0.942
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,72,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. It was a portion of the contract. It wasn't the full relationship. It was a retail client, and it was one that was using our FacilitySource platform. So we are very focused on making sure that we continue to invest in facility sources to make sure that we have the appropriate technology platform and other components of the on-demand model positioned to serve the needs of all of our clients. I think this was just a very unique case. Again, this has not happened previously, where there may have just been some disconnect in terms of what our client wanted, and how it was executed. And so we're taking this time, particularly given the slower environment as it relates to onboarding clients to really focus on improving processes and making sure we're making those investments to really come out of this in a stronger position.",0.3747228,0.941
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,74,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes. Jade, this is Bob. Our expense for Hana last year was around $40 million. I believe this year, we're going to bring that down some because we've slowed the rate upon which we're adding new Hanas. We thought we'd get to 20 this year, we'll probably get to 10. In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens.",0.0915306,0.966

They just they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation.",0.0539738,0.9
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,78,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So, we're still assessing the overall pipeline. So, I would say, post Q1, I can't speak to the specific percentage that have been canceled because some may just be on hold. But overall, in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had about a 40% decline in overall transaction revenue. In across our leasing and sales business. Across the rest of the world because we do have a highly diversified footprint, EMEA and APAC, some markets are coming back online. So North Asia is seeing strength, whereas we certainly saw some softness to not at such an extreme extent as the U.S., but a softer environment in Continental Europe and the U.K. So I would just say it's a bit of a mixed bag outside of the U.S., but we certainly saw a significant reduction on the transactional side in the U.S. and really, it's hard to tell how many of them are truly canceled because many clients at this point are still contemplating what their move is going to be once they see greater transparency around how the economy and they are coming out of the COVID situation.",0.0784922,0.928
CBRE-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,80,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Well, again, it goes back to the probability of loss associated with the overall transaction. So, when we look at the loan loss, we have assessed our view on the overall default rates, the quality of the portfolio and our forecast in terms of underlying growth and the underlying growth of the property NOIs based on what is sitting in the loan portfolio at this time. So, because, as I said before, we have about a 1.9 DSR DSCR coverage ratio for the loans that are in that portfolio as well as a very low loan-to-value. We feel very good about the underwriting standards and the quality that sits in those portfolios today. And so we feel very good about where we are relative to our position.",0.7197339,0.831

During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7% respectively driven by constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improved both our cost structure and operational agility. Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring.

As you have seen, we ended 2020 on a high note with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic's unique effects on the office market.",0.0688616,0.94
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,9,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across four key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multi-family. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management, have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us, but our presence in Asia is robust and growing and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year. Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased four or more services in 2020, up from less than a quarter a decade ago.",0.0790717,0.867
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,10,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Our broad diversification across these four key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak to trough decline and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years. We are exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds.",0.0770926,0.494
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,11,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"We have built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which nevertheless expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles.",0.0952638,0.951

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,14,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8% respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which in combination grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter.",0.5982262,0.877
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,15,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Global leasing revenue declined about 28%, as occupiers around the world continue to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the UK, which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The UK again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We are also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels. The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multi-family transactional activity.",0.1982262,0.977
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,16,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific.",0.2474501,0.933
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,17,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together, declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes.",0.0039911,0.625

Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base.",0.4922395,0.765

We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and healthcare assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020.",0.5228381,0.954
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,20,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea. Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings. Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity.",0.4802661,0.987
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,21,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 11, we have ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth, while preserving strong profitability. We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity.",0.3166297,0.987
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,22,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 12, while considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturn due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multi-family transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits for the full year 2021.",0.2155211,0.889
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,23,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic's first month. Across the rest of advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with property management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments.",0.4013304,0.681

The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across project management and facilities management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double-digits by year end.

In investment management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020.

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,28,Remarks,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to Slide 13, our track record over the last decade and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth about a minimum low double-digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jumpstart our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities.",0.1148559,0.982

We are making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in late January. We have also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than two-thirds by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations, while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services.

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,37,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Steve. This gets back to the notion of us operating in a huge industry and having flexibility across four dimensions to adjust where we allocate our capital and focus the energies of our management team. So to repeat those four dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, etcetera. It's line of business, for instance, leasing versus project management versus facilities management. It's geographic spread and of course, it's client type. We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID and the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We have got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we will be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those four dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient. And Leah can talk to you more about that. But we have really doubled down in thinking that way as it relates to our balance sheet and using the $4 billion of capacity we have. Leah, you want to add to that?",0.0385809,0.953
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,38,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"No, I would just add, Steve, that from my perspective, this is really about ensuring that we are seeking to achieve the best total return from the investments that we make. And as we think about that, we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment strategy along the lines of ensuring that the returns that we seek are at or better than those presented by simply buying our stock back. So, ensuring that we are investing in areas where we will accelerate growth for the business. And as Bob just outlined, that is certainly aligned around our four dimensions of diversification as well as areas of secular tailwinds.",2.664745,0.907
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,39,Question,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Okay. And then I guess the second question sort of maybe piggybacks on that last statement just about the capital deployment, because I think you said in your comments that you would also look to maybe reinstitute a more programmatic share buyback, but I know you didn't buyback stock in the fourth quarter. So, just given the surge in the stock price, but obviously, earnings are clearly trending in the right direction. I guess how are you weighing the investment opportunities versus kind of the share buyback?",0.0274945,0.844
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,40,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Absolutely. We have a programmatic program. We have about $350 million remaining under our existing authorization. We will resume programmatic repurchases in the first quarter subject to meeting our valuation targets. And we look at that as the fact that we are currently in a net cash position and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue both our M&A pipeline as well as begin returning capital back to shareholders through our share repurchase program. So, we feel we are in a very good position to be able to do that today. And given our view on the long-term growth of our business, we believe that it's an appropriate time to do so.",3.1534368,0.791
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,44,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes, Tony, we will only say with regard to Industrious' financials that we expect that acquisition to be accretive this year, not in a major way and then grow from there. But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we have been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model that means that they provide flex space as a service - as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service that they beat us. They topped us. They were the one-off operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there will be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. So, we think that strategically Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years, because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They are going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They are going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters, so their people cannot have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So, we think they were the perfect partner for us and we love where we have ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation.",0.0107048,0.226
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,46,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes. Tony, it's a capital-light model. They put in - it will provide them with some capital, but they are not spending a lot to expand that business. They are not taking on long-term leases. They are not putting them most of the tenant finish. So, they have the capacity to expand that business. We feel very good about that.",0.057707,0.226
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,48,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes. Let me remind you how we think about M&A. We start with - and by the way, M&A and investments that we make, for instance, the Industrious investment, which clearly wasn't M&A. We, first and foremost, think about improving our ability to serve our clients, bringing something to the table that we didn't have before because at the core of our strategy is delivering outcomes to our clients they couldn't get elsewhere. We look across our business, all three segments. So advisory, GWS or outsourcing and REI, and we look for places where we can buy businesses to fill out our capability set. Of course, we're not going to do deals that don't make sense that don't achieve the hurdle rates we establish, so on and so forth. Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where we go. You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we are a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all three sectors. And I am going to highlight one that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the UK. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we're using our presence there to - and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the UK and Europe and very consistent with the model. That will be more of an organic expansion. But we think there is going to be opportunities across all three of our segments, some infill and some larger.",0.063914,0.751

And then last question maybe for Leah, I don't know if you explicitly mentioned margins - EBITDA margins for 2021. I may have missed it. But it seems like from all the brackets you've provided on the business lines and so forth, it's pointing to margins being higher in '21 versus 2019 and 2020 full year numbers.

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,54,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. I'm going to make a broad comment on that, Rick, and then I'm going to let Leah comment more specifically. But to get to that double-digit average growth rate between now and 2025, that threshold will be dominated by organic growth. It will include some capital investment in our REI businesses, co-investment, etcetera, and some M&A. But there is other capacity available beyond that, and I'm going to let Leah speak about that.",0.0789357,0.94
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,55,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks Bob. So the way we think about the base case is that we're effectively adding our organic growth from both the existing business we have and the benefit of a substantial portion of our free cash flow. We still have our investment capacity, given where our balance sheet sits today with a net cash position. And we think about leverage, the current position we are with respect to the cycle, we think we can operate around one turn leverage through deploying capital as it relates to M&A. And if we saw a strategic transaction, we would potentially take that to two turns, but would quickly de-lever from there back down. So that's how we're thinking about the base case, the opportunity for additional capital deployment as it relates to investments as well as capital return to shareholders.",0.3529933,0.727

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,61,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes. Jade, we always are open to M&A that would be adjacent to our business, not far adjacent but near adjacent to our business. And I'm going to highlight again that Telford multifamily deal in the UK 1.5 years ago. But for the most part, we want to stay within the things we do because we have so much headroom for growth in the areas that we're already good but could be better at. We think that's the preferred place to deploy our capital. We think that's where the highest odds of success are. But we will look at things that are adjacent. I think you remember 3 years or so ago, we did an - in our investment management business, we did an infrastructure investment acquisition that we're very happy with. And I think that gives us opportunity for expansion. But we try to stay within our footprint for the most part when we do M&A.",0.2459407,0.382

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,65,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"No, in our total development, $200 million roughly. So Jade, that is not a capital-intensive development model that we deploy. However, I will say that across our REI business, we generated such strong returns on our co-investments. For instance, in our development business over the last 8 years or so, over 30% compounded IRRs on capital invested. We will look to put a little more money into the development business. We will look to put a little more money into co-investments in our REI business where we've generated strong returns. But for the most part, when we buy services businesses that will be asset light, as Leah said in her prepared remarks, when you buy GWS or outsourcing businesses, you need some working capital to fund the growth, both of those individual client relationships, but we're mostly pretty asset-light. And I'm going to say it again, one of the things we like so much about investors, very asset-light.",0.1574686,0.226

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,67,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So in terms of Hana, we have invested approximately - I'll have to get you the exact number, Jade, but in terms of the current year, we had a loss of about $40 million related to Hana.

We serve some really good flex space operators out there, help them find space and help them fill their space. They will still be very anxious to have us do that. And of course, we're going to continue to do that with Industrious and look for ways to do some creative stuff on the services we provide to occupiers with that Industrious partnership. We don't think it will have a big impact on our broker's relationship with others. It's just the nature of the business. It's a very large opportunity.",0.179283,0.637
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,72,Question,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you very much. On the transaction outlook, I'm curious as to why you would only expect mid to high single-digit growth in transaction revenue. I assume that's a blend of what you're anticipating in leasing, which would probably be at the lower end or perhaps below that, and capital markets, which would probably be at the high end or above that range. Is that why you are saying mid to high single-digit growth?",0.1201774,0.794

I would also note that you mentioned capital markets, but the transactions is just leasing and sales. So we do expect sales to be above that level, and we do expect leasing to be below.

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,75,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, absolutely. So we had really two types of costs this year - or in 2020 related to our optimization of our cost structure. First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about $38 million on workforce optimization. We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positing us to be more agile going forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That's being offset in '21 by the resumption - or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that we did in 2020 related to cost management. And this is spread across all three of our segments. Advisory was the largest. We estimate about 60% of our cost takeout was from advisory, with about 30% in GWS and the rest in our REI and corporate functions.",0.086031,0.361

We do work of some nature for virtually all of the Fortune 500 companies in all of the comparably large companies around the world. But we only do most of the real estate work for a very small handful of those companies. And there is some we don't do any for at all. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, if you went back a few years, we - quarter of our clients, we were doing multiple services for, for more services. Now it's 90%. It's gone up dramatically. And that's generally a trend when we take on work for these clients. We get in the door. We prove to them we can save them money or we can execute for them better on some basis than they have been getting on their own or from a myriad of providers, and we tend to grow those relationships.

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,83,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yes. Well, we had a huge amount of - one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID is over and there is not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they are going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had two types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they are saying that's going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there is going to be big demand for what they do. They are not going to be the only ones. There is other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy.",0.0751136,0.88

CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,90,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. We're not - I'm not going to get too granular because we're not giving quantitative guidance for '21, but I would say a key part of our transformation initiative and the principle behind that was to ensure that we were reducing costs in certain areas, however, that we were - that would preserve our ability to maintain industry-leading margins as we invest into the opportunities and the secular tailwinds that we see presenting themselves as a result of coming out of COVID. So we believe that even with the investments that we're making, the cost takeout that we executed in 2020 will allow us to preserve those margins. So it's really across all three segments. We are investing across the business. It's across the key dimensions that Bob laid out. It's all in response to the intense strategy work that we took on throughout the course of the year. And we feel really good about how those investments are going to position us throughout '21 to really capture the long-term opportunities presented in the market today.",0.1853659,0.92
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,91,Question,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"And then clearly, property sale is very strong in industrial, data center multifamily throughout 2020. Are you seeing a falling though in other property types as there now appears to be some glimmer of hope for a reopening or is there a greater interest in our property types?",0.0931264,0.856
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,92,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We're certainly seeing a glimmer of hope. I think the vaccine news in late 2020 was certainly a catalyst for investors to begin to come back off the sidelines for investment property sales. However, I think industrial and multifamily continue to be the real winners in terms of asset classes or property types in the market today, but we are seeing liquidity around other asset classes and we will continue to monitor that in '21.",0.0776053,0.0
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,93,Question,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,And do you think that would be additive to the activity on the standard property types or do you think that would somewhat cannibalize that activity as capital moves to other property types?,0.2940133,0.422
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,98,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"We can, Patrick, and it's very much tied to that broad base of business we do across those four dimensions and the fact that we see an awful lot of opportunity out there when we do our M&A work to do business with companies that we can help and can help us, but they simply aren't the type of company for one reason or another that we should be buying in whole. So maybe it's a company that's super entrepreneur needs to have an ability to serve us and our competitors has a culture that's best independent, etcetera, etcetera; a brand that's best independent, but they can be really helpful to us, and we can be really helpful to them. When we contemplated doing the SPAC, that's what we had in mind. We would make an investment in those kind of companies. We would establish some kind of operating alliance with those type of companies, but we wouldn't buy them outright because of the reasons I just articulated. And we think that, that formula is going to work very well. We're seeing a bunch of companies that we think could be good candidates in the construction services arena, smart buildings, data centers, all kinds of things that serve buildings. We're quite confident we're going to find a good target for that SPAC, and there will be follow-on specs behind it. We're very differently situated than most SPAC sponsors. We have not really thought of as a financial sponsor. We're thought of as a strategic sponsor. And the way the SPAC is financially structured where our upside comes only when those - the company that we would quote de-SPAC grows in value speaks to our confidence that we can find a target partner and help them grow their business.",0.1232402,0.856
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,99,Question,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Great. That's helpful commentary. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, to what extent is existing facilities management clients reducing their office footprints posing a near-term headwind on GWS segment fee revenue?",0.0824834,0.978
CBRE-2020-Q4-2021-02-23,100,Answer,2021-02-23,4,2020,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So near-term, Patrick, that's not a concern. We certainly are staying close to our GWS clients. They are looking to us for our expertise around workplace design and solutions. What is it's really created is a pause in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will evolve over time. And so, it's not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It's more about a delay in our pipeline. And what's important to appreciate is that we have significant diversification across the clients that we serve within GWS. So we are not just serving their office footprint. We're also serving their data center needs. We are serving their for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility needs. And so there is a lot of other opportunity out there across other property types and through our client diversification where we see significant opportunities for growth as well. So given the overall market size of integrated outsourcing, we currently think we have about a mid-single-digit market share in a $1.6 trillion market, I think a $200 billion market of the total asset market, which is about $1.6 trillion, I think there is still tremendous opportunity to grow that business and ensure that we are doing it aligned with our clients' needs.",0.0221729,0.707

Probably the marketplace in general won't be quite as active as it was in 2018, but we expect to grow our business because we expect it takes some market share.

David, the kind of gestation period for a development deal takes it beyond the first year that you put it in process. And some are longer than others. You can have some warehouses that you can get through pretty quickly in a year, maybe a little over a year. Office buildings can take much longer. Multi-family can take much longer. And we're doing more and more core type product which, in general, takes a little longer, which is by the way very good news because it's generally less risky, generally you're able to finance it with more staying power.

CBRE-2018-Q4-2019-02-13,118,Answer,2019-02-13,4,2018,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"We think that co-working or flexible space, we think it's going to morph over time. So, it's more suites oriented, institutional occupier oriented than traditional co-working. We think it's going to grow. We think it's 1% to 2% of the global base of multitenant space today. We think that could grow to 5% to 10%. Obviously, you've read research reports by others that suggest it could go much higher than that. We've studied it very closely. We think it's very real. We think that - let's look at our big occupier clients. We know for sure that those occupier clients want to have a lot of the space that they are in the space they own. We know that they want to have a lot of the space they are in be space they lease, that's exclusively for them. But we also know that, on the margin, they like to be able to have a chunk of their space for employees that move around the world or employees that are part of a team that's just forming and maybe absorbed into something else later, things like that. They like the notion of flexible space. And so, we think this opportunity is real. We think it's going to grow.

The flow of capital information may have slowed a bit. There's plenty of bidders for anything good that comes to market. There's plenty of debt for anything good that comes to market. We've said we think the market will be a little less active. Well, the growth will be. I shouldn't say that. We think the growth in the market will be less in 2019 than 2018. We think it will be kind of a flattish market. But I wouldn't say we're seeing big trends and we expect to grow our capital markets in our sales business next year.",0.0873476,0.939

We study that all the time and ask the question with our management team, with our strategy team, with our board, should we go into adjacent areas. The choices we made for the time being are that we're going to into this experienced market with our Host offering more aggressively. We made the choice to go into the co-working or flexible space market with Hana. Obviously, in this last cycle, we escalated materially our participation in multifamily. We think that was a really good call. We have now a sizable multifamily development business. And we've always had a sizable multifamily trading and financing business.",0.0692214,0.612

We have mechanisms to ensure synergy between the two, but we're going to have much more focus. And if you were ask Mike Lafitte, the global head of our advisory business, what he's going to do, we have 12 divisional presidents around the world in that advisory business, and one of the things he's going to ask them to focus on in each major market is understanding whether or not we're the leader in occupier leasing, we're the leader in agency leasing, whether we're the leader in capital markets and financing, and understand that deeply and, to the extent, we aren't go after.

When you look at our leasing activity and you look at the leasing activity of our good competitors, it's much bigger than just flexible workspace. We had a question a minute ago why only 3% when the market absorption is 20%? Well, first of all, that's just office space, right? We do a lot of leasing, obviously, in the industrial space.

Most big occupiers around the world, the majority of their leasing will still be in spaces that are not co-working spaces.

All three regions generated leasing revenue above Q3 2019 peak levels, up 4% in the Americas, 20% in EMIA and 11% in APAC. Office demand in the U.S. continues to trail pre-pandemic levels.

All regions exceeded their pre-pandemic peaks with global property sales up 93% from Q3 2020 and 27% from the Q3 2019 peak. Like in leasing, U.S. office sales activity saw significant improvement coming in just 16% below Q3 2019 levels versus 31% in Q2, and improved investment market also helped generate strong growth and commercial mortgage origination. Revenue rose 41%, from Q3 2020 and 11% from the Q3 2019 peak. Both the government agencies and private lenders were noticeably more active in Q3. We expect the agency's higher lending caps for 2022 coupled with a healthy appetite from private lenders and the attractive yields available from real estate debt to provide a supportive backdrop heading into next year.",0.5660052,0.98

We are optimistic about the future growth trajectory of GWS. Our new business pipeline is growing, and remains well diversified with representation from financial services, industrial life sciences and technology clients.

Importantly, our in-process portfolio set another new high this quarter, rising to $16.8 billion, largely driven by multifamily activity. Investment management benefited from a record level of asset management fees as well as higher incentive acquisition and disposition fees, compared with Q3 2020, revenue rose 35% to $135 million, while operating profit increased 68% to $49 million.

We also anticipate stronger incremental margin expansion than we previously forecast due to the more robust revenue growth. The Q4 net margin should be around the 22.7% achieved in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect the benefit of more revenue from high margin business lines will likely be offset by increased discretionary spending to drive growth and by lower OMSR gains compared with Q4 2020.",0.7506471,0.936

For calendar year 2021, Turner & Townsend is expected to generate roughly $1 billion in net revenue at the current spot rate at a similar operating profit margin to their prior fiscal year.

We now expect this business lines revenue to rise in the low to mid-teens range and its operating profit to increase by at least 30% versus 2020. This includes some incremental OpEx investments slated for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect global development operating profits to roughly triple the $122 million generated in 2019.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow generation reached a company record at over $1.9 billion. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of 0.3 turns and nearly $6 billion of liquidity.

So I think I'll comment overall on our business, we feel very comfortable that we're well positioned to weather inflationary pressures across our business. I did mention in my remarks that we see a natural hedge within our GWS contracts overall and then we also see a natural hedge in other parts of our business with property management, for example.

Given that inflation tends to only happen when the economy is expanding, so across all those businesses, we feel very comfortable that we can weather the inflationary environment.

CBRE-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,57,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Well, that's a complex question, Steve. The industrious investment, we believe is a bit of a hedge against -- not even a bit a significant hedge against what we've said now for some time is that we expect there to be some downward pressure on the office product type relative to where it has been historically. But we've studied this flex dynamic over and over and over and spent a huge amount of time with our occupier clients. And the general view is that they expect flex space to be a bigger portion of their office space used going forward than it has been historically and landlords are expected to be a fixture in their buildings in general going forward.",0.094769,0.829
CBRE-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,58,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"So we think the future for industrious is quite bright. We voted with our pocketbook as they stay when we invested in that business and we're prepared to make an incremental investments to support their growth. We're quite bullish about what might happen with industrious. As it relates to the Office product type in general, I think our company and our own plans about what to do with our people is a bit of a proxy for what's going on in the marketplace. There's uncertainty we had thought we would have a significant return to the office kind of inflection point after Labor Day, because people were more and more aimed at getting their teams back into the office for all the reasons we know, collaboration, culture et cetera. When the Delta variant came, it pushed that back, we now think that inflection point is probably going to be the first of the year. And we think people will come back to the office in the same way they would have come back to the office had the Delta variant not occurred. And our view that we've articulated for the past several quarters is, that's going to be something like 80%, 85%, of where it was before. But again, we're all trying to figure out what the future of office space is going to be. But we believe what we've really seen is a delay from Labor Day to the first of the year.",0.0277965,0.637

We've generated a record amount of free cash flow over the last 12 months. So we're very happy with our balance sheet position and our free cash flow generation. And we're really taking the time to reassess what our capital allocation strategy is and how we're going to return cash to shareholders. And so we think we're in a really strong position, we're still very focused on looking for avenues to invest in our company, both organically and through M&A where we can drive growth and resiliency.

They are causing some challenges in terms of staffing, we and our clients are like everybody else. There's a real war for talent and it's impacting the things we do. What you're seeing on the rebuild of the pipeline and slightly relative downward pressure we've seen on the growth trajectory of the enterprise portion of our outsourcing business is that people have found it difficult to make decisions not knowing what's going to go on with office space. And they found it difficult to make decisions because they aren't in the office together coordinating all the things you need to coordinate to make massive commitments, the way outsourcing contracts require you to make to move forward at the pace we're moving forward before. These commitments that these occupiers are making on these outsourcing contracts can be multi-billion-dollar commitments over years.

And that's particularly true with industrial assets with life sciences, assets, with multifamily assets and even with office assets that are high quality and have the right tendency.

Sulentic,CEO and President,"We don't think competition is intensifying; it's probably backed up a little bit in a positive sense over the last year. Well, let me rephrase that it certainly has backed up a little bit in a positive sense. We are having meeting with a lot of success in recruiting around the world and the reason we're meeting with a lot of success is because producers realize they can come to our company and through a combination of our footprint, the client base we have, the range of services we have, they can leverage to land transactional business.

If it's -- if interest rates spike a little bit we don't think it'll have much of an impact at all. If they spike more, then people go to the sidelines to wait and see what happens.

CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,5,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Kristyn Farahmand,,"Now please turn to Slide 4 which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion partially driven by a strong rebound in property build and to a lesser extent leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effect. The quarter also saw a tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiative which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million surpassing Q2 2019 total by 53%. Overall adjusted EPS grew 291% to 136 while GAAP EPS rose 437% to 130. Compared with Q2 2019 these metrics were up 68% and 98% respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a charitable contribution to COVID relief effort. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter. In fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed Q2 2019 levels as a testament to the resiliency of our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring home .",0.0304038,0.978

CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,7,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Thanks Kristyn and good morning everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across four dimensions; asset type, business line, client type, and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend. Overall Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all three business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this two-year period due to our disciplined expense management along with the benefits of diversification. Thoughtful investments shaped by a well-developed strategy will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type, and geography.",0.1261638,0.987
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,8,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerged from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly failed companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE. You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the Flex space arena and again this month with our SPACs sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project, program, and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long term growth profiles. Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the four dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our client's carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now. Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere. And they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.",0.1302568,0.99
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,9,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business. The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli, the Global Group President roles, represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy.",0.1296271,0.96
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,10,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact based decisions as we guide the company's growth. Vikram is the first senior executives from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. in the senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions.",0.1306167,0.981

I want to thank Leah for her vision and initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing finance through the worst of the COVID 19 crisis, and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success. With that I'll turn the call over to Emma.",0.1148293,0.735
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,12,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records, rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed their previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18% respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued America's office leasing. Overall, leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA, and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing, with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.",0.9163072,0.961
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,13,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"As expected, property sales improved markedly, with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA, APAC property sales revenue was 158%, 132%, and 151% respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 level, with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019. The macroeconomic backdrop is supported by real estate investments and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also help to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw a particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization. Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially to over 294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans, brokered and originated despite loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Evaluating revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S. with evaluation revenue increase nearly 47%. Finally, property management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly while Americas lagged due to a previous decision to exit some low margin contracts.",0.9106989,0.985
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,14,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Moving to Slide 9, Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and facilities management up 10% driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments, as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation. Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mixed shift to higher margin work, and the impact of last year of transformation initiatives, which more than offset increased medical expenses. Even accounting for about 17 million of transitory COVID related expenses in last year Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified, with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics, and technology companies along with new data center activities.",0.6721311,0.991
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,15,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment generated over 152 million of segment operating profits surpassing its previous quarterly high by 38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly 120 million was fueled by a large office property sale that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenant fees. Importantly, our pipeline and in process portfolio both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee based office and industrial work for blue chip occupier clients.",0.8999137,0.961
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,16,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Investment management revenue grew 35% to 139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest, and favorable FX translation. Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%. Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to 9 million. We expect the further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious. And all Hana sites except for four legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious stake, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes will be reflected in advisory.",1.0120794,0.983
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,17,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak. We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill. As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start where we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months, that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we have started to see some U.S. based companies modestly delay return to office space, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter-to-date.",1.0897325,0.717
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,18,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Across the rest of our advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double digit range versus the high single digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations. Moving to GWS, we are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profits while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around a high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations. Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half, and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction.",1.0103538,0.86
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,19,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Looking at REI, we expect this segment to nearly double 2020s record high profitability. In investment management we expect revenue to surpass [Audio interrupted] and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the 140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more than double versus 2020, and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of 122 million. They are developing product in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization. This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.",0.3425367,0.978
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,20,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019 even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses, as compared to that year. The return of high margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives, and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook. Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peaks of $3.71 to have wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half our earnings in the second half, but given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.",0.8278689,0.599
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,21,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Moving to Slide 12, over the last year we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships, and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transactions, while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares. Still net leverage remains modest at 0.2 times pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have a significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four pronged investment approach, convincing of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions, and building our own resources and capabilities. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come.",1.1307161,0.97
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,22,Remarks,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspiration we outlined in February, at least low double digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025, absent a downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation. With that operator please open the line for questions.",0.2428818,0.772
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,25,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"It's that the split will be a little bit more even. So the first half comp versus 2020 obviously is much easier than the second half. We are expecting a shift in our earnings to be more weighted, to move more towards the first half, so we still expect the majority of it to be in the second half.",0.4710958,0.747
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,27,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Tony, I would say it's both. Capital markets is doing quite well. There is a huge amount of capital interested in commercial real estate, obviously aimed at certain asset classes, for instance, anything related to industrial distribution, multifamily data centers. There is a lot of capital aimed at those assets, lot of trading going on and obviously we're big in those arenas. So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's a real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID and as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now, as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made, but we're -- I would say we can be certain about two things, we probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID, but we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right. The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID.",0.0972878,0.361
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,29,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,So office leasing revenue came down to 47% of our total leasing revenues globally and 2020 it was 54%. So it came down 7%.,0.9335634,0.875
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,31,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Yeah, so historically Turner & Townsend has shown very consistent mid-teens growth, both to net revenue and EBITDA. And through 2021, you probably saw their revenue was pretty flat. They only dropped 3% and EBITDA was up significantly. So going forward, we're expecting them to continue to hit those mid double digit revenue, mid-teens revenue and EBITDA but I will say that for 2022, we are expecting EBITDA to be in line with 2021 as costs come back in post COVID, even as revenue increases.",0.9482312,0.402
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,33,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"No, we have done a few intel acquisitions for Industrious. We have not revalued that investment because it was the reason we expect to do that later that year. So you won't see any impact from Industrious this year.",0.677308,0.836
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,37,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"That business has not been cyclical. As Emma said, they'd been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on, and one of the things Steve that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds. So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So, the decision making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, they're about what their long-term needs are. So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operated at different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass throughs we do. For instance, one thing they don't do is principal contracting which we do which of course has big pass throughs. But they're doing some massive projects around the world. To give you an example, they're doing a hydro project in New South Wales in Australia. That will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hybrid listed so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India, that will go on for years and years and years. My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management, then the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high margin company and they are real grower.",0.148383,0.537
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,39,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Oh yeah, big complex projects like that last for years and years. I'll give you another example, they're working on a $6 billion redevelopment at the Toronto airport. Any of us that have gone to airports and seen these projects know they just, they go on for a long time. So yes, those contracts are very long-term.",0.1356992,0.743
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,41,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Yeah. So we still have a very strong M&A pipeline. I think we are going to look to do more deals like Turner & Townsend, we will also continue to do our programmatic M&A through in sell. But I think you'll see a mix of both and our real focus is on finding targets that can really help push our strategy forward, our diversification strategy across asset types, business lines, client types, and geographies that Bob has talked about with all of you many times.

Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yeah Jade, there was some pent up demand that came through in the marketplace, but when you ask about capital markets in the real commercial real estate sector, you have to look at the alternative places capital can go. And as you know, there is a lot of capital around the world and prices are high in most asset classes, stocks, etcetera. And so real estate has proven to be a much better asset class over the last decade and there were certain portions, certain asset classes within real estate that appear to be particularly strong. And we've talked about them over and over multi-family, data centers, anything industrial, anything by the way in the office arena that are new high quality buildings with great tenants, especially tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital out there in general, a considerable portion of it that's concluded that commercial real estate is a good place to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely well with lots of headway to continue to perform well. And so, there was a little pent-up demand coming through, but our view is that this is going to sustain for years.",0.1077677,0.0

We have some higher margin revenue coming on and then we do have some costs that are one-time in nature and we'll come back. But we think the majority of that margin is sustainable.,0.0962036,0.361
CBRE-2021-Q2-2021-07-29,53,Answer,2021-07-29,2,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Yeah Tony, I'll talk about that. And it's very relevant to this structure we put in place by the way with Turner & Townsend. So, the Trammell Crow company model generally works the following way. When we generate earnings, there's two levels of compensation, commitment that go to our developers and those who manage our development business and that totals around 40% of the total profit that then gets -- the other 60% goes into our earnings. That's the way that works. So when you look at this Turner & Townsend model that we've now just executed on or we will close on later this year, very, very similar structure. One of the reasons we're so excited, Trammell Crow company has thrived subject to this structure. Within Turner & Townsend would thrive subject to the structure, very motivational to the professionals in the business, very aligning between the company and the professionals in the business. And you've seen the results, you've seen our profits now in Trammell Crow Company are over six times what they were pre-financial crisis when we bought that business.",0.1407367,0.932

And then we have various kinds of structures, but for the most part, if you look at the total project profit that comes out of a deal, maybe 30% of it comes to us sometimes more than that.

We made strategic investments in Turner & Townsend and Industrious and saw significant gains from strategic noncore investments made through our SPAC and in venture capital funds. Due to our controlling interest that results from our 60% ownership stake in Turner & Townsend, we fully consolidate Turner & Townsend's financials, including their balance sheet.

Core adjusted EPS excludes the impact of strategic noncore, noncontrolling investments that are not attributable to a business segment. These had an immaterial impact prior to 2021. These investments are a small part of our portfolio, but there is likely to be considerable volatility in their fair values, particularly for Altus Power, the largest of our investments now trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

We believe this incremental transparency will help investors assess the level of corporate overhead and the performance of these noncore investments.

As you've seen, we had a strong finish to 2021 significantly outperforming both Q4 2020 and the pre-pandemic peak in Q4 2019. This capped an outstanding year for CBRE with all key financial benchmarks reaching new all-time highs for the company. We certainly benefited from a supportive macro environment in 2021. Beyond that, our strong financial performance is the product of our long-standing work to strengthen our balance sheet and improve the resiliency of our income statement as well as our successful efforts over the past several years to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies.

The most recent example is the agreement to acquire a $4.9 billion portfolio of U.S. and European logistics assets from Hillwood. Our balance sheet provided a backstop proportions of this portfolio, which enabled our team to move quickly to secure a highly desirable set of assets.

This is up from the low double-digit growth expectation we set a year ago. The average annual growth rate is expected to be in the low double digits for the prospective period from 2021 to 2025.

Like Q3, I'll include compares with Q4 2019 for their transactional business lines to provide insight into our performance from peak levels. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 24% compared to Q4 2020 and 20% over Q4 2019 led by rebounding sales and lease revenue.

Globally, sales revenue jumped over 73% from Q4 2020 and 45% from Q4 2019. The U.S. led the recovery among our major markets with 89% sales revenue growth compared to the prior year quarter.

U.S. industrial sales revenue more than doubled from Q4 2019, while U.S. multifamily sales nearly doubled over the same period. Office continues to gradually improve back towards pre-pandemic levels. And our U.S. office sales revenue was around 14% shy of Q4 2019, an improvement from steeper declines in the prior quarters.",0.9676445,0.936

EMEA leasing revenue grew 25% on Q4 2019, and the Americas was up 13%, while APAC grew 7%. Industrial leasing surged around 60% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupier demand for distribution space remains strong. Like in sales, office leasing also continued to recover with global office leasing nearly flat versus Q4 2019. EMEA and APAC office leasing rose around 7% and 11%, respectively, compared to Q4 2019.

Our loan servicing portfolio grew 23% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially to nearly $330 billion, primarily driven by private capital sources. Our multifamily portfolio, comprising nearly half of the total, grew about 14% versus Q4 2020. Our alternative asset type portfolio, which includes agriculture, health care, hotels and others, rose over 70% and now comprises approximately 19% of our total servicing portfolio.

This includes about $175 million in net revenue from the Turner & Townsend transaction, which closed on November 1 and was in line with our previous expectations. We are extremely excited about the growth trajectory for this business. Project management is a fragmented market, estimated to be over $100 billion with strong secular growth tailwinds, particularly within infrastructure. This transaction helps to bolster the nascent infrastructure capabilities within our existing businesses.

Strong growth in project management was driven by continued recovery from the pandemic-constrained environment. Facilities Management revenue increased nearly 6%, and net revenue rose over 10% supported by growth from local clients.

This was driven by increasing activity in our U.K. multifamily development business, which is continuing to recover from COVID-related challenges. Investment Management revenue was relatively flat versus Q4 2020 at about $150 million due to lower carried interest revenue, which can be volatile. Excluding carried interest revenue, Investment Management revenue grew 19%, driven by strong asset management fee growth. AUM rose to a new record of nearly $142 billion with more than 80% invested in assets other than office. Industrial comprises the largest component, in line with our strategic vision to position the company to benefit from this sector's strong secular tailwinds.",0.1151855,0.971

Giamartino,Global CFO,"Development operating profit of $122 million was affected by a $29 million increase in the reserve we had previously taken on a U.K. construction project that faced challenges that were exacerbated by the pandemic. We believe we have fully reserved for this project and don't expect it to result in further adverse financial impacts. Putting aside this reserve increase, development operating profit would have been over $150 million for the quarter and about $380 million for the year, surpassing our previous expectations. This was driven by the conversion of our average in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of over 2.1% over the trailing 12-month period, a level well above our historical norm of between 1% and 2% with most years around the midpoint.",0.5496117,0.891

This is largely driven by higher incentive compensation as performance materially exceeded initial 2021 expectations and our investments in key corporate functions to help support our larger business.

This includes a benefit of $0.36 from a gain in our SPAC investment and another $0.03 from mark-to-market adjustments on our Altus Power and VC investments. Excluding these noncash gains, core adjusted EPS rose 24% to $1.80. Excluding only the SPAC deconsolidation gain, which is consistent with how we've reported our results in previous quarters, adjusted EPS rose over 26% to $1.83.",0.3166523,0.925
CBRE-2021-Q4-2022-02-24,40,Remarks,2022-02-24,4,2021,Emma E. Giamartino,Global CFO,"Robust underlying earnings growth reflects the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA as well as lower net interest expense. These were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, mainly related to elevated prepayments of government agency-related loans, which triggered higher OMSR amortization. Our results also include noncash interest expense related to deferred purchase consideration for our remaining Turner & Townsend payments and an increase in our effective adjusted tax rate to 23.9%. The nonrecurring reserve increase in the U.K. multifamily development business lowered earnings by approximately $0.07.

In support of this, we commenced our fifth consecutive quarter of repurchases in Q1 2022. We intend to continue repurchases throughout this year, assuming the return remains attractive and we have capacity given our evolving M&A pipeline.

CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,61,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, and good morning. My first question is, I didn't catch all of Kristyn's opening comments. And I think there was some mention about flat EPS maybe year-over-year, because of some changes in the impact there. Can you touch on that again? I just want to make sure I understand the baseline and what changed?",0.0243902,0.859
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,62,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. Anthony, it's Leah. Kristyn has just outline. There were some unique items in Q1 from last year, as well as this year. The key drivers are really an impairment that we had last year for GAAP EPS. And then, in the first quarter, we did have an accounting change in global investors related to our fair value accounting around our co-investment balances. We also had venture capital gains that was one time in nature in the first quarter this year. And so those items have basically offset each other.",0.4558758,0.769
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,63,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Okay. Does the change in the valuation items in REI that you did in the first quarter. Does that change how we should think about the profits of that business just on a run rate basis? Like, does that add to the 2020, 2021 full year?",0.1055432,0.527
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,64,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"It is. It was something that we expected. It was an anticipated accounting change when we came into the year that we were going to implement in Q1. And it is something that will actually reduce the volatility of that earnings stream within our investment management business going forward. We're basically going to be marketing to market our unlisted co-investment balances. And therefore, instead of having one large gain at the end of the period costs, you're going to see us mark that to market every quarter.",0.6953437,0.309
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,65,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Okay. And so, is there a way to frame that for the full year 2021 at this point? Or you've got it fully marked as of the first quarter and it's just from here, you'll make changes?",0.6159645,0.0
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,66,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"That's exactly right. From here, we'll make changes fully marked.",0.1658537,0.349
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,67,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Okay, understand. Then same question. Last year, you outlined a lot of different cost saves. And now you change some of the presentation here. Is there a way to put that into the framework, understand where you are on that right now? What was achieved in the first quarter? And what's left to see over the remainder of the year?",0.113082,0.743
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,68,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Absolutely. I would say in terms of how we're presenting the information. There's not a real material shift in terms of where the benefits of the cost management actions are flowing through the business. The advisory segment continues to be the area where we've made the lion share of the overall cost reduction. So that's 60% of our cost actions are benefiting advisory. Next to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%. And then the rest is between REI and our corporate segments. In terms of this first quarter though, on a net basis, I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings. Now we do have some temporary costs coming back like compensation that's performance based, and accrued based on that.",0.0084257,0.84
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,69,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We had about $24 million of benefit and advisory on a net basis, and about $14 million of benefit in GWS with the rest, basically, about a million or so across REI and corporate. So again, the vast majority of the overall benefit in Q1 was an advisory and our reporting segment, modifications haven't really altered the mix of where that's going to impact the business going forward.",0.2461197,0.226
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,70,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,Okay. So that's about $40 million that you achieved in the first quarter. What should we expect over the balance of the year?,0.2461197,0.178
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,71,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. So in terms of for the full year, we think there will be a little over $110 million of savings. And this is all on a net basis. So when you close that up, we have taken out about just shy of $90 million in the first quarter and right around $250 million of incremental costs year-over-year on a runway basis.",0.0115299,0.772
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,72,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Got it. Okay. And then just moving more towards the business side of things. As you will get through the strength and life sciences, data centers, industrial that stuff, can the growth in those areas, longer term offset any diminution in office?",0.2381375,0.974
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,73,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We do expect that the diversification not just across asset types, but across our geographies will also be important. So as we think about just surging demand for warehouse, industrial distribution, life sciences, as well as digital infrastructure, those are certainly helping to mitigate the acute declines that we're seeing across office. So, I do think that that is a key part of the overall story for CBRE. And the fact that we have positioned ourselves to be aligned with those very important areas of demand in the market today. And then also, given the fact that APAC was early on in terms of the impacts related to COVID, we are seeing the regions of the world that has kind of come through this and manage through COVID quite well or effectively, or we're early on the onset of COVID. Those are really back in terms of strong performance. And we're starting to see the recovery take shape in places like the U.K., Continental Europe and U.S.",0.4137472,0.226
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,75,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Anthony, this is Bob. We have a substantial M&A pipeline and pipeline of alternatives or investment opportunities that we would characterize more as sponsorship type opportunities where we could invest in a company and then help that company be more successful and it would be on its own. We've done a lot of strategy work to determine the areas of our business that we want to make investments in because we think they will benefit in a secular way. Leah had just outlined a bunch of that for you. So you should expect to see us make some very nice investments over the coming months, that would be secondarily favored, and CBRE would be able to help those investments perform well. I will say that we're going to be very careful. We're not going to be feeling pressure to push money out the door just because we have it. We do think that there will be opportunities.",0.0321594,0.612
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,80,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you very much. I was wondering if on a per share basis, there's any way to quantify what you might consider unusual items. Was it just the REI accounting change of perhaps around $0.05 per share or were there additional items?",0.3756098,0.273
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,81,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"So Jade, in terms of the venture capital and the REI accounting change, those, as well as some prior period items, I would say, you got about $0.06 each related to the VC and the accounting change. And then we did have -- in the prior year period, we didn't have that impairment related to the COVID impacts across parts of our business. So that was reflected in the prior period.",0.004878,0.382
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,82,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"And just looking at the changes to definition of net revenue, would fee revenue growth have been similar around four -- down 4.4% on a local currency basis for the first quarter?",0.7977827,0.494
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,83,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,We've provided a bridge for you in terms of the overall fee to net basis. It was pretty much in line. There wasn't a major swing there.,0.5929047,0.866
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,84,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks. In terms of the GSE multifamily volumes, they've surged so far this year, up I believe over 50%. And I think you also pointed out the margin benefit from the MSR gain. Have you seen any slowdown in GSEs multifamily originations. Your rates were lower early in the year. And I think the mix of refi transactions was above the normal rate. So are you expecting the volume growth in that business to slow?",0.3747228,0.886
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,85,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Well, that's really driven, again, by market conditions. So if you look at our margin performance for the year, yes, OMSR certainly helps. But even if you back out OMSRs just before I get into the volumes on the GSEs, I think it's important to note that we actually saw margin expansion ex OMSRs. So that's really important. As it relates to the GSEs, their caps are coming down this year. So we may see some attenuation in terms of overall liquidity in that market. But again, their mandate is liquidity. So we'll see how they respond to the overall market conditions.",0.3237251,0.819
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,86,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"The benefit to our business, though, is about the mix of where we're seeing that activity come from. And in the quarter, we did have more of a volume coming from Fannie as opposed to Freddie and that that certainly helps from a margin perspective, given the fact that we do have a risk share there on the Fannie side. So overall, it'll really depend, unfortunately, Jade with respect to how that that activity comes in, and we don't actually influence, that it's really a market driven outcome.",0.968071,0.632
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,88,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Jade, we have paid attention to that. And it is -- this is not the first time its arisen. So first of all, it's not certain that will happen. But we're watching it closely. I think we have to put in perspective, what part of our business that impacts so it impacts the sales businesses, the real estate asset sales business here in the U.S. And we think it impacts about 10% of the U.S. sales activity across markets, that's not a CBRE comment. So that's the portion of our business that might be impacted. Our view is that if it were to happen, and not be retroactive for the foreseeable future, it would be a plus for transaction volumes, because people would be in the market trying to get deals done. In the longer run, given the magnitude of it relative to our whole business and the area to which it's contained geographically and line of business wise, we think it will not have a material impact on our earnings prospects currently, or in the longer term as we've laid them out for you.",0.0389511,0.649

And again, keeping in mind, we think of our business in those four dimensions that we talked about property type, line of business, client type and geography, we're scanning the horizon constantly for new opportunities. And we don't talk in advance of when we execute those new opportunities, Jade, what we might do. That's not an area that we're active in, though.",0.1379481,0.361
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,94,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"Not a lot new to our view. We are intensely engaged with occupiers here in the U.S. and around the world. We believe that office will never be quite what it was prior to the pandemic. But we also believe it will be very different than it is today. The 85% that we talked about before is kind of still what we believe. By the way, if you're paying close attention to the press, and what individual companies are saying, most of the outlier comments coming in now have the flavor of, well, our people are really getting wary, and our people really need to get back together. And we really need to focus on culture. And we really need to focus on bringing new people on.",0.1595826,0.743
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,95,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"So while our view hasn't changed, our conviction around the notion that it'll -- that people will get back to the office in a dramatically different way than they are today has probably grown. There will certainly be a hybrid scenario where there'll be some work from home, some work from flex space, and then of course, some work from offices. We think the configuration of offices will change, and that'll create some real opportunity for us to do work for our clients. But largely, our view is what it was 60 days ago when we reported our yearend earnings, Rick.",0.1055638,0.897
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,101,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Robert E. Sulentic,CEO and President,"It's a mixed bag, Michael. It depends. As some companies are aggressively out in the market, trying to execute plans now and others are waiting. And so, I wouldn't be able to characterize it as one thing across the board for these big occupiers we work with. I think the trend is more and more of them are deciding to have to address it. I will I will tell you one thing that we believe is going to happen. Better quality buildings with better infrastructure, better HVAC systems, better circulation around the building, better elevator systems, et cetera, are going to be in more demand as a result of this circumstance for very obvious reasons. And we think there is some chance that as we get later in the year and early next year, there could be real focus on those buildings and we'll pick up an activity.",0.0314847,0.477

But are you seeing real time impact now from the sellers maybe accelerating the timeframe for their sales, just in anticipation of any kind of changes in tax laws. Is that affecting the sales activity?",0.3290466,0.758
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,103,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We certainly have seen that happen before, Michael. I would say, this year we are seeing activity around 1031 exchanges continue to be healthy. So it is a phenomenon that we have seen play out before. And even at the end of last year, when there was some speculation that there would be tax reform in 2021, we did see some transactions come through in the fourth quarter, and that sometimes drives some of the seasonality that we see in the fourth quarter. But it's just a small portion of that.",0.6288248,0.941

First, what do you think is driving the stronger improvement in leasing and capital market trends outside of the U.S. than within the U.S.? Is that mostly due to the different progressions with the pandemic? Or are there some other notable factors to consider?",0.1423503,0.936
CBRE-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,109,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"I think it really, at least what we've seen so far, it really is driven by where economies or our restrictions around mobility has been lifted and have been reopened. So for example, in China and Australia we see office occupancy is pretty much back to pre COVID pre-pandemic levels. And those are certain markets where we are seeing return in terms of demand that is corresponding with that. So I think it really is driven by the ability for businesses to get back to normal, and for transactions to really play out. And obviously, in some of those markets we're lapping or seeing comparable financial results versus really the initial downtick for those areas as well. So we are seeing nice growth come back because of that.",0.1725055,0.805

We have a lot of capital available to us from third parties that want to invest in that business. And we have a deep knowledge of where we think development opportunities will occur because of our advisory business and the feet on the street, so to speak around the world across product types. For the longest time, we were hesitant to expand outside the United States. But the success of that business grew so much in the last decade, the interest of our Capital Partners grew so much.

As you've seen CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales particularly in the US, UK and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes. Growth was also very strong in our occupier outsourcing business, global workplace solutions where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enabled us to capture a growing share of this expanding market.",0.0910808,0.986

Leasing declined year-over-year partially offsetting the gains and sales in outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 for was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company trailing only 2018 fourth quarter. We remain optimistic unleashing growth in 2020 although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019. The contribution from our real estate investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter.",0.0957136,0.947

With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020.

Turning to slide 8, our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period. While adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. Excluding the impact of OMSR gains which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to a lesser degree Asia-Pacific.

CBRE-2019-Q4-2020-02-27,15,Remarks,2020-02-27,4,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We also saw a broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions all increasing significantly. Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies continue to increase. At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises which have actively returned to the market. Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4 with leasing and our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4, 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%.",0.0891353,0.625

In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.

CBRE-2019-Q4-2020-02-27,17,Remarks,2020-02-27,4,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Turning to slide 9, our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growths and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13% respectively. Strong revenue growth combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over a 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all three lines of business. Facilities management, project management and transaction services.

We had been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the US and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.

CBRE-2019-Q4-2020-02-27,19,Remarks,2020-02-27,4,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,Flipping to slide 10. Let's now take a look at our real estate investment segments. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the development and investment management businesses shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumption. Investments in the startup of our flexible works based business Hana also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first three Hana units in 2019 and we expect 15 to 20 units to be open by the end of 2020.,0.2691796,0.671
CBRE-2019-Q4-2020-02-27,20,Remarks,2020-02-27,4,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate flexible workspaces for institutional property owners given our creditworthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. We are pursuing a variety of deal structures including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnership, management agreements or other asset like structures over time. For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes. The UK multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019.",0.5667406,0.948
CBRE-2019-Q4-2020-02-27,21,Remarks,2020-02-27,4,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected and we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the UK with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU. As expected the US. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3 despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020. And we are continuing to transact sales that previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong as evidenced by our in process portfolio and pipeline together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019. with our in process activity increasing by . $2.1 billion while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.",0.108204,0.977

Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business, importantly investment management revenue excluding carried interest which is largely recurring fee based revenue climbed to approximately $395 million for the year.

We anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and are cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019. We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit range driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital market. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020.",0.1259424,0.948

For the global workplace solution segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts consistent with our historical average given a strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients.

We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year, as compared to 2019 when over two-thirds of this segments adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.",0.1937916,0.844

We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by it to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces resulting in revenue growth. In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% of the midpoint of our range, which if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.",0.2412417,0.84

Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx net of tenant concessions of which about half was discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx. This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana, while we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running.",0.0523282,0.898

And $145 million for share repurchases including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85. While supporting these investments we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry.

Sulentic,CEO and President,"Well, again, everything we've done in the coworking arena with Hana, has been driven by our direct work with our clients on the occupier side and our clients on the investors side. And when we've triangulated around the opportunities that were available, looking at those two groups, those are the markets we've ended up in.

CBRE-2019-Q3-2019-11-06,94,Answer,2019-11-06,3,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"I'd just say, about half of the capital expenditures that we've spent in 2019 or will spend in 2019 is really focused on that enablement spend.

CBRE-2019-Q3-2019-11-06,101,Answer,2019-11-06,3,2019,Leah Canham Stearns,Chief Financial Officer,"In terms of advisory sales in EMEA, that is something that there has been softness around. We began to see that, I'd say, a quarter or two ago. But, I think overall performance in terms of CBRE relative to the broader market, I think, we've actually done fairly well. We had a reasonably okay quarter, given the uncertainty that the market saw with Brexit. The Continent has also been down slightly, about down 5% I think in local currency. The strength on the continent has been really in France and Italy with other markets being a bit softer.",0.5170732,0.586
