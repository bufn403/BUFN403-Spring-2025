KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,7,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As we pass the midpoint of the year, I'm pleased to say that we are where we expected to be and remain on track to deliver our full year guidance. Importantly, we continue to accelerate the transformation of our business into a total beverage company by driving against the strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY: mainly, expanding our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms and a consistent strategy to offer our customers the best consumer-centric beverage portfolio; second, driving revenue growth through enhanced revenue growth management strategies and a strengthened system; third, digitizing our enterprise; and fourth and very importantly, unlocking the power of our people as we instill a growth culture and establish a new, leaner operating model.",,0.979
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,8,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"With this as the backdrop, I'd like to talk about our performance in the quarter and then drill down into actions that we are taking to drive top line growth and finally update you on refranchising and our new operating model. So firstly, starting with the quarter, ultimately amidst a weak consumer retail environment in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, and some softness in North America, our actions are enabling us to win in the market. Globally, we gained value share in total non-alcoholic beverages and in most of our category clusters.",,0.919
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,9,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"As expected, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Not only did we see a strong performance in rapidly expanding areas of our business, such as Innocent in Europe, but our revenue growth was also largely driven by innovation in sparkling soft drinks where we have continued to roll out Coca-Cola Zero Sugar around the world. Price mix continues to benefit from a focus on smaller pack sizes. Globally, our immediate consumption packs which are typically sold at a higher retail price per ounce grew unit case volume 3% in the quarter. Taken together with the effective management of our portfolio and cost structure, solid pricing enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong underlying operating margin expansion.",,0.98
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,10,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now turning to look around the world, many of our developed markets, particularly North America and Europe, continued to perform well. In North America, improving performance in our refranchised territories with a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management and some favorable timing of shipments in our foodservice business led to an organic revenue growth of 5%. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with our bottling partners resulted in strong 6% organic revenue growth.",,0.967
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,11,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Importantly, though, some of our larger markets like China and Nigeria are also accelerating top line revenue growth this year as we accelerate the revenue management strategies. However, as I noted earlier, there are still regions around the world experiencing political instability and some challenging economic conditions. Most of Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Additionally, while we believe India has taken the right steps towards modernizing its monetary and tax system, new policies have resulted in near term uncertainty for retailers and consumers that impacted the beverage industry in the first half.",,0.599
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,12,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"In all of these instances, we are responding quickly to the volatile external environment and building strategies that will allow us to deliver value to our customers by responding to these new challenges faster than the competition.",,0.557
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,13,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, let me turn and take a deeper look at some specific actions we're taking to drive revenue growth. These efforts are the result of a keen focus on innovation, small pack sizes and more robust segmentation strategies. For example, in China, we launched new innovative versions of Minute Maid Pulpy brand to serve the premium consumer segment at retail prices above the original version. In Europe, innocent, our premium juice and smoothie brand, continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth as a result of expanded distribution and product innovations, such as pack improvements and the launch of new, higher-value-added smoothies.",,0.966
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,14,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Within our sparkling soft drinks, revenue growth was driven by our no-sugar options, where we are perfecting recipes, expanding availability and supporting enhanced execution with the right level of marketing support. Specifically, we continue to see excellent results from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. This product has demonstrated strong consumer appeal in Europe, Mexico and other markets, resulting in double digit global volume growth for the brand year-to-date. So, we will continue to roll this new and improved product out across key markets, including the U.S., supported by substantial marketing and media support. And with its even more Coke-like taste, we expect it to continue to be a growing and important part of our portfolio.",,0.986
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,15,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"You all know that small packs are an important part of our business. They enable us to provide price mix-accretive offerings at affordable consumer price points as well as high-value products in developed markets like the U.S. This year's success of the small pack initiatives in China, South Africa and Central and Eastern Europe is helping to deliver growth in these markets.",,0.917
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,16,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Finally, we are looking to grow through more robust segmentation of our existing portfolio. In West Africa, for example, we are tailing (8:01) our package offerings and trade incentives for rural and urban markets even further and, as a result, we are delivering stronger top line results.",,0.812
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,17,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, to support all of these initiatives, we have been taking significant action to strengthen our system. In May, we held our annual Global System Meeting, and the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are encouraged by the innovation we are bringing to the market and are committed to support our investments with enhanced focus on local execution. And over the past year, we started to see tangible results, starting, let's say, in North America. We've seen continued strong performance from our bottlers as we complete refranchising and are confident in the actions we have taken to complete the changes this year while also improving execution in the marketplace.",,0.978
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,18,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"For example, we are seeing improved execution from Coca-Cola UNITED and Coca-Cola Beverages Florida across the state of Florida. In territories it acquired, UNITED is increasing outlet penetration in eat and drink channels whilst also improving same-store sales with local convenience stores and workplaces. These are the types of account where at the local touch from our network of independent bottlers provides a significant strategic advantage and is one of the reasons why our overall performance in North America has consistently outshined our performance in measured channels.",,0.941
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,19,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"And I'm pleased to say that we are getting close to finishing our planned refranchising activities.

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,22,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Finally, turning to Africa, we reached agreement with the South African government on conditions addressing public interest considerations in connection with our planned acquisition of ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the various regulatory approval processes and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year. As a reminder, we plan to account for these bottling territories as discontinued operations until they can be refranchised to other partners.",,0.866
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,23,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"As I laid out earlier this year, we are also embracing a new operating model and changing our culture to smart risks and be more growth orientated. As we expand our portfolio, we are taking a test and learn mentality which means some things will work right off the bat, some will need tweaking and that's all okay. For instance, we launched Honest Tea in Europe earlier this year and learned that the brand resonates better with consumers in certain channels, so we've immediately begun to evolve the packaging format and go-to-market channel strategy. We are seeing what consumers want and making adjustments immediately. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical in this rapidly changing consumer landscape.",,0.926
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,24,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now turning to our Lean center initiatives, we are on track. Much of the organizational design work we outlined earlier this year is now complete and we are rapidly implementing our new corporate structure to support faster growth. While these large-scale changes are never easy, our associates understand the need for our company to adapt and I am very encouraged by how well the organization is embracing the transformation. Our system has proven that it is taking the right actions to be successful in the market and going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming a more efficient, leaner, more agile while continuing to expand our portfolio, therefore building a strong position for future growth.",,0.969

We delivered good financial results in line with our expectations with price mix and operating expense leverage driving 6% growth in underlying profit before tax. As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations which, together with a slight currency headwind, resulted in a 16% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for the impact of currency and those divestitures, our revenue management initiatives led to 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong performance in North America, Europe and Mexico.",,0.957
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,28,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Comparable gross margin increased over 200 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising lower margin bottling businesses and strong price mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 40-basis-point currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 375 basis points, driven by the divestitures, the timing of SG&A expenses, and continued productivity.",,0.637
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,29,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Moving to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow year-to-date and have returned to our shareowners $1.6 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our annual dividend and $1.3 billion in net share purchases.",,0.778
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,30,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Turning to our comparable outlook, for the full year, we expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax. In addition, we expect divestitures of company-owned bottlers to result in a five- to six-point structural headwind to profit before tax. However, due to the strengthening of several currencies, we now expect a currency headwind to profit before tax of two points, slightly better than our previous guidance of a three-point headwind. This will result in approximately a $0.02 benefit to full-year EPS. So, we now expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher margin capital-light business model.",,0.967
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,31,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"As we model the third quarter, there are a few items to consider. First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 19- to 20-point headwind on net revenue and a nine- to ten-point headwind on profit before tax. Therefore, we also expect this to result in greater comparable growth in operating margin expansions than we saw in the first half. Second, we expect that currency will be a one- to two-point headwind on net revenues and a two- to three-point headwind on profit before tax. And then finally, as a reminder, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period.",,0.917
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,32,Remarks,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So in summary, our performance during the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. And given that many markets remain volatile, we're maintaining our currency neutral estimate. However, with a slightly better currency environment in the back half of the year, we now expect full year comparable EPS to come in $0.02 higher than our previous guidance.",,0.383

I guess, as we're kind of watching the year evolve and watching the performance, it seems like you're having good traction with a lot of the revenue initiatives, packaging product. So James, could you just talk to us about maybe sort of the flexibility you have within your plans to maybe increase some of the marketing investment, or some of that investment to drive revenue growth, given that it seems like you've got pretty good response to kind of what you're doing now?",,0.967
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,36,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Good morning. Yes. Yeah, I think we've said that we're going to manage the year, and we're going to try and put into that balance the obvious building of the business over the long term. We have stated that we'd like to get out of the trend of declining EPS, which we've seen in the last few years, and that we are going to invest where it makes sense.",,0.852
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,37,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So, we are constantly looking at where that places our momentum and should we invest more, and we have done so. And we have increased our plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good momentum and the good reasons to invest for better results. But the world remains volatile, and there are places where the environment is better suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments and where markets are just frankly under a lot of macro pressure. Extra investment is not going to drive us very far. So, we will continue to manage it with flexibility. We know that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate out of Lean Enterprise, to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide that on an ongoing basis.",,0.775

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,41,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.,,"Hi. I guess my one question is just around your organic revenue growth guidance for the full year, and just kind of how you're thinking about the puts and takes around it in the back half. So obviously, you're doing 3% year-to-date. The full year guidance implies a continuation of the similar growth rate. I think a lot of your peers are actually guiding to acceleration in the back half. And there may be some unique timing situations for you guys, but just kind of the puts and takes as you think about the back half from an organic sales growth perspective? Thanks.",,0.871
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,42,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Judy. I think a couple of things. On an as-reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter and we had the less days in the first quarter. So, I think as you look at the reported numbers, there will be some acceleration.",,0.751
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,43,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, underlying that and seen in its most simple sense of taking unit cases and price mix, as you say, we did roughly 3% in the first quarter and roughly 3% this quarter. We're guiding to 3% for the rest of the year because, frankly, the world has not changed. We're doing a lot of the right things in the places that are going well, and frankly, some of the ones that need to be fixed. But we don't see the world is improving rapidly, and therefore we're not banking on that happening and so we're more focused on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of how that's going to play out in the rest of the year. And I think the expectation for the downhill should be more of the same of what we've had so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as we get towards the end.",,0.932

Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",,"James, one of the things we've heard with regards to U.S. refranchising is that as they've taken over the territories, that are actually performing maybe better than Coke was when they were doing it. And you've seen an acceleration in some markets. They've been a little more aggressive. So, I guess, this is really one question. Is that the case? Why is that happening?

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,50,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Yes. I think the headline answer is yes, it's happening. And I think it was part of the design and the strategy. To be fair to the team running CCR, they have been improving the operations of Coca-Cola Refreshments over the years and have been getting increasingly better results over time and doing a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better coordinated national operations.",,0.953
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,51,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"But there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new territories, they have been very energetic in trying to improve them. They have made good progress particularly in some of the non-directly measured channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores where they build on their local expertise. So, I think, it is in aggregate a tail-wind. It was part of the strategy that it should be that way, and I think, it's a compliment to the local bottlers that they are driving that forward.",,0.913

So quantify how much is coming from bottling divestitures, how much from expense management, how much from timing of expenses, which I assume that means is coming back at some point. So really want to disaggregate that and quantify that.

So the operating margin expansion, the 375 basis points, I mean, clearly we see that operating margins are expanding, when you see that we're at 6% in (22:40) profit before tax and on organic revenues of 3%. The upside is driven by that price mix and so you know exactly where the price mix came from in terms of a lot of it being driven by North America and EMEA in this quarter. And then the timing of SG&A expenses. Yes, part of that is - yeah, it will moderate over the balance of the year. But that wasn't really the bulk of what was driving that. It's more about the productivity and cost management that we have in the year. So we have more plans over the next couple of years for additional - for the rest of the productivity and that will continue to drive operating margin expansion.",,0.859
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,57,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Plus just the refranchising itself has driven a lot of that 375 basis points. As we have gotten out of the capital-intensive businesses, the more people-intensive businesses, that specifically drove that 375 basis points. So we had guided to the fact that our operating margins were going to go up after the refranchising. We plan to be in that range and continue to look for obviously other opportunities to increase operating margins as we go forward. So basically think about it as the refranchising driving most of that, good price mix and the cost management and the other productivity that we will continue to get over the next couple of years.",,0.794

Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC,,"I was just hoping to get an update on your Gold Peak and Dunkin' Donuts ready-to-drink coffees and whether you think there's an opportunity to expand these brands globally at some point.

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,63,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Yeah, sure. Morning. I think, we're very happy that we're doing well in teas and coffees, both globally and in North America. Obviously, the Dunkin' one is early days. Good start. I think, Gold Peak is a good tea brand and again, an early start on the coffee. The basis of our kind of ready-to-drink coffee business and strong global position is actually Asia. So we have some strong brands there. So I don't think you should see it as there's going to be one brand for ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea across the world. We're going to see some strong growth coming out of Asia in Asian teas. Yes, we're launching Honest Tea in Europe as the joint venture with Nestle winds down teas in the European space at the end of the year. So you will see us use some of our brands more broadly, but it won't be one brand everywhere.",,0.951

James, I wanted to build on the test and learn comments that you made upfront and the quest for speed and agility. There's some great examples that you've highlighted today in terms of portfolio progress, especially in Europe with smartwater and innocent and Zero Sugar and Honest. But what I'm trying to understand is, can you talk more about the specific, any specific steps or tools or incentives that you're putting in place to facilitate that speed and agility? Because in the end, I'm just trying to get a better feel for what that looks like in terms of day-to-day changes and how you push for speed, and, at the same time, efficiently manage risk and portfolio complexity as you accelerate into new SKUs and additional category country combinations.

But I think the net of the answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process-process. Having said that, we're clear on when we're talking about test and learn or experiment, that people need to understand the scale and the potential impact of the experiments they're undertaking. In other words, we are starting to use some frameworks to classify how people are going after things.",,0.599
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,68,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life threatening, do lots of them, learn quickly, and move on. I mean, if the experiment is potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more closely. So we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the portfolio in the market so that they can categorize what sort of strategy and what sort of scale of experiment are they undertaking, whether it's a launch of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera. And so the risk can be managed appropriately. And it's all about what's the potential downside to the corporation.

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,69,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"But as I said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset. It's the essential idea that the world is undergoing some important structural changes, multiple ones at the same time. And that is causing disruptions on many fronts, and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130-plus years, which is stay relevant for the consumer and help our customers grow their businesses. And that's cultural.

And I think the employees understand that. I think that's why the Lean Enterprise is resonating, and I think that's why it will get pushed through.

I don't like throwing the weather under the bus, but that's the Q2. I think in the longer-term trend, well, I think water will continue to grow, particularly enhanced water, premium waters, I think, you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by competitors in that space.

So to you and your team's credit, there's been universally positive response from the investment community around the changes that you've implemented.

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,97,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC,,"So the question is, how quickly can you deliver on that trajectory of about 4%, which is where I think you sort of peg overall NARTD growth, at least something reasonable longer-term? How much can you drive with strategic changes and share gains? How much of this is maybe just cycling Brazil, which is a big market for the company? How much do you need an overall improvement in the macro to sort of take this growth rate from 3% to 4%, and over what time period do you think is sort of reasonable for investors? Thank you.",,0.916

Just mechanically, if Brazil and Venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown 1 point faster.

We've got to - one of the dangers being 130-plus years successful is you think you've got the answer to some things whereas we really need to have lots of curiosity about how things could be different, could be better, and how we respond to the way things are changing and then, of course, there needs to be some courage to try new things.",,0.955
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,121,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"I talked earlier about that's got to be managed with risk appetite. All experiments are not born equal and there will be lots of tolerance for doing it in a sensible way and then commitment to making things better. And I think all of that can be created. Of course, the tone needs to be set from the top. We need to put in place the training and the programs and if people understand why, I think you get a much more empowered autonomous organization that is capable of creating a better future.",,0.934

KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,123,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP,,"Good morning, everyone. When I think of refranchising being completed by the end of the year in the U.S., you're going to end up with a very, very fragmented bottling system which is the opposite of what you have in other parts of the world and in turn has been for consolidation (44:09). So why does that make sense? Isn't that a problem or should we assume that five years from now, that system will look a lot more consolidated? And related to that, the fountain business remains in the hands of Coke. I think it's about 35% of volumes. It doesn't make sense for you to over time to gradually convert the fountain business into RTDs, or is that just impossible to do? Thanks.",,0.563
KO-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,124,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Yeah. Let me talk about the question around the bottling system and refranchising. Firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but principally the U.S. bottling system by the end of this year will be a relatively small number of bottlers distributed in a very logical geographic distribution across the country, which has moved away from the great mosaic of the past of the patchwork quilt. I think what we will have is people who are really strong locally in their marketplaces where they know what to do and the U.S. is not one place, there are lots of local differences, but the important element of the strategy in the U.S. is the putting in place of the structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one; act as one with customers; act as one from a production system; act as one in terms of IT; act as one in terms of really working out what's the strategy. So, it will be a strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the system. It's in place. I think they've done a great job over the last several years in bringing it to life and delivering top-class results in the U.S. environment and I think that's going to continue to be the system of the future.",,0.985

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,8,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and underlining that we're winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets and also the sparkling soft drink category. We're gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid out for you in early 2017. And importantly, our operating performance is accelerating as a result.",,0.981
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,9,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So 2018, at the halfway mark of the year, we're seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price/mix. Global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest we've seen in five years. And comparable EPS is up 5% year-to-date, despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. And, as we noted at the start of the year, we've always expected EPS growth to be back half-weighted and that has not changed.",,0.845
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,10,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. And while we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asian markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top line acceleration.",,0.971
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,11,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Turning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focus on the fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a 10-day transport strike in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our system worked hard to recover momentum. And by the end of the quarter, we had bounced back to pre-strike growth rates.",,0.935
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,12,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 7% year to date through balanced volume and price/mix. We see solid momentum in the emerging and developing markets, with notable strength in Central Europe and Turkey. And in the developed markets, we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio through additions like Fuze Tea, Honest Coffee, and AdeZ plant-based beverages across Europe.",,0.898
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,13,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"In North America, we're delivering strong performance in the marketplace year to date. According to Nielsen, our U.S. retail sales are up 3% in the second quarter, driven by both volume and pricing. We are pleased with the performance of our innovation and brand-building initiatives. Our no-sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail value growth in the quarter, thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero Sugar.",,0.971
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,14,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. POWERADE ZERO, DASANI Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double digits.

Stepping back, the overall market remains disciplined, and we remain focused on executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price/mix over time. However, as you can see, reported price/mix in North America continued to differ from market-level performance.",,0.637
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,16,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"This was principally due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecast. And as we noted in the first quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price/mix for 2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which net out in the year, between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on price/mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported price/mix, as our concentrates sparkling business grew faster than our finished goods business, particularly the juice and tea.",,-0.573
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,17,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the reported price/mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see versus the growth in scanner data. We're taking pricing actions alongside our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive price/mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate, as our package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully implemented and the timing items reverse. These factors, along with the continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial performance in North America in the back half.",,0.832
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,18,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating, with double-digit organic revenue growth year to date. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering low single-digit organic revenue growth.",,0.637
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,19,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we're driving disciplined sustainable growth in the business, obviously, first, it requires a solid understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we're expanding our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and sustaining successful brands across markets. But disciplined growth also requires that our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with consumers' needs. We're working diligently to increase our capabilities in this area because satisfying key consumption occasions allows us to attract new drinkers and ultimately achieve quality leadership.",,0.96
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,20,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"One example of this is Georgia Coffee in Japan. Georgia has historically had a strong male consumer base in Japan. So we recently launched a new variant called Craftsman with recipes, flavors, and packaging designed to appeal more to the new consumer segments, in particular younger adults and women.",,0.62
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,21,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Craftsman's drinks come in premium, glass-like PET bottles that are resealable, making them portable and easier to consume. This is a change from the traditional cans, opening up new consumption occasions that were previously untapped. We're off to a good start, with our coffee portfolio in Japan reversing recent trends and growing volume mid-single digits.",,0.751
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,22,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"This kind of discipline of taking a very tailored approach to consumption occasions and channels is also one of the ways we're attracting new sparkling drinkers. For our flagship brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging the brand's edge, which is centered around uplift and energize, to build consumption rituals through consumers with strategic innovation.",,0.886
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,23,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"An example, Coca-Cola with coffee, this product started as a trial in Australia. Other markets are now introducing it, but with twists based on the learning. In Vietnam, for example, the brewed coffee category is very large, so we introduced Coke Plus Coffee there with great coffee cues like aroma, with less sugar, positioning it as an alternative pick-me-up for the traditional coffee drinker. Execution was targeted and deliberate, focusing on specific occasions and channels, like the mid-afternoon pick-me-up, in coffee shops and at work. And the early results are very promising, delivering incremental growth for the Coca-Cola brand with very little cannibalization.",,0.966
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,24,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"While this is just one specific example, it is indicative of the broader strategic approach we are taking to reinvigorate the sparking category. It's about leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it.",,0.758
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,25,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Actions like this around the world have helped us accelerate the performance of Coke trademark, with global volume up 2% year-to-date. Of course, driving disciplined growth is not just about expanding our beverage portfolio. It's about shaping quality leadership for sustainable revenue profit and cash flow growth. Therefore, it is critical that we reduce complexity to ensure our system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient and our innovation pipeline gains more space and visibility at the point of sale.",,0.96
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,26,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"To that end, we've been identifying and killing zombie brands and SKUs while focusing our teams on the work that matters most. Many of you have asked what we mean by zombie brands and where the opportunities are. So let me try and give a few examples.",,-0.402

To-date, we've discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the year, allowing us to reallocate resources to brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest return.",,0.0
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,28,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Given the benefits we're seeing, of course, we're embedding the elimination of zombie SKUs and brands even further into existing routines, instilling this discipline deeper into our business units. This taking a more disciplined approach to our portfolio is only one of the ways we're looking to reduce complexity in the business.",,0.382
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,29,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"We're also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most, driving a productivity mindset in the business with the aim of both funding reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a recent review, we've significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in one of our largest business units to ensure that we are sufficiently allocating resources to the highest return on investment projects, rather than targeting too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity actions we've laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying operating income growth for the first half of the year, while continuing to reinvest behind our brands, because ultimately it's not just about growth for the sake of growing. Growth must translate into solid returns for our investors.",,0.958
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,30,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So taking a step back and looking at the remainder of the year, global economic growth remains robust. Now, of course, there is some level of uncertainty from geopolitical risk and escalating trade conflicts, but our industry remains vibrant and growing. And we are winning and we have momentum in the business. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year, increasing our currency headwinds in the back half. So all-in-all, with increasingly currency headwinds partially offset by momentum in the business, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year.",,0.952

We delivered 5% organic revenue growth through balanced growth in our volume and price/mix, giving us confidence in our top-line acceleration. The solid organic revenue growth, combined with our ongoing productivity measures, drove 8% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottler refranchising activity last year.",,0.973

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Our comparable operating margin increased more than 300 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an almost 200 basis point impact of the new accounting standards and currency. Productivity helped to drive the underlying operating margin expansion, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our corporate segment due to the Lean Center initiative we began during the second quarter of last year. The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was in line with our expectations.",,0.813
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,35,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, the impact to operating margins was the most extreme for North America, resulting in over 200 basis points of compression in that segment's margin. Below the line, performance was as we expected, allowing us to deliver comparable EPS growth of $0.61, up 3% in the quarter.",,0.527
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,36,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So as I turn to the remainder of the year, considering our strong performance in the first half of the year and for reasons James spoke to, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue and underlying operating income growth. Specifically, we now expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and underlying operating income growth of at least 9%. At the same time, the expected currency headwinds to full year operating income is now expected to be 4%, an increase of three to four points since the beginning of the year. And, as James mentioned, we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%.",,0.949
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,37,Remarks,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Turning to cash flow, we now expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. This is down from our initial outlook of at least $8.5 billion, largely driven by higher than anticipated tax payment related to an amendment of the prior year's tax return and stronger currency headwinds.",,0.382

So I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about POWERADE's position maybe like in the rest of the markets outside the U.S., the big ones that matter, kind of market share growth trends, relative importance of the category, because it does seem that it perhaps has greater legs maybe than people tend to think.

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,51,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"And obviously, one of the things that's been helping drive POWERADE in the U.S. and, indeed, globally, in the second quarter was, of course, its link and the activation related to the FIFA World Cup event, where it's one of the brands that's both advertised and present, and so we did a lot of marketing programs on that. So I think part of what you're seeing is the payoff of the marketing programs and the linkage into football.",,0.296

The sports drink category is much bigger in the Americas than it is in the rest of the world. You tend to see more everyday hydration. We have brands like Aquarius, which is big in a number of parts of Europe and does well in Japan. So the rest of the world is not as big in sports drinks as the Americas is.

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,54,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,"Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",,"Great, thanks. So, there are, obviously, a lot of moving parts in the business with all the structural items, the accounting changes and FX. But the reported gross margin this quarter was just a little light, at least of external projections. So I was wondering if you could just get underneath all the changes and talk about how the underlying gross margin might be trending. It looks to me like maybe they're down modestly year-over-year, which would be consistent with the business mix away from CSDs and towards stills. But then again, sparkling has been kind of trending in line with the total company growth, if not a little bit ahead, year-to-date. So I'm not sure that's the full explanation. So maybe you could just talk about where gross margins have landed year-to-date versus your own internal expectations and how do you expect them to evolve from here? Thank you.",,0.646
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,55,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Hi, Steve. So, underlying comparable gross margins expanded about 90 basis points. That really is driven by structural. So 300 basis points is due to structural and then that's offset by some currency and about 200 basis points from the accounting changes, as you said, a lot of moving parts in the quarter.",,-0.521
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,56,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Underlying is under pressure and it's basically it's still moderate pressure, but it's under pressure due to - we said as we're expanding into other categories and you said yourself as we go into more finished goods businesses, that we were going to have margin pressure.

Clearly, you downsized there metro volumes down, but it didn't really seem to show any price/mix pickup. And maybe downsizing was just commodities and it was a smaller deal, but if you contrast that to when you were chaining the pack architecture in a bigger way or downsizing in sparkling, the price/mix elasticity was much better. You got more transactions, so the volume wasn't down as much.",,0.818

Is it purely commodities, or is there something from a pack architecture in juices and teas? And then also looking forward for that, will that continue to be a drag for the next several quarters in North America? Thanks for those two.",,0.45
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,62,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Okay. Let me focus in on the North American tea, juices, et cetera, et cetera, because that of course links to the price/mix. It's probably a slightly longer answer than just tea and juice because it ladders up into the overall price/mix question. And of course, here, there's a temptation to just look at the trees and miss the forest. But I'll try and come from the detail up to the strategic answer.",,0.077
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,63,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So what's happened in tea and juice, particularly juice, there's clearly some cost pressure. The cost of orange juice inputs, the cost of the packaging we use for our juice business, in particular our chilled juice business, had a lot of cost pressure. So we took, I think, the right strategic decision to try and contain the absolute level of price points in the store by downsizing some of the packages, which we did essentially at the beginning of Q2. What did that cause? It caused us to go down in volume obviously, but we actually got positive pricing in orange juice. If you go to the Nielsen numbers, you can see that pricing in orange juice is up.",,0.689
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,64,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"And so I think what you see is volumes are down, prices are up. Competitors and the retailers, on balance, didn't follow us overnight. They probably followed us closer at the beginning of the third quarter, so that's starting to come through. So we had probably a larger volume impact, which is unfortunate, but traditional for the price leader. And so that's the story in juice. I think the juice thing will start to improve as we get into the back half. We'll do better competitively. And I think the consumer environment will adjust to the new packaging and the new price points.",,0.772
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,65,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, what's interesting as you do modeling is it's really important to remember that in our numbers, we are combining the finished product business of chilled juice with the concentrate business of sparkling. Why is that important? The finished product business has a much higher revenue per unit than the sparkling concentrate business does. So in fact, what is actually happening in North America is we have positive pricing on juice. Our pricing is up, not just the market pricing. Our pricing is up on sparkling as well as the market pricing. Then you're going to ask the question, how can the overall be down. It's because juice is declining, there's a mathematical effect where the weighting of the juice decline counts for more - the loss of the juice volume counts for more than the fact both are going up.",,0.91
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,66,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So you can actually have an averaging problem, whereby both categories' pricings are going up, but the average is going down, which is the 2% headwind that we talked about coming from category mix. That will normalize itself out as juice does better into the year. And obviously, it's not really an operating income problem because you're mixing apples and pears with the finished product business and the sparkling business.",,0.307
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,67,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"That's why as you start to look through what's happening in Q2 in North America, it can be distracting to look at all these negatives. But when you layer it up to what's really going on, we're doing the right strategic actions in each category. We're downsizing the juice category. We're focusing on low and no-sugar in the sparkling. We're focusing on smaller pack sizes, all of these allowing us, with the exception of juice in the short term, to get some volume growth, definitely get some transaction growth, getting price/mix in each category. That will layer up over time to generate value for the customers and to realize pricing in the marketplace. And so as these temporary factors play out, you'll start to see the North America business go positive in the second half.",,0.922
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,68,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"It's all about our long-term strategy of engaging with more consumers with smaller packages, more frequency, more frequently to drive value with our customers to have a better, more valuable consumer franchise. We've been executing that with our bottlers over the last few years. We've been winning in the marketplace. We're winning in the marketplace so far this year, and our strategy is on track. And therefore, I think it's important to look at those North American effects and to see them for what they are, and they are not a deviation. They're temporal and we'll be back on track with our strategy in the second half.",,0.957

I think the cash from operations guidance for the year has come down a little bit, so just some color in terms of what's driving that. And, Kathy, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about still the commitment to paying down $7 billion of gross debt. And it looks like, at least year-to-date, there hasn't been that much done.

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,82,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Hi, Bryan. The cash from operations, the reason we took the shift from $8.5 billion down to $8 billion is really based upon two things. That's one would be the worsening currency environment of about three to four points that we talked about. And the second really is basically this impact of an unanticipated cash tax payment that was related to two prior year tax returns and that's a timing. So that will not reverse in the current year, but we'll get that back in subsequent years. So that was why we changed the guidance.",,-0.25
KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,83,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"The cash from operations basically is we build it up from bottoms up. So we've got the line of sight to get to our new number. And it does not impact the $7 billion that we're going to pay down on the debt. That's how we plan to come from existing cash. That paydown, so far, you're right. We paid about $2 billion down so far this year. It is basically we're going to pay it down as it matures. So we've got maturity through 2019 to get to that $7 billion. So we are continuing and we're on track to pay down the $7 billion and the tax guidance does not impact that at all.",,-0.527

The price increase I just talked about on the last question is predominantly the price increase from the bottling system on the sparkling brands in particular, which faced a whole series of input costs: freight, yes; plastic resins, yes; metal in all its various forms for many reasons, including tariffs. So there is some broad-based push on input costs that have kind of come in and affected us and many other industries as well.

The price increases that I talk about on juice, we took that effectively in the first half of the year, which is already planned with the retailers and the change in the packaging size that came into effect around the beginning of the second quarter. So there are a lot of moving pieces here on pricing in North America and I think it's important to disaggregate them. But again, once you disaggregate them, step back and come back to the overall picture, which is the categories are getting positive pricing. We've had positive pricing in the U.S. for several years now.

I just wanted to get a sense of the potential headwind in 2019 as the hedges unwind. And then, the real question is on Latin America. The results were obviously strong in the quarter. We've seen a lot of political currency and economic volatility in the region recently. So I just want to get an update on your level of confidence if the momentum can continue in the second half and I guess your view of the potential impact on your business or any risk in that region from the external environment here.",,0.806

The hedging gains in this year, actually we're cycling hedging gains from the prior year, which are impacting us in this year, particularly in EMEA. So they are obviously hedging gains are helping to offset to some extent. But really they're more of a cycling issue for us for this year. And so therefore, the next year, which I think was your underlying question, next year, I really don't anticipate that there will be much impact with us having to cycle hedging gains from 2018 into 2019.",,0.902

Latin America, look, I think partly - we had a good start in Latin America, no doubt about it.

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,125,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"I think sometimes the fears of what might happen are much greater than actually what happens. That may be true of Mexico. I think the Mexican environment looks like it's going to be stable and positive. Brazil, the strike is over. Clearly, the Brazilian economy is doing better than it was doing last year and the last few years. Argentina is looking a little more tricky. But look, we've been here before in Latin America several times. I don't think there's something that says everything suddenly all going to go wrong. So I think we've got a good plan for the second half in Latin America, together with our bottling partners. We're focused on growing the business. It's a part of the world we all understand, and I think we've got great plans to engage with the customers and the consumers.",,0.972

We have volume growth in the U.S., which we didn't have for a long time. We've got positive pricing there. So I think the execution of the bottlers continues to be strong.

So the system remains strong. Of course, there are countries here and there that are challenging. The system remains strong. It's executing, and so therefore, collectively we're all doing better. I think the headline growth by the company is symbolic and a proxy for the fact the system, this bottling system is also doing better.",,0.958

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Yes, so pricing was up 12% in the quarter and that was driven from strong price/mix in Mexico, Brazil, South Latin.

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,137,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So when you talk about margins, though, the operating margins are down 120 basis points. Comparable operating margins are down, but year-to-date margins are up 80 basis points. And that is driven pretty much from structural. So we had structural in this year as we are refranchising a couple of bottlers in Latin America, and that's offset by some currency and a little bit from the accounting change. But the underlying business in Latin America expanded and is doing well. So most of that 80 points of year-to-date margin expansion is due to the underlying business and the strong price/mix.",,0.908

KO-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,142,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Sure. Overall concentrate CSD sales, at the headline level, in line with unit cases, and of course there's one day less in the first half, which on a straight line basis is about 0.5 point, one day in 180. So it's not a massive difference. In theory, it will reverse itself in the second half, which in a way is a small headwind in the second half. But I think I wouldn't over-engineer the thing. There's no big buildup of inventory of concentrates or finished products. It's largely a building ahead of a strong summer, a strong marketing program with FIFA. Therefore, I think it evens itself out over time. We may be fractionally ahead in the year-to-date. Maybe it'll come off in the remainder of the year, but it's always in the bounds of what we're expecting.",,0.586

So FX, freight, commodities, it worsened. Perhaps investment levels are higher in North America to match Pepsi. You can comment on the last one, if you'd like to, but top line better.

So on the EPS guidance, obviously, the underlying business continues to perform well, as evidenced by us taking up our OI targets. I think the thing you're not focusing on is first, there's less deleveraging below the line than we previously talked about earlier in the year.

In South Africa, we didn't do so well in the second quarter. That was anticipated because of the implementation of the sugar tax in South Africa in Q2. We had a reasonably good plan. I don't think we perhaps were as aggressive on the reformulations as we should have been. Competitors were more aggressive. And so we quickly course-corrected in the quarter and now we're better.

I mean market share -- firstly our headline approach on market share is to win in the channels that are open. I mean it's -- we've talked about it on the last quarter it's clear.

In fact, we had a senior leadership meeting with the top 200 in February before the crisis became completely apparent where we started to talk about what would it take to bring a much more networked organization to life and started to talk about some of the dimensions.

So it is very much a continuation of where we're going. It's an agenda item that was clear. It was coming. Obviously in February, we were at the relative beginning stages. What the time of COVID particularly Q2 what that did to influence the program was really a couple of things. One, it was clear that when we took the actions to refocus the system on safety and continuity of supply in Q2, the clarity of moving quickly on refocusing on fewer SKUs and the boldness of those decisions are paid off very quickly. And the insight was not just that, but the ability of the organization to act with speed was very encouraging.

Of course, the other thing that came out of pandemic was a decision to try and make it as enrolling and engaging with the organization as possible even at the risk of having a longer period of uncertainty because the design is more in the public.

And it also happens to be the case that the network of distributors the Molson Coors has also connects with some of the parallel businesses of people who are connected to the Coke system.

We've - as I mentioned, we've taken quick actions in March to anticipate whatever outcome in the back half of the year good bad or indifferent. Keep in mind that, with our bottlers over 50% of our business globally is in the hands of our large public play on bottlers, all of whom came into 2020 with strong balance sheets.

Can you give us a bit more detail around the key drivers there? And I'm wondering specifically how much of a tailwind is less COVID impact for 2022 that occurred in 2021 or above-trend pricing given the cost situation and limited demand elasticity relative to a typical year? And the point behind the question is sort of why are you above the 4% to 6% long-term algorithm? Is it more sustainable factors that can sustain as we look beyond 2022?

And secondly, we very much are not looking to just pass through in price but to do it intelligently because, whilst it's easy to respond to inflation by putting up the prices, there is clearly, as there is broad-based inflation, going to be a squeeze on real incomes in a number of countries. And so, we -- with very long experience in the system of managing inflationary moments when you get a squeeze on real incomes, we very much want to, yes, the company opportunities on premiumization, leverage our strong marketing, leverage our strong innovation. But we do not want to lose consumers out of the industry, so we also will have a foot in affordability. And this is a scenario where we have a lot of experience.

It's certainly our historical experience that when multiple categories go off at the same time, there is less elasticity. But it is also our experience that often that it's in an environment of a crisis where there's a support of a lot of injection of money into the economy, which I think is what has been happening over the last couple of years.

And I missed all the cost pressures that we've spoken about and your plans to drive forward operating leverage and continued progress on operating profit. I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about the invented flexibility you have and your plans around strategic investments in '22 specifically? Where those are targeted?

We switched during the crisis and leaning into growth or a bias to invest.

We've got a lot of ability drive not just the market innovation, but also underline the advances in the digitization of the business, whether it's the connection with the consumer, whether it's the connection with the retailers and what the bottlers are doing to digitize that part of the business.

I think the short answer first, it was always intended to be one of the arrows in the quiver. The longer version of that answer is clearly COVID impacted, not just our total business, but it impacted the cost of business, which is an almost entirely away-from-home business. And so, it was very much a bit like our fountain business in the U.S. It was very much in the crosshairs of the COVID impact, particularly in 2020 at the beginning when the lockdowns were very severe.

And as you say, we have not chosen to change it to a concentrate model. In fact, to be more specific, we're keeping the current operating model where the manufacturing of the product is largely done with co-packers. And that is what has been driving the momentum, and we have no plans to change the model with using the co-packers at this stage. They're doing a great job.

We have no immediate plans to do so. Again, it would be a mechanical effect on the revenue and the gross margin because it wouldn't be changing the profit coming from BODYARMOR. It would be more of a mechanical effect on the top -- on the gross margin for operating model reasons. But as I said, our intention is to operate it very broadly as we do at the moment, connected but not integrated, so that we can continue to drive the growth at what has been a very successful brand.

At-home volumes also showed ongoing strength even as away-from-home channels improved. The quarter was off to a promising start in July, but the Delta variant impacted several markets, resulting in a softer August, followed by improvement in September, as the variant began to lessen in some of our key markets.

Unit case growth was 6%, with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year, and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a 2 year basis.

We've been proactively accelerating our revenue growth management, and productivity levers to offset some of this pressure as we look out to next year. And we're closely monitoring the moving parts in the supply chain to ensure we are well-positioned to meet demand. Moving to marketing dollars, we'll continue to invest purposefully in our brands and markets to support top-line growth, with spend more heavily weighted towards consumer-facing activities.

Now, in the quarter as you say, we called out that July started well, and then August was softer as there were more lock downs and then September was better. When you think about where that's going in the fourth quarter and into next year, clearly the fact that we have raised or clarified guidance on revenue to be the top end of the range should lead you to feel confident that we see visibility in the downhill of the rest of this year.

And then as it goes through 2022, obviously too early to call the full year next year, and we will do so in February. But again, in the comments, in the press release, in John's comments, we said we feel that we think we have momentum in the business.

Last quarter, you talked about isolated pressure points and definitely offered commentary to say that you're able to tap into supplier relationships and so on. But I was just curious I guess, what's the thought that bottlers continue to try to build inventory, not just in advance of 4Q, but even looking into '22, that you kind of maintain this disconnect between them and concentrate shipments and unit case volume, but also to talk a little bit on the packaging side of things and what the system is able to do to have better access to the range of packaging options.

We've talked previously about can pressure in the U.S. self-evidently, there's issues in shipping and freight and availability of labor in places, then you get one that pops up. The price of gas spikes in Europe, and the availability of CO2 comes under pressure.

Our brands need to earn the right to adjust their prices each year, whether that be because of the marketing, the innovation, the execution, the investment in the marketplace, or the pressure on COGS, or the pressure on labor inflation.

And so we see our approach as earning the rights to take the price that creates value for ourselves, the system, and creates value for the retailers and creates value for the consumers. And that's our starting point. Yes, we did take an off-cycle increase in the U.S. Obviously slightly different by brand and by pack, but certainly in the high-single-digits, starting in August, the elasticity is perhaps a little better than they were last time. You may remember that whatever it was, 4 or 5 years ago, we took an off-cycle price increase in the U.S. when there was a very strong adjustments in the logistics market in the U.S. that caused everyone a great deal of problems.

You mentioned obviously that 3 volumes finished ahead of 19 for the first time since the pandemic started which is obviously a happy achievement.

Obviously, we're working with the bottlers on a collective basis, and an individual and country basis.

Can I please follow up on Bonnie's question as it relates to the incidence pricing model and maybe some of the new models that we're putting in recent years? How does it work in this environment? Because the pricing is, of course, still taken by the bottlers, but I guess the relative price inflation -- the relative cost inflation is much higher at the bottler than it might be for yourselves. I understand that you take it as a system, but how does that work from an incidence pricing perspective? Does it still hold in that you were able to follow on wherever the bottler does in the marketplace or are there tweaks being made for what right now seems to be a bit of an abnormal situation?",0.0369096,-0.107
KO-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,66,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"No, the incidence model works as the incidence model, which to be clear is generally speaking, that the Company's revenue on any particular brand or package is a percent of what the bottler is getting, it's not the same percent necessarily on every brand or even every package. But it is a percent. And then all the time this has proven to be a great way of maintaining alignment and shared interest in driving value for the Company and the bottlers local management. When a brand or a package or a channel or occasion grows, it's good for both the bottler and the Company, and if we decide to push on something that's more affordable, it delivers less for the bottler and the Company.",0.0663122,0.361
KO-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,67,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the incidence is proven to be a tremendous vehicle of getting the franchise system to focus on creating value in the marketplace. Overtime in certain environments it puts -- the rest of the cost structure puts a little more pressure on the bottler or a little more pressure on the Company depending on what's going on. But we don't course -- micro course correct the incidence for small problems or in potentially medium problems. We look at a holistic view of making sure the bottling system is structurally sound, is -- has got the right capabilities, the right ownership, and the right capacity to invest in the marketplace. So it's something completely pushes the thing on -- off track. We're in a different situation. Otherwise, we and the bottlers don't manage for the short term.

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,76,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks. I think the first fundamental point to make is we don't see any change in our underlying business momentum. As we consider the global macros and the geopolitics and the wins that could buffer things, we've got really focused on what we can control and what we can drive and really putting together a program around the brand building, the innovation, the revenue growth management and the execution. That's served us well in 2019 and we believe it will serve us well in 2020. So we're expecting a solid result in 2020. There were a few puts and takes in 2019 that perhaps favor the result a little. The contribution from BIG which obviously is a little more disproportionately contributing on the revenue versus the profit line. So we feel that as we look out into 2020, we're seeing the same momentum, the same levers we know how to pull. And when you compare it backwards to kind of a two-year run rate or make a small adjustment for BIG, I think you'd see it's very much in line with what we're delivering. Of course, if we do better in the year, we'll update guidance as and when that becomes appropriate. But we think we got a great plan, we've got solid momentum, 10 quarters of doing in the range and I think that's how you should think about 2020.",0.2361589,0.985

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,78,Question,2020-01-30,4,2019,Steve Powers,,"Great. Thanks. Maybe just sticking with the top line, 2019 was a great year on organic growth as you just described but particularly in terms of price/mix realization. I guess the question is, is there a way to parse out how much of the five points of price mix you realized in '19 was driven by initiatives that you would see as real and repeatable versus things that might be considered more one-time step-ups or pricing simply as a byproduct of outsize inflation in certain emerging markets? And I guess more importantly as you think about the composition of growth in 2020, do you expect a similar price/mix versus volume composition or is it to be more balanced as we look forward?",,0.952
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,79,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Steve. Look, lots of moving pieces as one looks at the aggregate price/mix ratio. Obviously 2019 was a little heavier around price/mix. I think there was some inflation coming through places like Argentina. We've certainly talked about previously how we're looking for a balance between volume and price over time as you get up into the 5% to 6% growth; 6 last year, 5 the year before, looking for 5. We're looking for 2 to 3 of each. So clearly 5 would be more than we would imagine is the long term. But we're going to focus on what drives the core business. The way I think about pricing is that pricing has to be earned, it has to be earned with the consumer, it has to be earned with the customer because they want their business to grow. So it's about the brand building, it's about the innovation, it's about the RGM initiatives. We've talked on previous calls about how we see that as a long runway of opportunity on RGM on the pricing and the packaging opportunities and of course executing it. And just final thought is in 2019, the price/mix is a little over weighted by what happened with BIG being very strong as well. So we'll continue to push to earn pricing and we'll be looking going forward for a balance between price/mix and volume.",0.5764779,0.972

I hope that's true. I hope that's right. But we are certainly kind of keep looking for your top line to show leverage on your EPS line and that seems to be a little bit more elusive. I want your perspective on that. 2020 guidance that you've given, obviously 5% organic top line growth, that's only 7% EPS growth. For a lot of other companies that would be much higher than that in the FMCG world. And I love your perspective on why that is for you guys in particular whether that can change, and in particular why not get more leverage out of being more decisive on your share buyback at this point especially, John, to your point given how free cash flow is improving.

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,84,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, firstly, I think our long-term growth model is pretty clear. And the revenue guidance for 2020 is in the middle of the range and the operating income guidance is in the middle of the range and yet we're still projecting at this point in time a mild currency headwind which then gives us the 7 on EPS. So I think the key is to keep looking at the underlying performance of the business in currency neutral and there's good leverage built in there, and we've certainly benefitted over the last number of years from a lot of leverage for having coming out of refranchising having focused on productivity, having used innovation to give us leverage between revenue and operating income. We see ourselves entering a more steady phase where there is continued leverage from revenue to operating income, in this case three points in the guidance for 2020 and it's partly being driven by productivity and partly being driven by innovation and revenue growth management. So I think those should be the stable outlook going forward having come off a very strong period of getting operating leverage. Do you want to say anything about earnings, John?",0.5508289,0.985

We've got to look at it in the context of two areas. One is our overall capital allocation priorities. And then secondly, the cash we have available at a given point in time. So with respect to capital allocation priorities, I think we've been pretty consistent that priority number one is to invest in the business; number two, to grow the dividend; number three, to look at opportunistic M&A. And then number four is to look at share repurchase. That has to be in the context of cash we have available. And while our free cash flow progress in 2019 was terrific, I think when you take a step back and look at the cash we have available, last year and even this year we're talking about a relatively small amount. So we'll continue to factor that into our decision making as we go through 2020 and into 2021.",2.2158697,0.972

First on, I just wanted to talk a little bit about cash because the cash conversion was a pretty dramatic change, I think 96% by my math, and I know working capital benefits probably helped a little bit with that, but the guidance is still really strong for next year. So if you can just talk a little bit about how you've driven such a big step change in performance on that front and speak a bit to sustainability? And then, James, you gave a lot of color on plastic and I just have been thinking a lot about on the consumer awareness and preference changes and how quickly that seems to be building momentum, particularly in the U.S. So if you could just offer a perspective on how as a system you can sort of balance dealing with that, the consumer interest but also the cost that's implied in sort of changing that packaging mix?

I think I've been pretty consistent in the last year talking about this as being a top priority for me and at least for the team. We're very clear on the drivers to improve our free cash flow. I have a great team in place and frankly speaking the only surprise was that they made progress as fast as they have hitting it out of the park especially in the fourth quarter. As I look to the sustainability going forward, I see continued opportunities to improve the underlying fundamentals. Cash from operations should continue to improve. We've still got opportunities on working capital. We're not seeing much benefit in the comparative years on CapEx but over time that will be there. And we will have lower sort of transformation costs in the productivity arena particularly. For 2020, we do need to factor in a couple of special items. There is recycling of a special dividend from 2019 and some transition tax payments. On a two-year basis if you look at it, we're in the mid-to-high 80s and I expect us to continue to make progress upwards from there.

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,89,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Perhaps we'll be such generous into two questions as we kind of did two of Ali. On the plastics bit, Lauren, clearly consumer awareness is going on plastics in particular and packaging or consumer waste in general. For sure, it's going up U.S. and perhaps even further ahead places in Europe. So check, awareness is going up. Second thing that's happening is I think the emergence of a more profound investigation of what does it really mean. Certainly sometimes initially there's a danger, it becomes a philosophical question of plastic good or plastic bad whereas actually when you get into it, the first thing to realize is there are different types of plastics and some plastics have high value and are easily made part of the circular economy. Some have a very hard recycle and have very little value and then there's stuff in the middle. So what's happening now is that a kind of a more structured move towards, okay, what can we really do about it? And what happens is two objectives come together when stand back from plastic. And actually it then applies to plastic, aluminum, glass, cardboard, whatever packaging material they're talking about, two things comes together. How do we have zero waste and how in doing that do we have the lowest possible carbon footprint, because that's the other objective that's going to come back into the equation here. I think the plastics space started more on the waste side, but the two things are going to come together and the objectives are going to end up being how do we design a system that deliver the brands and beverages that people want with zero waste and a lower carbon footprint. And when you go down that road and you get into plastics, for example as a material, what you find is high-value plastics in which PET bottles are the preeminent high-value plastic. If you can get them back, they're fully recycled and fully reusable in beverage bottles, as we pointed out, we can have our first mark in the world, we're going to achieve a circular economy of getting the bottles back and making them back into plastic bottles, a fully circular economy in Sweden with our bottles and those recycled PET bottles have a lower carbon footprint than just one-way plastic bottles but also have a lower carbon footprint than cans or glass at least on today's technology. So actually if your objectives remain zero waste and lower carbon footprint, which is where I believe the conversation is going to move towards, then achieving a circular economy on PET is actually the best way to achieve that objective. Now there are as I said other types of plastic and we as a system have gone through the process of - the bottle has lots of value. There are other plastics we use like shrink wraps which don't - are much harder to recycle or have low value. So, for example, our Western European bottler is just going through a process of investing under the European single-use plastic directive to removal of that plastic on the supply chain and putting in cardboard. It cost a little bit more, but it can be accommodated within the business system. So we're starting to work on how do we eliminate low-value, super hard to recycle plastics? And then the bit in the middle, we're investing with companies - other people are doing it too - on innovation. Because what's needed there is some new technologies, enhanced recycling. We came out with an innovation last year. We call it the marine where we were able to take very dirty PET which doesn't fit in the normal stream, actually with enhanced recycling, chemical recycling, we're able to turn that back into food-grade PET. So I see the circular economy on clean PET bottles being the lowest carbon footprint and zero waste and that's the solution for today. New technologies coming in for the middle types of plastics will kind of complete the circular economy play and the system moving out of hard to recycle glasses. Now all of that if we do it collectively with peer manufacturers in beverages and other FMCG and retailers and put in place with governments the lowest cost collection of systems possible, this can all be accommodated within the business system going forward. And therefore we can continue to use a range of packaging vehicles for the consumer not forgetting that we are also one of the largest enterprises that have package-less dispensing between our fountain business, our Freestyle business, our Costa Express business, we provide a wide platform of bottle or can-less dispensing of beverages. And we're continuing to innovate with DASANI PureFill. So we will run a dual track system and make sure we can offer the consumer the beverages they want and achieve a future where we have zero waste and a lower carbon footprint.",,0.835

James, when you came onboard, you talked about changing the culture, trying to drive more agility, speed, accountability and certainly we're seeing strong results. But I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the cultural changes that you're actually doing, kind of the sustainability of that, perhaps have you adapted the compensation system?

Thank you.",,0.982
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,92,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Let me start with the culture piece and then come to the CMO piece. Absolutely what we said on the culture and simply put around really fundamentally driving a growth mindset and celebrating all that's great about the Coke culture and the Coke system culture to get us more growth oriented. And as I've said before, any large system, particularly a large successful system is predestined in a way to the effects of gravity to suck focus inwards the bigger and bigger it gets and the more successful it gets. And so it has to be pushed against the drive and external view what is the consumer doing, what do they really want, how are we going to help our customers grow the business? Without that, things will go wrong. And so that's been the focus of the culture shift to really drive that. It then goes along with the organizational strategy around empowerment and accountability and backing it up with compensation. I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that cash got included in the compensation in the last couple of years and we have done somewhat better in 2019 on cash. So it is about an organizational strategy, the various components working together to drive the end results which is about the growth mindset leads to a focus on growth which leads to better results. And as we think about that, switching over to the CMO question, we put in place the growth office with the purpose of providing more structure. We had spent a number of years expanding the portfolio into different categories with different brands we had not been disciplined enough about working out which ones were truly brands that offer the consumer compelling proposition and which were just bulking up. And we had to come in and be more disciplined. So the work that the growth office did with Francisco driving it to create the leader, challenger, explorer and the zombies and really get clear about what's working, what's not working and how do we administer structure to the portfolio in a more strategic way was a critical piece of getting more organized over the last couple of years. And now the next phase which is kind of why we've gone back to more of a Chief Market Officer structure is having put that strategic logic in place, we have to continue to excel on one of the four fundamental levers of the business. We talk about brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, having a sharper focus on the hard core of marketing is critical. Now we have a clear structure on how we want to approach the portfolio.",,0.994

And what have you learned about shelf placement in the other parts of the world that you're applying to the U.S.? And if you're generous also with me, can you please break down the 17% price/mix in LatAm into list price, Argentina benefit and better mix of single serve that you called out in Brazil and Mexico and how should we think about the region embedded in your 5% guidance globally? Thank you.",,0.979
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,98,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. Maybe I'll start with Latin America and exude generosity through the whole call. Argentina I think accounted for about three points of extra inflationary pricing within the Latin America number. So that would give you something in the kind of low teens for Latin America for the full year if you excluded Argentina and I think that's more consistent with what you see going backwards in time for price mix for Argentina. We don't break out the kind of single serve in Brazil and the other pieces. So I think if you believe that Argentina inflation is going to come down, then taking - seeing Latin America's price/mix go back or exclude that benefit would then be logical. In terms of Coke Energy, we're certainly making a strong effort in North America. It's kind of version 2.0 having done a 1.0 in a number of the international markets. And one of the things we learnt as we went into North America market is we wanted to move the flavor profile of the product closer to Coke, less citrusy, more Coke like. We think that's going to work well for the North America market and we'll be rolling that formula out in some of the round-one marketplaces. Certainly in terms of shelf space and execution into customers, we're very clear and we're looking to take space from the energy category from brands that are competitive to those carried by the Coke system, by which I mean I also include monitoring that among the Coke system. So we're looking to take from other competitors and generate space. So the strategy is clear. We're looking to expand the access to the energy category and we think Coke can do that. We're certainly giving it a go. And as you said, it's very early days and so we don't have any clear conclusions yet in the U.S. marketplace, but it certainly seems to have generated a lot of interest.",0.184548,0.975

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,102,Question,2020-01-30,4,2019,William Chappell,SunTrust,"Can you just - I realize it's still early, but any kind of thoughts of how coronavirus changes your plans in China, be it just current sales or plans to rollout Costa? And also maybe any update or reminder of kind of what SARS did to numbers, if anything, 10 years ago or 15 years ago?",,0.0
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,103,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Well, starting at the end, obviously China's economy was in a different place when SARS happened almost 10, 15 years ago. Net-net when seen on an annual basis, the effect was not particularly noticeable from a business point of view. Obviously, the human and health point of view is different, but from a business point of view SARS did not ultimately seem to make that much difference. It's worth noting the Chinese economy is much bigger and this could become more connected to the rest of the world. China accounts about 10% of our global volume, less on a profit and revenue basis but about 10% of our global volume. It is early days. Our focus is firstly our employees' safety. Secondly, to support efforts the Chinese government wants in accommodating what needs to be accommodated to help them deal with the crisis, whether that's making donations of product or money to help in the efforts which we've already done through the Coke Foundation, through the Coke system and through donation of product. And then thirdly, to worry about business continuity and recoverability or recoverability and then continuity. So far, of course, the short-term effects are the offices are closed, a good number of the factories are closed and so that's the current situation. There will be - there is an effort by of course the Chinese government there still has to be food and beverage available for the population, so we under the auspices of the Chinese government and their kind of crisis management reopening some of our manufacturing facilities to make sure we continue to produce our product for the population and get it distributed in a way that's not going to make the spread - be part of the spread. So it's way too early to tell what the impact in the short term is. And I think ultimately in the long run it will rebalance, as I said, number one priority is employee safety; number two is help support the efforts to contain the virus and manage the crisis; number three, ensure business can be recovered and to support continuity in the short term.",,0.982

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,106,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. We talked about that in the past in the context of looking at our overall balance sheet and making sure that we are fully utilizing our asset base in the most efficient and effective manner. We continue to look at all aspects of the balance sheet, including our equity investments. It's a thoughtful process. It requires us to work closely with our partners which we are doing. We've had a couple of initiatives in 2019 that you're aware of and we've continued to do what's right for both our balance sheet but also for the businesses that we're invested in. Overall, it's not a material matter when it comes to our future cash flow trends and we'll continue to update you as we make progress.",0.7932437,0.9

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,108,Question,2020-01-30,4,2019,Carlos Laboy,Bear Stearns,"Good morning, everyone. On price/mix, can you comment on the roll of bottler digital platform advances for driving things like directive initiatives by point of sale? Where do you see the system advancing these digital capabilities further as you look out to 2020, 2021, and how important do you think these are as you look ahead?",,0.762
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,109,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. The ability to drive RGM absolutely can be made more powerful and to some extent will have a greater reliance on our ability to capture, use analytics to generate the insights for the further round, not just the overall aggregate price packaging but ability to work with customers kind of one-on-one in a segmented way to drive results. So no question that the increasing availability and generalability, if I can just invent that word, of data is going to create a competitive advantage for the Coke system for the bottlers to be able to drive revenue growth management and engage with customers on how to drive it. And then ultimately at some point that will bring in AI and all sorts of other tools, but I see that as all under version 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 of driving RGM and then RGM is a competitive advantage for the Coke bottlers and the Coke system overall.",1.9953081,0.967

KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,111,Question,2020-01-30,4,2019,Sean King,,"Hi. Good morning. How are you thinking about the margin impact of the innovation pipeline you have planned for the U.S. in 2020?

And in that light, any insight you can provide on the pricing and promotional strategy for the rollout of those different products would be great?",,0.788
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,112,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Not a lot of news on that. I think the margin impact for both energy and AHA should be overall very positive. I think what we need to most is take a look at the overall innovation pipeline. It links back to what James referred to earlier. It is one of the key drivers of both sustainable top line growth and then also conversion into the kind of margin expansion that we're committed to for the future. I think with the shift from being volume centric to value centric, we've seen our business units at our R&D centers readjust their focus on making sure that what comes out of the pipeline on an overall basis has got the right margin characteristic. So a lot of good work underway and I think we're - you'll see that being reflected in the overall output from innovation not just in North America but in the rest of the world.",0.4857935,0.895

John, I wanted to come back and drill down a bit in the area of productivity. So earlier in the call you said the organization is clear on the opportunity with respect to free cash flow; and congratulations, you've done a great job since taking over. But similarly, is the organization clear on the opportunity regarding productivity and this is something you intend to quantify for the investment community? Do you believe that the incentive structure at The Coca-Cola Company reflects this opportunity beyond just operating income targets, maybe something more specific at the business unit level? And then strategically maybe discuss the role of productivity as an enabler to fund reinvestment to sustain a top line growth? Thank you.",,0.993
KO-2019-Q4-2020-01-30,115,Answer,2020-01-30,4,2019,John Murphy,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Thank you. Yes, productivity is a critical part of the equation going forward. It's embedded in our long-term growth algorithm and so it's an area of particular focus for us here and around the world. I think it's important to highlight that for the last two to three years, it's offered an outsized portion of the expansion due to the reset of the cost base driven by the transformation plans that are being underway. As we look to the future and I think we talked about this at the Scotiabank conference in 2019, and similar to the cash flow conversation we're very clear on the levers that we have at our disposal to influence the productivity agenda, and it's got to be linked to the overall growth agenda as well. We are very clear on how they relate to the different businesses that we have; the core business, our Global Ventures group and our bottling organization. And so the short answer is yes, it's very much embedded in the operational plan. It's very much a part of the overall compensation model and we expect to continue to make progress, as I said, to deliver on our overall algorithm as we go into 2020 and beyond.",1.3537769,0.971

In Asia Pacific, we grew organic revenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 7% volume growth for the segment as we focused on underserved consumption occasions.

Here, our results continued to mark steady progress driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen-measured channels. Strong revenue growth for our core sparkling soft drink brands continues to fuel and enable new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage portfolio.

Along with our focus on smaller packaging and premium innovation, year-to-date, we are growing trademark Coke revenue faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing calories, what we believe is a winning strategy for the future. Our innovation pipeline. Our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with the launch of Coke Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster, and we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category.",,0.989
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,17,Remarks,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The initial results are encouraging. In Spain, the first market where Coke Energy was launched, has already captured 2% share of the energy category modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for outlet as the market leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. We're taking everything we have learned and applying these insights as we rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 countries, and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available in 20 markets. Coke Energy, along with many of our other innovations, are being created to target specific occasions and need states but in very different ways, particularly as we grow our challengers and explorers. For example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from its success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink with zero added sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid-morning or afternoon energizing snack. With this, our focus on consumer-centric innovation, almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% 2 years ago.",,0.979

In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the bottler until we move through a period of political and economic change in the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn't changed.

One critical issue facing the world is plastic waste. In 2018, we announced our World Without Waste goals through recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We used approximately 30% recycled material in our packaging globally in 2018. We now have 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019. And importantly, our system is also working to improve collection.

We delivered another solid quarter with broad-based organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 6% with a healthy balance of price/mix and volume and a 1-point benefit from timing.

For the first half, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, and as James noted, about a point of this came from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. But after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance, and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit than we expected at the beginning of the year.",,0.971

KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,42,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me try and offer three thoughts, Steve. Firstly, I think we have in front of us a tremendous long-term opportunity in the beverage industry. I'd refer you back to one of the pages we've used in one of the investor decks with the two bottles, the one of the developed worlds and the one of the developing worlds. With the developed world is a small portion of the world's population, 20% of the population of the world. Yes, there, 3/4 of what they drink is a commercial beverage, but we still have a relatively small share of that in aggregate and we're gaining share. So, there's huge opportunity for value growth in the developed world.",,0.977
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,43,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And yet in the developing part of the world, which is 80% of the world population, only 1/4 of what they drink evolves from commercial beverage. And again, our share has lots of room for expansion. So, the first point is I would reunderline the long-term opportunity for growth of commercial beverages in the developed and the developing markets, and that's a huge opportunity in front of us.",,0.893
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,44,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second thought I would offer you is I think we're seeing not just momentum in the second quarter or the year-to-date, and yes, leave aside some of the timing benefits, but what we're seeing is a sustained set of results over if you want to take the last four quarters and you average out the unit cases and you average out the price/mix of the last four quarters to just give you a year, I think you get about two in volume and about three in price. And if you were to do the calculation, I think you'd end up with a three on price with or without BIG. So, I think you're seeing sustained momentum of the core business over a 12-month period. And perhaps even more encouragingly, that is now lapping a period where we were also in the band we were looking for, for our long-term growth model of 4% to 6%. So, we've now got 5% in round numbers lapping 5%. So, I think the momentum is now multiyear. I always encourage everyone to look at some multiquarter average given where we are in the supply chain and the timing effects. So long-term opportunities, and we're now building momentum that is called multiyear momentum.",,0.964
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,45,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I think to the question of how much BIG can affect that going forward, yes. Look, we've clearly given the BIG team a mission to grow the top line and the bottom line. I think the countries that did well this quarter are -- happened to be the countries where we own the parts of the bottling operation. So that obviously -- that obviously was very helpful. But BIG is centered in a number of countries that have long-term growth prospects. They're largely in the bottle but is only 1/4 commercial beverages. So, they have a lot of opportunity, and we've given them a clear mission to abandon the concept of the hospital ward. We should be aspiring for bottling operations we own to be just as good as all the other bottling operations, and obviously, we'll look to find the right owner at the right time. And therefore, yes, we should expect the BIG operations to do better in the coming years.",,0.971

And so, to zero in from that kind of broad controversy into the quarter, you provided this gross margin and operating margin bridge set of charts. Can you just aggregate please the ""underlying green,"" i.e., positive bar more in terms of cost savings, one, negative sales mix, maybe geographic mix and price/mix, really with an idea of trying to get us comfortable with the sustainability and maybe positive momentum in margins. And particularly this quarter, we saw SG&A as a percent of sales improve, but that overall controversy remains on the margins. And then if I might, just a very quick clarification.

I think we've been super clear on what we believe is happening on the operating margins and I think, clearly, there's a couple of things happening here.

KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,58,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think our messaging has been very clear: the mechanical changes to the operating income margin happened because of ins and outs, particularly of bottling operations given their very different cost structures and the acquisitions, and I think that's clear on the chart. And I think what you can clearly see is we continue to execute against our game plan to improve operating margins over time. We've been tracking on that towards the target that we had talked about, but given all the confusion, we've removed and had this bridge instead.",,0.439

It's clearly driven by the sum of the parts. We're getting improved pricing. Yes, some of those are in categories, which have higher cost of goods.

KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,60,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, against the question, will expansion of new categories cause the compression of the gross profit margin, we had previously said yes, it might be a little, but it will be offset by productivity. What you've seen in the first half is it's a wash. We've been able to drive the Coke franchise and the innovation and manage the portfolio such that the net impact on gross margin is a wash, which is a great result. And then obviously, we're getting some flow-through of our ongoing productivity efforts. Just because we haven't announced the new program, we are still focused on using resources effectively in the SG&A on the back -- in the back office and investing wisely with the marketing such that this operating leverage is flowing through into the margin.

I mean just starting on the U.S., I mean we haven't -- the markets we haven't announced yet, I mean, we're not going to announce until we're ready. Clearly, we're thinking about the U.S. market and when would be the right timing for Coke Energy. Clearly, it's a big market and a big opportunity. I think, ultimately, the way I would look at it is we've launched in a number of markets and our approach is essentially to launch in markets where we know we have capabilities and a lot of strength and a strong Coke franchise, and therefore, we think would represent a robust good opportunity and that should give us an idea of what -- how well we could do. So, Spain would be an example of that. We have a great franchise in Spain. We have a great on-premise business there with the cafés and restaurants. We have strong relationships with the modern trade and a very strong bottler. So, we know that if we do well there, that in strong markets, then we know what that would represent.",,0.994

And that'll give us, in a way, a set of learnings on the 1.0 of launching Coke Energy from which we can learn. And purely from a rollout perspective and a tactical perspective in something like this, it would probably suit us to have those learnings and have a 2.0 for the U.S., whatever tweaks that may be, whether it's taking the formulation tweaks and the graphic tweaks and the marketing mix tweaks and the execution approach, because it's all about accelerating the learning cycle and driving that forward.",,0.743

Every time we've done it, we've tried to make sure we learn from the cycle of the 1.0 or 2.0 before we go to the next set of countries.

KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,79,Question,2019-07-23,2,2019,Kevin Grundy,Jefferies,"Congratulations on strong first half results. James, a question on North America. So broadly, three consecutive quarters where volumes have been negative but not very consistent with the industry with pricing that's been put into place. But I guess the other key topic, of course, is that your key competitors ramped investment spending that started last year. This is continuing behind key brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Arguably, to some degree, the strategic changes that they're making in North America will really be sort of a key watch point for investors whether this turnaround is, indeed, going to be successful. So broadly, if you could discuss sort of the competitive environment. And then the second part of that, whether you're comfortable with current investment levels in your portfolio going forward.",,0.936
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,80,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I mean, firstly, I think I would say that if competitors are investing in the category behind branding and rational pricing and trying to create value, that is ultimately good news. Yes, it means we have to be on the top of our game, but it's better to be in an industry where there's more consumer demand being created than not. So, I think that's a very important starting point that we think will be beneficial ultimately to the total beverage business in the U.S.",1.7153581,0.952
KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,81,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In terms of the volume, I mean, the volume was slightly negative in the U.S. I think it's important to remember what we're trying to do in the U.S. business. We're focused on building the consumer engagement, and so a lot of what we've done, particularly in some of the sparkling brands, is have a focus on some of the smaller packages and drive for transaction growth even if that means the volume's flat. We'd love a little bit of positive. But if it's a little bit of negative, that hasn't concerned us because we think we can stabilize the volume in the long term and have the value be created ultimately through the price/mix. So, more price versus volume. Obviously, like to see volume a little bit positive in the case of the U.S., but really sticking with the strategy of driving the consumer interactions, heavy lean on smaller packages. Of course, the portfolio piece that goes with that is some of the Zero Sugars and the reformulation.",,0.877

The competitive set, we can face a set of local competitors in Japan, which operate in a multicategory, not just soft drinks and sparkling and stills, but wine, beer and spirits going to the same customers, and in the case of the Lemon-Do, competing for an occasion and a consumer which heavily overlaps here.

I think we've seen the benefit across a whole series of places doing that a little bit better, whether it's Asia Pacific or some of the parts of Europe and Africa. So, I think it's the flow-through of execution, but it just wasn't one place. As I talked about on the first question, I really do think of the first half more as a 5 than a 6 and there are lots of ways of getting at that answer whether you like the simple rule of thumb or just taking the average of the unit cases and the average of the price/mix and that gets you five, whether it's two quarters or four quarters or you can get into the minutia or the detail on the timing of the Brexit, gallons and all this sort of stuff.

KO-2019-Q2-2019-07-23,96,Answer,2019-07-23,2,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. No, Japan was a detractor there in this quarter and for some very specific reasons. Firstly, in the natural disasters last year, one of our important bottling -- one of the important manufacturing facilities of our bottle was knocked out completely last year. So, we lost capacity just as we were starting to grow in the Japanese business, and they're working very hard to install new capacity. They're doing a great job in doing it, but one cannot defeat the laws of physics.

So that's a big deal. And whilst our competitors did not follow us immediately, they did follow us by the end of the quarter. So of course, there was -- the price of leadership in those circumstances is we suffered a little bit of a volume hit in the second quarter.

We focus on getting the consumers and growing customer value in each and every country and so there is very much a focus on getting that to work and I think over the last few years you've seen accelerated performance of us able to drive the industry grow and capture share within that and that's a starting point of value creation for the Coke company to work on that and making sure the operating margins of how we do that are all the same or better, such that we turn that revenue growth into profit growth at the local level.",0.2020644,0.988

I see the taxes change that you're describing I don't really know why. So I know you've tried to explain in bits and pieces but there are a lot of moving parts and I want to understand the moving parts. I don't want to wait until 10:30.

We started off last year, well obviously we had the long term growth model of 4% to 6% on the top line. We've been delivering within that range for the last six quarters. We are being prudent in our outlook for 2019 given the multiple reductions in global economic growth outlook for 2019 and our own experience in some of the emerging and developing markets.

Operating leverage is not just driven by productivity, but by better work on the portfolio, and you see that flowing through obviously with some of the tailwinds from the acquisitions and the divestitures. A small piece, so that we're getting excellent leverage from our revenue growth into our operating income growth at the 10% to 11%. Obviously the currency is where it is.

Finally down to EPS through the higher tax rates which the Fed has taken through the year and through the changes in the tax rates.

I understand that 2019 underlying profit outlook is solid ex-items if in fact you deliver it. But I think you had intimated before that you were really looking to drive earnings growth even in the face of FX pressures. So obviously we've talked about 2019 guidance already, but as we think about the earnings trajectory post 2019 is it more in line with the long term algorithm that you guys have outlined plus or minus currency or do you still think there's some levers that you can pull over time that even if FX continues to be unfavorable, you can hit your earnings growth targets?

We are committed to growing the earnings of the company. I mean, in simple terms, the earnings of the company are the fuel to pay the dividends of the company and drive the stock price and reinvest back in the business. So without dollar increased earnings of EPS it is not going to be a growth company and therefore we reaffirmed the long term growth model at some of our previous investor presentations, the 4 to 6 on revenue and the growth in EPS.

But as you look out into the future, we absolutely expect to keep focusing on coming back to the long term growth mode. Now, to the question well what happens if the dollar always gets stronger? Well, then that simply put assuming that there still is a global trading system that will export inflation to the other parts of the world. And therefore, if we enter some very long extended period of dollar strengthening then we will logically expect to see higher pricing in other parts of the world that will compensate for some prolonged ongoing strengthening of the dollar.

James, for USA good job and I'm actually my gift to you is I am going to ask Kathy and/or John a question, related to the to the free cash flow guidance for next year. It implies another year of about two thirds conversion of net income to free cash flow which is below the company's 90% plus target. So I'm assuming there's still a good number of structural costs flowing through with respect to refranchising and the recent acquisitions, but can you help us get underneath those dynamics at all and paint a picture of what it will take to get back to that or get to that 90% plus conversion ratio on a consistent basis and can we can we look to 2020 to be that year of inflection?",,0.972

One is the acquisition of costs and some CapEx related to investing for the future there. Secondly, with BIG taking on the Philippines and then thirdly, we have a couple of strategic initiatives in the digital arena and in our concentrate business to invest in 2019.",0.2200277,0.832

One area of focus is going to be to drive greater efficiencies in working capital productivity. Secondly, it would be to reduce the cash flow impact from the timing of payments of onetime items related to restructuring and re-franchising.

And so we think that has been very successful. Clearly, we're still working on our beverages Africa, in terms of refranchising started it has obviously been slower than anyone would have liked.

Obviously, we'll be thinking about what's the right strategic direction for that part of the world. But the ongoing, you know curation of refranchising is not refranchising for the sake of franchising. It's in the service of creating a stronger and more energized bottling system that is aligned set of partners with the company to drive our collective business with more growth and with better margins into the future and that takes different forms and places and of course we allocate capital within the process whether it's owning bottlers or having stakes in bottlers. We drive that process with the objective of using capital as and when necessary, sometimes yes, sometimes no, to get the most energized bottling system out there and bringing new partners in.

At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets. We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns. During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated. Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter. And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid February, trends have improved since then. We're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March 2019 prior to the pandemic.",,0.974

It's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world. Many markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions. Looking around the world in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers.

Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform on the Costa. We're expanding ready to drink coffee in China and taking portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan. We're also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe and Latin America and across markets globally later this year. The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca Cola original taste. These were influenced by consumer insights and are focused on constant improvement.

Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report. Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy.

When you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step change in performance. Last quarter, we said that despite rising commodity environments, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021, given our hedged positions. While this continues to be the case, we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PT, metals, and other packaging materials that impact us as well as our bottling partners.

KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,40,Question,2021-04-19,1,2021,DaraMohsenian,,"Hey, guys. So clearly top line growth in Q1, and it recovered to a greater extent than the market expected. You guys mentioned a good start to the year with sequential improvement. So, I guess, a, can you just discuss volume trends in March in markets where restrictions have loosened and mobility has picked up such as the US, maybe contrast that with the markets where restrictions are still in place and what that portends going forward? And then, b, totally understand it's a very fluid environment. But with March volume already back to 2019 levels with the topline upside in the quarter, can you just help me understand the unchanged full-year topline outlook? And is it just that it's early given the volatility and we only have one quarter in the books to become more positive on the full year? Just sort of trying to understand your mindset on the full year revenue guidance relative to the Q1 upside. Thanks.",,0.772
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,41,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"Sure. Thanks Dara. So firstly, the first quarter was strong. Absolutely, we gained momentum and we achieved that good momentum in the first quarter, which is really the fruition of the emerging stronger plan we set out a year ago, saying we wanted to get back to 2019 levels well ahead of the economy by gaining more share, more customers, better system economics. And I think that's what you're starting to see happen in the first quarter. And obviously, we've been driving that by focusing on the brands and on the innovation. And the bottlers have been executing in the marketplace, and it's certainly heartening to see us get back to 2019 volume levels in March.",,0.872
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,42,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"And we did all of that whilst doing -- finishing the implementation of the reorganization, sothe employees on the company side were able to both deliver the results and stand up the new organization with the operating units and platform services and really hit the ground running. So, I think it is actually a super creditable performance in the first quarter. Secondly, the downhill and the question about guidance. I mean, ultimately, it's early and it's not early, just in a normal sense, it's early in the context of the pandemic. Also, breaking the news today is that weekly new cases of COVID have hit an all-time peak.",,0.979
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,43,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"So while vaccinations are rising in many countries, US, UK, et cetera, the flipside is there's actually a new high in terms of cases, obviously a number of developing markets but also Europe as well continental Europe as well. So, the visibility into the downhill is very much linked to the trajectory of the pandemic, and as it relates to our business, the trajectory of the lockdowns, very clearly as we've talked on previous quarters, lockdowns because we have half our business in away from home are impacted directly by the degree of lockdown, and though there are still lockdowns coming on, a number in Europe, some of the developing markets, conversely as markets start to open, it's worth remembering. It's not an on/off switch. There's a phasing of how markets tend to reopen. And that's true to the US, so for example in the US, the fountain volumes were still negative in March because whilst people are going out to restaurants and there's more mobility, it's not back to what it was. The occupancy levels of offices are nowhere near a 100%, and so reopening is not an on/off switch.",,0.142
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,44,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"There's a rebuilding and there's a series of phases of reopening. And so, that's a very important factor and it's somewhat unpredictable with the downhill. So it's too early to call not in a business sense, but in a lockdown and reopening sense. And the reality is that there are more cases now than they were a while ago. So, we still feel very confident in our guidance on the top and the bottom line, but there's a lot of managing left to do and we're certainly focused on giving ourselves the flexibility and agility to be able to do that. And which leads me to my third point, which I think is worth making. Unlike normal times, one should not automatically assume that more revenue is always going to flow straight down to the bottom line. Much as we did in 2020, we are going to be very judicious and focused on investing where we believe reopening and demand is coming back and not investing, if we don't think the response in the marketplace is there.",,0.0
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,45,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"So you're going to see as we go through 2021, we will be looking at both levers. If we see that demand is coming in at the kind of the higher end, there's more reopenings happen more quickly for whatever reason, and revenue start to accelerate, we're also likely to reaccelerate the restitution of the marketing spend. Conversely, if for whatever reason revenue starts to look a little weaker, then we are likely to hold back on some of the marketing. So, I think it's important as you think about the rest of the year that you don't think of it as normal times one has to think about how we are using the resources judiciously and wanting to invest to drive growth and get back to normal.",,0.883

John, I wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made relative to inflation, and I guess kind of thinking about it past '21 and into '22, just given the recent trends, which have elevated pretty meaningfully across a lot of inputs really across our whole coverage universe. If that stays in effect for '22, can you talk a little bit about what you can do working with the system with the bottlers to try to manage that inflation, and really beyond revenue management? So just how much, what type of actions can you take in terms of procurement, maybe finding inefficiencies that exist between the Coca-Cola company and the bottling systems, just really trying to understand, in a scenario where inflation stays meaningfully elevated in a way that we haven't seen in a real long time, just what types of things you can contemplate to try to help the system manage that inflation.",,0.959

And one that with our bottling partners around the world, we're looking as a very holistic manner, managing inflation is not new to the system. And it's one it's an area that needs to be looked us locally and working closely in partnership with our bottlers. As you're saying the inflationary pressures, particularly surrounding some of our key commodities, looks like it is going to be more of a headwind in '22, '21 we are, as we said, in the release pretty well covered and in good shape. And so when you think about the actions we take, first and foremost, I think it is important to highlight that as an over arching principle around the world, we typically look to take pricing in line with inflation.",,0.743

Secondly, while, I know you mentioned beyond RGM, I do think it's important to reinforce the value that RGM brings to being able to execute a pricing strategy in the most relevant and meaningful fashion locally. And so that will continue to be a key priority. Thirdly, on the things that we can do on the productivity area, I would point to our supply chain particularly with our bottling partners in the last 6 to 12 months coming through the pandemic and indeed coming out of us that the level of engagement we've had with our -- within the system unlocking value in the supply chain through greater efficiencies, has been phenomenal. And I would expect that momentum to continue into the rest of this year and into 2022. We have had over the last number of years, the benefits of leveraging our cross enterprise procurement group, a group of people that work on behalf of the entire system around the world that are able to leverage the global scale of the system.

KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,53,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"Sure, Nik, a few examples. One, I think John's already mentioned, the cash flow, we struggle for many years to get up into best-in-class cash conversion, or working capital. And the work that has been done by the finance network has produced a great result. And that's clearly flowing through not just in terms of the kind of theoretical, amount of days working capital, but the actual cash coming into the company in the first quarter, which was a really strong result, and then something that we have struggled to do in the past. Another example with -- we have been rolling out a global campaign on Sprite, which has got excellent early traction, in terms of consumer engagement, in terms of purchase intent. And that was developed by the category leads and the key operating units, and has been rolled out across the world, something that we were unable to do or unable to convince ourselves to do historically.",,0.718

KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,57,Question,2021-04-19,1,2021,LaurenLieberman,,"Great, thanks so much. Good morning. And this is probably a good lead in from all three of the last questions. But I want to talk a little bit about profitability because it was interesting to me that I think margins in almost every division outside of EMEA were comfortably ahead of where they were in the first quarter of 2019. And knowing that COVID comps weren't necessarily a dynamic for all regions in the first quarter of last year, if I still benchmark back to '19, the profitability improvements are significant. And so I was curious, how much knowing James your comments and wanting to invest to support recovery is a very important dynamic. But how much do you think of that margin improvement that we're seeing. So, at this point is tied to these broad range of cost management initiatives across the board and RGM, inclusive, versus timing of marketing, the need to put back in and continue funding the business, and it may be different region to region, of course, as well. Thanks.",,0.0
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,58,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"Yes. Thanks, Laura, look, clearly, the reinvestment of marketing is going to vary somewhat by region in 2021 for the reasons I outlined in that answer to the first question. So I think it's important as you think about margins to recognize that 2021 is also going to be a somewhat a typical year, there will be markets around the world where we judge the situation such that we don't have a normal level of marketing. And so that does tend to favor margins, operating margins at that point in time. And so it is important to break it apart and look at it by the different regions. We certainly are not coming out with some numerical margin target for many of the same reasons that we remove the previous target. And we are focused ultimately on growing the business. And embedded in our long-term growth model is an implicit assumption that we can slowly or steadily perhaps better said, improve margins over time, because there is a lot of efficiency work going on within the cost of goods sold, within the DME, particularly the non working part of the DME, we've got a lot of focus on the agency roster and how we spend the money we spend before we even gets to see the consumer. And obviously, we've done the network organization, which was about making us better able to support the growth aspirations, but it is also more efficient organization. And so all those things will go into the mix. And it would be remiss of me to not include the impact of RGM. Because to the extent that we can leverage RGM, that also helps on a gross margin, and ultimately operating income margins. So we will be pulling all those levers as we go through 2021. But again, it won't be a fully normal year in every region. And so you will see some of these strange effects.",,0.813

Clearly, you can look at the digital transformation in terms of our engagement with consumers. And there are some, good examples of progress, China, which is started the year very strongly not just compared to 2020 but compared to 2019. It's been a much bigger shift into digital engagement with consumers or even in Japan with our own Coke On apps that we use to connect people to the vending machines and the cashless options and a large uptick in monthly active consumers. So there is a great deal of progress being made in terms of how we engage through digital media, how we engage directly with consumers in a digital relationship that's helping there, the system I used, I talked about the example of buying materials with digital platforms.

And we've seen sequential progress over the last few quarters. But I guess I'm curious whether that trend back to 2019 levels have been relatively smooth on a global basis, or there's been more volatility underneath the service than we may appreciate looking at the headline numbers. So maybe if you could just frame for us how performance versus 2019 has trend over the past few months.

And then as we adapted the business, and really drove what we were doing, then, we sequentially got better. So kind of we fell into the hole, I think it was like minus 25 or something in April last year, and then it was negative teens, and then negative single digits, slowly improving through the rest of 2020 and then coming into 2021. Obviously, we then cycling the bad year, but if we compared to 2019, it got better as we went from January in February, which was still below the '19 levels. And obviously March was above, I mean, April has started well. It's obviously they are going to be the weirdest month because recycling something very low. I think most importantly, I would refer you back to the comment I made the second thing I said relative in the first answer, which is just because March has gone back to the level and just because April has started well, one week, there's no guarantee that that is then some kind of trend that is in the bank.",,0.859

So in a sense, April last year was the worst because you had the most number of countries, most, the highest degree of synchronization of lockdowns globally and I think this idea of saying the recovery will be asynchronous, is we already see that in the first half, you've got countries where the vaccine levels are going up. And the reopening is occurring, US, UK, China for examples. And yet you've got countries going in exactly the opposite direction with cases shooting up, and more levels of lockdown.

KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,92,Question,2021-04-19,1,2021,LaurentGrandet,,"Yes, very nice pronunciation as well. So good morning, everyone. Yes, so I'd like to focus on emerging markets. So you said in your prepared remark that the volume case is correlated to the consumer mobility driven by vaccination rates. So, as I call into the video show, I mean, vaccination rates should be about 70% by the end of the year in developed market, but sadly, just about 20% in emerging markets. So should we consider then that emerging markets would be slower to recover? And really, probably, if you can provide some significant thought there, and maybe some granularity between that between regions? Thank you.",,0.778
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,93,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"Sure. So, I think, as you say, clearly, the vaccination rates in the developed markets are going to be ahead of the developing markets for the duration of this year. The critical factor to add to that is the market response to the level of cases or the low vaccination rates in the developing markets, because the thing that impacts our business most directly is the degree of lockdown. And so it's the response to the level of cases of the COVID and the resulting lockdowns, rather than necessarily directly the level of vaccination, because there are countries where the level of vaccination is low, because they had a strong lockdown, and then kind of lock the country up, say, Australia, whatever, then they've started to reopen. So the key factor to look for is the degree of lockdown and think through for that market, what's likely to happen, connected, of course, to the level of vaccinations, but also to the level of cases and what the policy response in the country is likely to be. And there'll be countries where I think, frankly, and unfortunately, they don't have the wherewithal and the fiscal capacity to implement large lockdowns, even if they not got all the vaccines that they want.",,0.296

KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,96,Question,2021-04-19,1,2021,BillChappell,,"Thanks, good morning. Hey, just want to follow up. And this is fairly near term and acute to the US, but I'm just trying to understand kind of the commentary of how you're looking at the business in that. I mean, it seems that the US will be different in kind of the reopening of everywhere else. So high majority of the population will be inoculated in the next 30 days, just as schools are getting out just as the weather's getting good. You have kind of sporting events talking about full capacity in June. I mean, are you -- is that a scenario you're prepared for and the bottling network is prepared for if the business, the on-premise business just explodes? And or do you really think that this is just going to be kind of go from phase two to phase three in May in phase four in June and slowly going to open up over the summer?",,0.361
KO-2021-Q1-2021-04-19,97,Answer,2021-04-19,1,2021,JamesQuincey,,"What I think the phases are going to exist, Bill, there are just going to happen very quickly in the US. So if I look at what's already happening I put eating and drinking in the evening in kind of phase one. I mean, those that bit of the away from home was trending negative, in volume strongly negative in volume in January and February. And as the reopening happened, it jumps up in March. And as you say, as school, as education and at work opens, both of which are still running negative in March, I think they're going to jump up again. So what I think we're going to see, as the US completes its kind of rapid vaccination is a quick succession of the phases rather than a drawn out set of the phases. Other parts of the world where the vaccination programs are slower, then I think you'll see a more gradual phasing of what happens.",,0.987

We had looked at our innovation pipeline, and while we had done a lot, we had some inefficiency in it.

I think the answer really is rooted in our belief in the sustainability of our long term growth algorithm. And as you know, embedded into that algorithm is an assumption that over time we can and we will continue to expand margins. I think any given year needs to be taken in the context of that longer term perspective. 2020, as you say, it was a particularly unusual year, and it afforded us the opportunity to under the umbrella of never waste a crisis to drive greater efficiency and to have a bump in our operating margin performance for 2020.",1.0800751,0.911

How that compares versus what you originally expected, presumably it's better than expected with the raised full year top line guidance? But how that impacts your strategy going forward and maybe also what you see is the lasting changes in consumer behavior in some of those markets?",0.6465436,0.799

It's certainly moved to a phase like lot of the other markets where there's high levels of vaccination where the COVID, the most serious parts of the COVID are affecting, mainly the unvaccinated, as well as some of the vulnerable.

Firstly, consumers, as we've talked before on these calls, we've always believed that humans are social creatures. And that once the restrictions come down and the panorama of the virus allows people with confidence to go out that they will go back out all of the away-from-home channels.

Our business in Mexico has actively adjusted to the -- to a more challenging economic environment, shifting the portfolio towards affordability with a push on returnable packaging.

We saw a strong marketplace performance driven by innovation in our sparkling portfolio and improving performance in stills. We also continue to gain share.

This put more than 2 points of pressure on concentrate sales in the quarter, and this was partially offset by a corresponding price/mix benefit as our Brazilian business revenue per case is lower than the company average. We are also cycling the timing of certain deductions in the third quarter of last year, which was a slight benefit to price/mix in the quarter. However, no impact on the year-to-date performance.

First, we have an additional day in the fourth quarter, which adds about 1 point of revenue growth. Second, we expect an estimated 2 point headwind to top line growth, biggest factor being the reduction in inventory levels by our European bottlers. You may recall that in the first quarter, price/mix and concentrate shipments benefited from those bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit.

So John, looking ahead, I think the currency outlook for 2020 is less severe than a lot of investors feared. But I guess, the question is what levers do you feel you have to offset such FX impacts in terms of managing to dollar-based EPS and cash flow. My read is that in the past, the company leaned more on financial levers and hedging to try to work through FX headwinds, whereas now you think you can lean a little bit more on operating levers, like productivity and realized price/mix. But is that right? I just love a little bit more color if possible as to how you're thinking about it and, more importantly, how we should all think about your flexibility, especially to the extent that FX volatility and, I hope this isn't the case, but if it continues to get worse.",,0.777

First of all, you're correct in that the outlook, as we go into 2020, it's an easier picture to paint given what I just described in the call. Secondly, I think it's important to emphasize that our overall growth algorithm continues to start with an objective to win locally in all of our markets around the world and to take the appropriate actions to be able to do that on a sustained basis.

Yes, let me start just to emphasize year-to-date, the strong cash flow is driven by underlying growth. We're cycling some taxes that we paid in the prior year. We're getting the benefit from the -- from working capital and from the -- a lowering of our onetime restructuring payments. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see the -- our capital expenditures finish the year in line with our previous guidance, actually just a little bit lower. I think we started at $2.4 billion. We're down to $2.2 billion. And the timing of a number of the projects we have is actually scheduled for the fourth quarter.

Free cash flow, look, we've been pretty clear as we've gone around, which is we have a dividend coverage, which is not where we wanted to be. We set ourselves a target of expanding that, but also made a clear point that it would clearly be our intent to see the dividend continue to grow. So we would like to see EPS track for multiple periods ahead of the dividend growth and obviously have the cash flow grow faster than the earnings. From where we are now, that -- we need some runway to get to a more comfortable point. So of course, when we come to our guidance for 2020 next year, we'll be clear on what we're doing, but I don't think we are likely to have a programmatic increase until there's substantially more flexibility.",,0.988

So Coke Energy, obviously, we've launched it in sort of 20-plus countries around the world so far in 2019. And I think we've got some excellent learnings. It's resonated -- some things have resonated in some places. We've got some learnings on things we need to improve. We've been able to build that into the -- a sort of 2.0 version that we'll be rolling out in the U.S. I think the U.S. marketplace, in order to really drive towards a strategy that brings new consumers into the energy category, we're moving the flavor profile closer to Coke. Plans -- we'll save some of the bells and whistles of the plans for a later date, so that a very clear approach in the U.S. to drive additional growth for the energy category by taking the product closer in flavor to Coca-Cola Classic. And then in the rest of the world where we have launched it in some of those markets, we'll be building on the learnings to date and evolving next year. And we see an opportunity to play a role for Coke Energy in the energy category and within the Coke franchise to bring some new consumers and some new relevance to the trademark.",,0.986

KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,63,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think it's largely the economic cycle, especially in the case of Latin America. I mean there's no doubt that there's been a difference in the last 10 years than the previous 10 years where, prior to financial crisis, there was more creation in the middle ground. And over the last 10 years, there's been a section of society in -- all around the world that have felt under pressure, the lower income end. And more of the wealth has been generated at the top -- while income has been generated at the top. So you've seen, in the last 10 years, in general, across many industries a bifurcation growth in both the top end of the luxury end and growth in the value end. And so yes, there is a piece here, in general, of a spreading out of the pricing spectrum in categories based on that trend. But I think, in the case of Latin America and Mexico that we've talked about, this is very much the kind of the pressure that some of these economies have been under lately and a doubling down on affordability. And the reason we've been out there is because we have an infrastructure that's very much a set up to be able to serve the needs of those with less income.",,0.714

And what I'm interested in learning is in terms of what's going on with the business, is it primarily share gains from your competitors? Or are you recruiting new customers to the brand? I'm particularly interested in how the brand is doing with consumers, let's say, under the age of 30 or 20, whatever number you want to take and to what extent you're able to continue to keep the brand very vibrant with the younger consumers.",,0.951
KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,66,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I mean I think, firstly, clearly, part of this is a revitalization of the sparkling business. It's clear that the strategy of making Coke the brand relevant with marketing, with innovation, of getting it in formats that are more on target for consumers, whether that be the Zero Sugar or the smaller packages is part of getting growth to be in the sparkling soft drinks category. And I think you can see that and as a demonstration of what is going on with Coke. So I mean in a way, it's a formula that's always been true and is true around the world. You need innovation, you need marketing, you need relevance, you need packaging, you need execution and you need to be able to engage. And I think what you're starting to see is, yes, some reconsideration of the category by whatever age you want to take it down to, let's call it loosely, the millennials of the sparkling category. Has it flip-flopped overnight? No, it hasn't, but I think you're starting to see that if you bring relevantly marketed innovation for the right occasion to people, then they will engage.",,0.964

I mean you announced the launch of Coke Energy in the U.S. from January 1 with 4 SKUs in total, 2 more than in Europe and at a price point where it's just in the middle between Red Bull and Monster and not any more aligned with Red Bull.

KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,72,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I mean I think the two most obvious learnings, one I mentioned that I'll just repeat, which is to bring the formula of Coke Energy closer to Coke Classic. The energy category in the U.S. is much more developed than many of the other markets. And therefore, we are clearly taking an approach of trying to bring new consumers into the category rather than competing for the current ones. And we believe that based on our experiences in the launch markets and our research in the U.S. that doing so with a formula closer to Coke will be more effective.",,0.891
KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,73,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the pricing, clearly, the structure of the pricing and the relative weights of competitors at price points in the U.S. is different to Europe. And therefore, we've chosen to go in that -- in a slightly different direction or slightly more balanced starting point with a broader portfolio of SKUs. Obviously, we're looking for shelf visibility by having the full packages of the 4 variants. And that's kind of part of what, of course, is a learning from Coke Energy, but actually that's true in many other categories, that you need to have some standout especially if the shelf has a lot of SKUs in it already. I mean if you go to some of the markets where we launched around the world and the energy category is underdeveloped, 1 or 2 SKUs is enough to make an impact. But if you're in a more developed part of the world and there's more competitive offering, then you need a bit more presence. And I think that's what's driving that. And we'll launch in the U.S. And no doubt, we'll learn and we'll continue to evolve and focus on driving this as part of driving the Coke Trademark and the revitalization of the Coke Trademark, which has been very pleasing for all of us.",,0.9

KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,76,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I mean, firstly, yes, on a long-term basis, our business is correlated with GDP growth. So in the long run, that matters. Secondly, as I commented in the last quarter, there are some storm clouds in the sky. It -- have raining in a few places, but it's not -- there's not a total problem here. And I think the approach we're taking is to not overinvest our time looking in the news as to whether that is or isn't a global recession, but to focus on what we can do and to recognize that a lot of work has revitalized our top line. And our emerging bottom line has been up in the actions we've taken. And as we look around the world, whilst we can certainly find places where we do things really well, we are not a 10 out of 10 on any of the strategic initiatives all over the world.

KO-2019-Q3-2019-10-18,91,Answer,2019-10-18,3,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So clearly, price/mix is atypically higher. It is -- there's a little bit of Argentina in that. But actually, there's a quite a bit about cycling some of the inventory that was in Brazil from last year. So I think it's much more sensibly thought of as a 4% rather than a 6%. Still a excellent number for the quarter. And I think if you look back over what's been happening in '18 and '19, you're seeing more of a 3%. Obviously, it was a number we expected to come in.

Starting with the top line -- if I take for example in our -- in the core business, starting on our top line, innovation and increasing focus on premiumizing the innovation agenda, continuing to take advantage of the revenue growth management works that's -- that we -- that's been in its current iteration and expanding that around the world are examples of ways in which we can drive at the -- certainty at the gross margin line.

I mean we don't break out the percentage of the total business that mini cans is representing. But certainly, we are focused on driving that. Along with a series of other immediate consumption packages and smaller format packages, I think the mini cans being the most emblematic one, it grew 15% this quarter. So we're very pleased with this opportunity. We don't kind of, as a target to pursue, I said, well, it should be this percent of sales because, ultimately, if you're going to be consumer-centric, you will end up with the percentage that the consumers want to buy rather than what you want to sell. And so I think, philosophically, we focus most on making our brands or our packages or whatever bundle we're selling drive on the relevancy for the consumer. And if that's -- if we've got it right it, it will go up. And if we haven't, we have to go back to the drawing board. It is worth noting that mini cans do require some CapEx.

So going forward in quarters where it is significant, we will begin calling out hedging as a component of the overall currency impact so it's clear what gains or losses, we'll be cycling next year. For example in the first quarter of 2019, the currency impact to operating income was not materially affected by hedging activities and is primarily the result of a change in spot rates.

I wanted to start actually stepping back and talking about a bigger picture issue, just in terms of innovation. You've talked a lot about incremental innovation, I mean, how you work and how you introduce new products since you've taken over as CEO.

But what metrics are you specifically tracking when it comes to innovation? And maybe if you could, could you share some of those with us? Is it simply a matter of accelerating the number of new product innovations and introductions? And if so have those in fact accelerated?

I think one is to -- one metric that we track, and I think, we've put some numbers in our CAGNY presentation if I remember correctly, is looking at the contribution of innovation to overall volume or revenue growth or gross margin growth. So just tracking quite simply what was existing and what was new and what's contributing to the base. And that is useful to us not just to know what's new and what's existing, but on the thesis that the most important thing is to work out how to stay relevant there are innovations which are about new products, but there are innovations about marketing and packaging, which is all aimed to help us stay relevant.",0.8004379,0.879

It needs to be also seen as the packaging and the marketing. So we do measure the narrow, which is the product but we're also [interested] in the broad.

And so we're measuring there how many of the leaders are growing faster than personal consumption. Are they expanding their leadership position? How many of the challengers are gaining a decent amount of value share each year, because if they don't gain a decent amount of value share each year, they'll never arrive at being leader. And how many of the explorers are growing double-digits? We called out in the scriptures then that with half the explorers are growing double-digits, so there was only one-third last year.

As I mentioned in my remarks, the underlying margin expansion of what's 30 basis points in gross margin was led by EMEA.

So James, I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more color just in terms of your organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. I think in the fourth quarter call, you talked about some of the cautions around some of the macroeconomic volatility in markets like Middle East and Argentina. It seems like first quarter certainly came in a little bit better even setting aside some of the timing noise. So how are you thinking about the 4% number?

It looked pretty strong in the quarter, notwithstanding some of the gross margin impact and FX impact. What's underlying that in particular given a little bit of detail John a moment ago?

One, it does reflect the integration of the new businesses, but it's offset by currency and the structural impact. So, when you look at the comparisons take those into account.

I think firstly, the way we are seeing the opportunities for innovation in a product sense is in a way at the blurring edge or partly at the blurring edge with some of the categories. So the opportunity to have a Coke and coffee variant of Coca-Cola is really at that juncture of what are the benefits that people see in Coke versus what are the benefits they look for in coffee, especially perhaps in some of the markets where the occasions are less well-developed. Said another way, in the developed economies three-quarters of what people drink is already a commercial beverage. So they have a certain view as to what drinks go for what and what occasions.

First of all, we -- when you look at why we do it in the first place and why we've taken the approach, we've taken, we know we have U.S. cash outgoings slated in the course of the year.

Historically, we've also wanted to smooth the impact over time periods. And when you take the long view on that, I think the treasury team has done a really good job on it.

It's just not possible to know everything and it's not possible to issue enough instructions to all the different markets. The system has to rely on the center focusing on the highest-leverage decisions. That could be moving in innovation around the world or ensuring that an innovation stay in a certain form. But it tends to be directed at a few big decisions and then a focus on talent and culture and a system that can allow an organic amount of self-generation.",0.0437911,0.902
KO-2019-Q1-2019-04-23,130,Answer,2019-04-23,1,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So to take the example we've talked about so far today Coke with coffee. That started out in Asia Pacific. They came up with one variant. The next market then started to move on it before it was really something that the seller was worrying about or looking at. They actually then updated the formula, so it already went from 1.0 to 2.0 by the time it went to the second country based on some of the learnings. And then as it got moved out further, yes, there have been further evolutions of the formula.",0.3891148,0.077
KO-2019-Q1-2019-04-23,131,Answer,2019-04-23,1,2019,James Quincey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Obviously, one of the things we've done from the Corporate Center is try to make sure there's some unity in how the variant is being thought about and how the formulas are being developed. Because ultimately, we have to push against the trend that every market thinks it necessarily has to make the thing better and that we'd end up with 200 versions of everything. It doesn't have to be one version, but 200 is also probably the wrong answer. And so we do apply a process of pressure to get into a corridor that we believe is appropriate to both satisfy local consumer differences, yet drive the growth of a global brand and an efficiency of an overall supply chain.",0.0813262,0.743

Just from my experience over the last couple of years, Brett is that I think we've moved from more of a hub and spoke model to a network model. Our R&D center is now reporting into local operations. We have one in Shanghai, Tokyo, Brussels and Mexico. And they're very much wired together and connected to our business units. So the speed at which stuff is moving around has increased a lot over the last two years, not for what we would ideally want it to be, but it's certainly a key part of the overall profit that James just referenced.",0.8194733,0.861

It's only really just gone - it's only really just been launched. The first sales are only just being made. It seems to have resonated well in the first couple of weeks. And so given how early on it is, it's not - we're not at the stage where we can really make a good call on where are the incremental sales coming from. So they're still small at this stage.

I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S. Your main competitor said that, they are at least not losing share on their cola brand anymore.

Obviously, as other parties large or small invest in the industry, I think it says two things. One it says, the industry is attractive, because it's got growth and profitability. That's why people want to enter. And it says, we need to up our game because the industry is going to become more competitive. And I think that's in the end good news for The Coca-Cola Company and it certainly has been over the last number of years in North America. We've been focused on driving sparkling beverages and that's continuing to do well, particularly our Coke Zero Sugar. BODYARMOR had a good start in the sports drinks category. It's certainly been one of the things that's been driving growth in that category. So we're going to continue to invest. We're going to stick to our overall game plan.

For example, we entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category, capturing over 7 points of value share by the end of the year.

We balance rolling out large-scale brands and keeping an entrepreneurial focus on emerging consumer trend and identifying products that meet those trends. This is about developing brands, channels and points of engagements with our consumers. For example, we adjusted our pack price offering to adapt to the explosion of online ordering in China. And we're leveraging a decade of learnings from North America's Venturing & Emerging Brands model to approach opportunities in international markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a unit in Central and Eastern Europe to test premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate route-to-market. And of course, while it's still early days, the unit has met our expectations, and we are moving quickly to expand coverage to another seven cities in Europe.",,0.718

This can clearly be seen in our EMEA operating segment, where organic revenue growth accelerated from a 3% run rate over the past few years to a strong 5% in 2017. We accomplished this in part due to the revenue growth management initiatives that focuses on small baskets and pack sizes. These initiatives were phased into several EMEA markets over the year, and we will continue to roll them out in additional markets in 2018 and so expect to see continued momentum this year.",,0.963

Over the last few years, as you well know, we have been returning ownership of our company-owned bottling operations to independent companies around the world. In 2017, we accomplished major milestones in three of our most important markets. We sold our bottling businesses in China, creating two strong bottlers with contiguous territories. Our two largest bottlers in Japan merged creating a single bottler, covering roughly 85% of our system in that important profit pool. And most importantly, we completed refranchising of our U.S. bottling operations. At the same time, our North America business continued to deliver top-tier FMCG performance with 3% organic revenue growth.",,0.974

We are assertively shifting our culture, the way we operate, the way we look at growth opportunities and the way we engage with our bottling system. It's been a lot of change, and much of it is only just starting to show tangible results, which is a good thing when you think about future performance.",,0.891

We are well positioned to accelerate our top-line performance based on the actions we've taken, the impact of new U.S. tax legislation on consumer spending and the improvement in the global economy. And while the economic environment in key emerging markets like Brazil and Argentina may not yet have tipped into a tailwind scenario, they are also not causing the same level of headwinds they did last year for our industry.",,0.848
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,25,Remarks,2018-02-16,4,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"With that as a backdrop, we feel confident that the revenue growth initiatives we've launched in multiple markets, coupled with the strong rollout of brands like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, FUZE Tea, AdeS plant-based beverages and smartwater will enable us to deliver 4% organic revenue growth. We will balance productivity with reinvestment to deliver significant underlying operating new (10:48) margin expansion for the year. And our refranchising effort's largely complete and a benign currency environment, we expect to grow comparable EPS 8% to 10%.",,0.95
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,26,Remarks,2018-02-16,4,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, of course, many of you have asked us how U.S. tax reform will impact our business. Overall, we view this as encouraging for the operating environment. Clearly, tax reform will make investing in the U.S. more attractive and should spur economic growth.

In order to have a healthy business, you need to operate in a healthy community. One of today's biggest problems is packaging waste. And over the decades, Coca-Cola has done a lot of work on recycling. We made most of our packaging fully recyclable, and we've invested a lot in R&D around reusing plastic. And now we're doing more. Our system is fundamentally reshaping our approach to packaging, with a goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of all the bottles and cans we sell by 2030.",,0.361

As James said, 2017 was a good year as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during significant change at the company.

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"First, based on our expected earnings split between U.S. and international locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our previously expected 2018 tax rate of 26%. However, we expect increased variability from quarter-to-quarter, as future interpretations of the law and updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax rate estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go through the year, we will update you on any potential changes.",,0.848

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"We currently operate at 3.9 times gross debt leverage and 2.2 times net debt leverage, with a credit rating of AA- from S&P and a Aa3 from Moody's. Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense.",,-0.758

We will continue to reinvest in the business, grow the dividend, fund acquisitions and use any remaining cash for net share repurchases.

This represents over a 20% rebound as we cycle certain cash costs associated with refranchising activities and with the restructuring of the organization in 2017.

But can you just, perhaps, expand a bit further on what makes you confident in the 4% organic growth guide for next year? It's clearly a solid number.

Because I think there's probably a bit of skepticism, maybe some concern out there today that 4% growth may be just be too aspirational, just given what we've heard from others this season. So I guess the question is really why is 4% the right call for Coke when the rest of global CPG seems anchored to more like 2% or 3% growth right now? Thanks so much.",,0.788

I mean, firstly, look back to 2017, clearly, we were making sequential improvement as we went through 2017, as we were finishing the refranchising, as we were building out the greater portfolio plans, we were, as you said, the fourth quarter was good and so was the third quarter in 2017. So I think the first point is, we were seeing some sequential improvement, so we were coming out of 2017 into 2018 with a better run rate.",,0.958

KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,72,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So I think what you're seeing is a good - another good step forward in 2018, of us executing events what we need to execute, particularly the portfolio expansion and some of the RGM work.

However, I don't think the wheels have come off pricing in any shape or form. I think in part it's a question of comparisons. If you look at the two year run rates, you start to see much less noise than you do when you look at just versus prior year, and that includes ourselves where we're lapping a very strong price/mix from the fourth quarter of 2016.

But let me lay it out. I mean, the 4% to 6%, couple of points. Firstly, we always said we were looking for a balance of price and volume.

Although it's worth saying, as a consequence of our focus on smaller packages, transactions are growing a whole point faster than volume. So we see that the strategy is driving us to the right place, but over the long term, we would expect to see some degree of volume growth necessary to be comfortably in our range of 4% to 6%. And no, I don't regret not taking it down to 3% to 5%. And so that's what needs to happen. And it's not something that needs to happen tomorrow morning, but over time, yes, we'll need volume growth to balance out the pricing. And I think that's what we aim to do.",,0.881

Clearly, what needs to happen to get comfortably into the 4% to 6%, and 2018 will be a step on that journey, which is why we're calling out 4%, which is the lower end of the range because we know, kind of, as I was saying on Steve's question, we know we need to do some more things on the portfolio.

We know what macro environments need to improve. We can see a path in the long-term for the 4% to 6%, and we've got back into the range for 2018, and I think it's a solid estimate for 2018. Of course, the world could be volatile, uncertain, but I think it's a good estimate. I reference you back to 2017. We made a realistic assessment of what we thought would happen in 2017.

So if I were to, first of all, disaggregate the gross margin expansion, the majority of that increase is, in 2017, was from the structural change and from pricing. Gross margins are under some pressure from various finished goods businesses, and we also faced a slight headwind from currency and some incremental costs from the hurricanes from last year.",,-0.226

So we delivered very strong comparable margin expansion, and the primary driver of that again being the refranchising. And again offset by some of those costs and a donation that was made by corporate. So the majority of what you're seeing is driven by the refranchising, but at the operating margin level, a significant portion of that is being driven by the productivity initiatives, particularly the lean center initiatives.",,0.542

KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,121,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So our tax rate in 2017 was 24%. And we are estimating, and I underline Kathy's cautionary comments on it's not a fixed rate, so it could vary and particularly vary between quarters going down to 21%. So our year-to-year change in tax rate is 3 points, which, when you take it on the 76% of the cents on the dollar we were keeping, is a 4 percentage point headwind. So if you want to look at it that way, you can take 4 points off the EPS growth due to the tax changes. However, I would also point out that we have called out comparable EPS, so that includes the fact we're selling some of our bottling businesses, which is worth 2 points of growth. So you can net those two together. So actually, I think it's a pretty strong number off a 4% revenue growth in an environment where interest rates are increasing.",,0.959

KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,171,Question,2018-02-16,4,2017,Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch,,"Hi. I guess, question for you, Kathy. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about free cash flow and the effect of the tax code change. We think about two things, gross debt and then, I guess, net interest expense, understand that the free cash flow conversion maybe comes down a bit, but seems like you had more access to cash. So I guess, over time, forgetting about what's going to happen this year, will you have the ability to maybe take gross debt balances down over the next few years is the first question? And then related to that as we think about interest expense, with rates rising and then whatever you may do with gross debt balances, just how we should think about net interest expense, both for 2018 and beyond?",,0.309
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,172,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Hi, Bryan. So gross debt balances will - are initially going to come down about $7 billion, as we said in our remarks. And that will allow us to then kind of balance out our spread.",,-0.645
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,173,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Over the long term, yes, we have - tax reform gives us the ability to have flexibility with our cash. So we will employ the right capital structure for us. We're going to keep a net leverage position of 2 to 2.5 times and as we need to, yes, we could potentially bring down more gross debt. The focus right now is maintaining that net debt leverage position.",,0.039
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,174,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Interest expense is, obviously, we're in a rising interest environment, and our interest expense will be going up, even though we are going to pay down some of our gross debt. And over time, I guess, you asked about specifically the longer-term kind of outlook for interest expense.",,0.718
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,175,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Today, we only have about 20% floating. As we are, I guess, moving over time, more into - we will, I believe move more into a floating rate environment, as we see the benefit, and that will hopefully help us to temper that interest rate expense increase. But for now, interest rates are going up as we have continued to move our debt into longer-term maturities over time. And because of when we bring back the $7 billion, we will take out some of our commercial paper, which has a lower interest rate.",,0.904
KO-2017-Q4-2018-02-16,176,Answer,2018-02-16,4,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So basically, I would say we'll take a look at the capital structure, always manage it over time for now. We believe the right thing is to bring back the $7 billion, pay down gross debt, manage to a 2% to 2.5% net leverage position. And that does impact our interest expense going forward. And over time, we'll continue to manage that as well.",,-0.226

John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I'd like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors.

The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares.

Thankfully, a good starting point matters as a system we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway.

In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant.

At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our Sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke with strong growth in Zero Sugar offerings.

At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single-country brands with little to no scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They're growing slower than the company average but each one still requires resources and investments. So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July the 31st.

We've come a long way in the last couple of years to exit last year to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. And I guess; now we're contemplating trying to get back to that level, but at the same time, with a focus on efficiency.

If we just aim for top line growth, we - I'm sure we'll get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the bottlers or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line and focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or 2, but then the wheels will come off. So we've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation. We were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well and other brands that were struggling.",1.6086957,0.914

When times are going well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times and in these more impaired economic times, for at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to - let's really bring forward the agenda of which every wave of innovation generate, you diverge and then you need to converge on the best - the best product to excel.

And then in an economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored, the price mix performance in Latin America, and I think you highlighted Mexico in particular in the press release, was really notable. So if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a downturn.

Because many of them have well-developed drive-thru and digitally enabled takeaway businesses. So actually, they not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating-away channels.

For example, at-work remains one of the most affected channels, much more so than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants.

Again, as I mentioned here, I think it's important to kind of divide the calendar up. As you know, for the second quarter, we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective. And as we look to the second half of the year, I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and be able to adapt as quickly as possible.

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, turning to our performance in the quarter, as James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% price/mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 points in the quarter. This was due largely to Brazilian bottlers building inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the country around the presidential elections and ahead of changes in local tax regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth quarter, as the elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been phased-in.",,0.852
KO-2018-Q3-2018-10-30,44,Remarks,2018-10-30,3,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So strong organic revenue growth, combined with ongoing productivity measures and the timing of expenses, drove 20% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year, and from cycling bottler refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an approximate 130 basis point impact from new accounting standards and currency.",,0.948

However, we saw a particular benefit in our North America and Corporate segment due to Lean enterprise initiatives.",,0.459
KO-2018-Q3-2018-10-30,46,Remarks,2018-10-30,3,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was roughly in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 400 basis points benefit in its margins, while North America's margin was impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are a lot of moving parts, but if you were to neutralize each of these effects, our underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the quarter and about 200 basis points for the year-to-date period.",,0.34
KO-2018-Q3-2018-10-30,47,Remarks,2018-10-30,3,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all-in, good operational performance, coupled with a timing benefit and a lower effective tax rate, resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 in the quarter, up 14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currency.",,0.902

I am happy to announce that with the sale of our company-owned bottler in Canada at the end of the third quarter, we have now completed our North America bottler refranchising process.

Specifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are two elements within that guidance that are changing and then there's a third element that impacts phasing. While these balance each other for the full year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters.",,0.747
KO-2018-Q3-2018-10-30,52,Remarks,2018-10-30,3,2018,Kathy N.

Second, we now expect to sell CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, in 2019 instead of in 2018. As such, a $0.02 structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction will now shift from the fourth quarter 2018 into our 2019 earnings.",,0.459
KO-2018-Q3-2018-10-30,53,Remarks,2018-10-30,3,2018,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 20.3% for the full year versus our original estimate of 21%. Now while this will be a slight benefit to our fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter earnings. And this was because we needed to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation. So as such, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. Now, taken together, these three changes represent a $0.03 unfavorable impact to fourth quarter earnings, while the full year does not change.",,0.949

So for accounting purposes, we have to look at all of our investments. And we do that at a certain time of year. And based upon the indicators, what happened with the macro environment, and particularly the currency devaluation in South Africa, drove us to have an impairment that we had to write down, basically.

There's obviously been a lot of market concern over the slowing macros in China. There's been the election volatility down in Latin America. You mentioned a number of emerging markets, some of which are looking more positive. Some of which aren't looking as positive. So, I guess, James, can you just give us a bit of an update on your perspective on the macro outlook here in emerging markets as you look around the world; not so much a review of the quarter, but sort of what you saw sequentially as you moved through the quarter in October, and any forward-looking thoughts?

We're growing the soft drink category in revenue and volume. The Coke Trademark's growing. Coke Zero Sugar's growing. We're seeing the sales and volume and transaction uplifts, engagements by the consumers with the brands, so we think we're in a good place in terms of what are marketing is delivering for us.

And then, I know you're not giving 2019 guidance, but as we think about, James, your sort of commitment to continue to grow comparable EPS even with some of the FX headwinds, you've got tax rate benefit going away next year, FX probably another 2 or 3 points headwind.

BODYARMOR is clearly coming from a more premium space with a different consumer proposition in terms of the ingredients and the setup of the drink. So, I think there's space for both. And we expect to be able to go forward, but I think it is worth noting that they are going to be run as two parallel and separate businesses at this stage.

This was driven by North America, Europe, Mexico and China. We also benefited from improvements in certain large emerging markets like India. Our strategic focus on small baskets and packs continued in the quarter, resulting in strong 3% price mix and transactions outpacing volume by two points.

At the same time, the business has made a strategic decision to de-emphasize low-margin water, which follows the strategy we are executing with success elsewhere. Whilst this resulted in a 3-point impact to China's volume growth in the quarter, it did not impact our profitability.",,0.915

Venezuela and Brazil were a 1-point drag on our overall global volume. However, there are some indications of light at the end of the tunnel in Brazil where we've seen the first signs of recovery in GDP for the country.

For example, in the U.S., we acquired the rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water from Mexico that has earned a strong following in Texas and beyond. Our Venturing & Emerging Brands unit will serve as an incubator for Topo Chico and will guide the development of the brand's distribution footprint.

So earlier this year, in Spain, we introduced a line of premium mixers in glass bottles called Royal Bliss for sale only in the on-premise channel. In Great Britain, we just relaunched the stored (09:07) Schweppes brand to offer mixers, designed to pair even better with premium spirits, including a new range of premium mixers called Schweppes 1783. We're also building on a solid foundation in sophisticated flavors through brands like Blue Sky, Barrilitos Aguas Frescas in the U.S. and Appletiser and BOBO (09:27) in Europe. And we plan to leverage these in the appropriate channels where these premium products can excel.",,0.966

That's why we're continuing to invest in our core billion dollar brands to drive relevance.

So for example, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in the United Kingdom last year. And with a combination of a great-tasting reformulated product, better marketing, new packaging and improved execution, this product has been in the market for more than a year, and we continue to see double-digit growth in the UK.",,0.927

We've seen positive results, including a meaningful acceleration in Coke Zero's trends in the U.S. since launch. And year-to-date, global volume and revenue for the brand is growing double-digits.",,0.765
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,28,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"We're applying the same concept to refresh our important Fanta brand. We relaunched Fanta globally this year, reaching most of our major markets by the end of the second quarter. We did this with a four-pillar playbook: that was a new look and a new integrated marketing campaign, a new recipe that tastes great and reduces added sugar, a new spiral bottle that differentiates Fanta on the shelf and improved execution and more media investment. Thanks to this work, we've seen a return to volume growth and an acceleration in revenue growth for Fanta.",,0.953
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,29,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, obviously, not everything is going to work. That is why an agile testing and learning approach is essential. For example, in Costa Rica, we launched Fanta, sweetened only with juice and with no added sugar. And we learned that consumer saw the new formula really as an incremental brand rather than an improvement to the existing brand. So, we had to bring back the original formula and are retooling the market for this new approach.",,0.557

We need to tailor our approach based on consumer mindset and taste in each market. Further, our model needs to be flexible so if a brand introduction isn't successful, we can adapt and change strategies quickly. And we have empowered our local leaders to make these key brand decisions.",,0.691

As we approach the end of 2017, we're nearing the completion of the refranchising process. In the U.S., our refranchising will be complete when the Tri-State Operating Unit and the West Operating Unit transactions close, which we expect to be in the coming weeks. This will lead Canada to be refranchised, and our expectation is to transition to a partner in 2018. Also in early October, we closed on a transaction (12:51), the majority owner of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. As we've previously disclosed, we're in discussions to refranchise this territory and also expect this to happen in 2018.",,0.0

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,35,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations, which resulted in a 15% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for those divestitures, we grew organic revenue 4% in the quarter, with positive performance across all operating segments.",,0.557
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,36,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Comparable gross margin increased over 150 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising our bottling businesses and strong price mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and a slight currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 400 basis points, driven by the divestitures and continued productivity, including the ongoing removal of stranded costs in Coca-Cola Refreshments.",,0.751

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,38,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now turning to outlook, we continue to expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher-margin, capital-light business model. We continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax.",,0.796
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,39,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"We now expect currency to be a 1-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year. The improvement in the currency outlook is offset by an increase in the full year structural outlook. The higher structural headwind is due to the transition of our interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which we will account for as a discontinued operation as we intend to divest the operations in 2018. As such, we will no longer derive equity income from our previous minority stake in CCBA. In addition, the largest driver of the structural impact in Q4 is from the one-time impact from eliminating intercompany profit from our concentrate sale. In addition, because CCBA will be accounted for as a discontinued operation, we will exclude CCBA's net income from our comparable earnings.",,0.875
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,40,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So in summarizing the above, for the full year, we expect a $0.02 lower currency headwind to offset a $0.02 higher structural headwind, so our full-year comparable guidance remains the same. In terms of phasing, the improved currency outlook with a $0.01 benefit to the third quarter, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by roughly a $0.01. However, we expect the $0.02 increase structural headwind to impact the fourth quarter.",,0.848
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,41,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"As you model the fourth quarter, there are few other items to consider. First, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period, which equates to roughly one additional point of topline growth for the quarter. Second, the hurricanes that occurred in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to our supply chain, leading to an estimated $50 million increase in costs, the majority of which will impact the fourth quarter.",,0.66
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,42,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Third, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenue and an 11- to 12-point headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we expect currency to shift to a zero- to 1-point tailwind on net revenue and a 4- to 5-point tailwind on profit before tax as we cycle significant volatility in the U.S. dollar from the fourth quarter of last year.",,0.765
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,43,Remarks,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Now, looking beyond the fourth quarter, we will provide more comprehensive 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter call in February. However, we are reaffirming the outlook on certain items provided at the beginning of this year. We continue to expect structural items to be a 1- to 2-point headwind on profit before tax. Remember, we have a rolling hedging program on hard currencies, so the currency benefit we expect in the fourth quarter should not be taken out of context and extrapolated into a similar benefit for 2018. As such, we still expect currency in 2018 to be a low single-digit headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we continue to expect that our effective tax rate will increase to 26% in 2018.",,0.956

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,49,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,,"My question was really around North American pricing long term. Obviously there's been a lot of concern in general over the pricing environment in the U.S., not just in beverages but across the CPG industry with brick and mortar retailer struggles and theoretically pushback as they look for lower pricing and differentiate themselves or just a margin grab versus CPG suppliers. So, I was hoping in that context, you could give us a review on if Coke's increased focus on pricing in the U.S. over the last few years, is that pressured at all longer term by these retailer dynamics? How do you manage through that? What are you hearing from your customers? And also, just given the new leadership in North America as well as the bottler refranchise, I mean, how does that play into that pricing focus longer term? And how do those changes impact that? Thanks.",,0.873

Firstly, I think the most important thing we focus on as a starting point is making sure we are bringing the innovation, the marketing and the execution to bear for each customer such as the beverage category grows faster than their overall business. And that is the basis on which you get better in-store placements, execution, and the pricing conversation becomes more manageable because in the end, you're creating disproportionate value for the customer. So, that's the first objective.",,0.943

Yes, we have large presence in the grocery channel, but we have multiple other environments where we sell our beverages.

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,52,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"And I would, perhaps, leave a last third thought on the marketplace, which is, yeah, some of the extra pressure from private labels or the stratification of retailers on strategy and pricing is somewhat of an emerging dynamic in U.S., but it has been present in other parts of the world and we have found ways to work with each of our customers to make it work for them and for us. So, we are believers in our ability to create value for ourselves by creating value with the customers even in this ongoing changing environment.",,0.936
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,53,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"And I'll leave you with the last thought, which is, there's no one better positioned to understand this in the context of North America than Jim Dinkins because he's ran the national sales company for the U.S. system for a large number of years.

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,58,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Well, I think, the first and most important green shoot is to look at the performance once you get past the 12-month mark, by which I mean that it's as much like having any new thing, management attention and focus gets heavily directed to new things. And so, of course, you would expect better performance initially on refranchising, and we have got that in the vast majority of territories. But I think the most interesting thing is that after 12 months, when it's cycling and people have got the real hard work of building for the long term, we're still seeing the vast majority of the refranchised territories performing ahead of where they were before.",,0.819
KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,59,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"So they've been able to build on the great re-foundation work that CCR in conjunction with the North American team did. And the sorts of places we're seeing that performance coming from is not just doing better with existing customers which is true, but also in finding new customer outlets expanding the universe of the customer outlets and performing better in the small formats which in a way is partly the theory of the case of why refranchise to local partners.",,-0.093

So first of all, we separate those two programs, Ali, from the $3 billion program, the original program that we announced earlier and then the $800 million program that we added on. On the $3 billion program, I would say we are on target. The productivity is clearly coming from three different places: cost of goods, DME and OpEx.

KO-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,79,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.,,"Sure. I mean, firstly, we over index in terms of share, generally speaking, online. I think, the second thing I would say is e-commerce is not one thing. It's a spectrum. And in part, what I mean by that is there are pure-play e-commerce players. There are bricks-and-mortars who have e-commerce. And you can say that, the omnichannel, there are aggregators. Remember, we're not just grocery. We work with a lot of restaurants, and there are all sorts of restaurant aggregator platforms and restaurants or some QSR chains have their own platforms as well.

Our objective is to work with each customer, helping them drive value for the beverage category with their consumers. And generally speaking, we do better when that happens, and so you can see progress in the traditional grocery idea of e-commerce, whether omnichannel or pure-play. You can see progress on restaurant or quick service platforms. So there's a lot of growth, a lot of activity. But in the simplest sense, it comes back to the central idea. If we can work with them to help the beverage business grow faster than their overall business and be a key participant, it creates a lot of value for them. And therefore, we have a lot of engagements with many of these companies on how can we help create value for them within the context of their strategy.",,0.979

So how was the performance gap of the refranchise territories against BIG in terms of volumes and pricing? And as it relates to better execution at the trade or would you say the flat 50 (42:29) volumes against negative before has been mostly driven by innovation by Coke Zero Sugar, smaller packs?

It's about having the right portfolio for the consumers, the right marketing, the right innovation and the right execution. There's no question that when you bring all those things together, that's when you get the best possible result. In terms of what better execution from the refranchised bottlers, I think that they have been able to build on the foundation that was created by the CCR team. That was we pushed more devolution of accountability, of empowerment, down into the organization of this national bottling company. We were refounded some of the manufacturing supply chain and execution of processes.

Operating results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver against our full-year guidance. As we anticipated, organic revenue was even in the quarter with solid price mix offset by declining concentrate shipments, and it's worth noting the 3% decline in concentrate shipments was primarily driven by a few factors that will self-correct over the balance of the year.",,0.361

So the way I think about it is we delivered even unit case volume growth and 3% price mix, so we're running at around a 3% trajectory, in line with our full-year organic revenue guidance. And while revenue growth is a key objective, we also intend to do this efficiently, and so the underlying operating margin expansion in the quarter underscores our commitment to value creation.",,0.959

We also saw improved performance in China, in part driven by a strong Chinese New Year campaign, and India, while it began the year slowly, performance improved with any remaining impact from the demonetization largely worked through by the end of the quarter.

For example, we've seen the excellent results for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. I told you at CAGNY, we'd be expanding this new and improved formula, supported by a new visual identity, to more markets around the world. In the quarter, we rolled this out to 11 of our top markets, resulting in double-digit volume growth for the brand.

You talked about bolt-ons are always in play, and then I think you didn't rule out if something larger, bigger came along, you would look at it. That's number one. And number two, from our retailers, you're hitting a lot more focus on pricing and maybe more promotion, private label.

I think there should be a reasonable expectation that they will continue at some sort of similar rate.

I think pricing rationalization is certainly our strategy. We're engaged with customers in, you know, how it fits their strategies, each one individually. And largely I would say that you know, we're finding how to create value together.

Probably depends whether we built the business through bolt-on acquisitions or whether we did it from scratch. Either way, the evolution is as you'd expect, as we build a good either leadership position or a close number two, we tend to come into a much more attractive profitability status which is why if we have small positions in categories, we've either got to get up or have a clear path to leadership or a some number two, or not over invest because being sub scale is not a part of profitability.",,0.927

Consistent with what we said on the fourth quarter call, we still expect full year EPS growth to be driven by the second half of the year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Also in the first quarter, concentrate shipment outpace the volume growth, particularly in our EMEA operating segment. This pulls some revenue and profit into the first quarter.",0.6979735,0.889

So actually, the two things are working together. But let me make a couple of points on pricing. Firstly, now that we've refranchised so much about bottling revenue, the revenue of us as a concentrate business or largely a concentrate business is further down the supply chain.

And then when you look at pricing on a global basis, as we talked about, underlying pricing in the marketplace is good. It's very consistent with what we've been doing over the last few years. But there are certain types of timing effects that have reduced how that looks in the P&L. So the marketplace has the pricing.

Similarly, we had a timing effect that brought out more revenue reductions into the first quarter. So again, that will wash itself out in the rest of the year.

But we absolutely believe that once you look past these kind of quarter to quarter effect, you will see good global pricing going forward very consistent with what we have been doing over the last few years. And then specifically, our North America, the minus one is not consistent with where we expect the full year to end up. There are a number of things in North America. One is the timing is much more -- the Easter is much more in the first quarter. The freight that Kathy talked about and then we're giving a kind of an old accounting comparison where is a deduction for revenue, and that will mitigate as we go into the rest of the year.",1.1122928,0.527

All of these things will moderate in North America for the rest of the year. And so we haven't our strategy. You can see in the Nielsen's that we're getting pricing in the marketplace. We fully expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And so low single digit is much more likely for North America, and that's our expectation. So we have an outlook of 4% globally for the full year. We expect that to be balanced between volume and price.

But I was just curious, I guess, how much freight is up kind of year-over-year in North America because I'm just -- I guess I'm surprised by how much it's still impacting you, given refranchising. So maybe, in that context, it'd also be helpful to just articulate what you still distribute yourself because I know there's quite a bit but it's not a 100% refranchising. How freight is actually flowing through the impact of the business as much. Thank you.",0.7640339,0.739

Freight in North America is up like 20% or something. I mean freight is up a lot and that's a consequence of the change in regulation in terms of number of hours that the drivers can drive, et cetera, et cetera, and the way the organization of the freight is put together, and there've been changes to regulations. And that does to some extent reduced the number of drivers or reduced the number of hours. And so freight is up 20%. Why is freight relevant for us?",0.4060056,0.856

In 2018 and going forward, freight is actually in cost of goods and not reducing price/mix. So that is -- if we have taken it out, price/mix would have been better, but just to make it apples-to-apples and make it easier for people to understand, we left it under the old scheme, but it's worth about a point of price/mix, and it's going to start washing out by the time we get into the second half.",0.0875821,0.836

Virtually, every category grew in volume terms. The one - the main one that didn't was juice, but that was actually a conscious decision to change the packaging size, to some extent, to downsize the packaging, given the pressure on juice COGS.

So clearly, market share matters, and the quality of the leadership versus the rest of the competition also matters in terms of scale and margins check. We are managing a broad portfolio. There are -- and clearly, as we are in some of the more challenging and explorer situations by category and by country, yes, it does require more investments to make progress.

The inherent economics of the different categories is possible to achieve attractive margins in each category if you can get to a quality leadership. So give an example, tea, which has done pretty well in a whole number of countries around the world and was getting - it wasn't requiring outsized investment and was trying to look better in terms of margin, we rolled that out across Europe this year.

So it's one, the macro environment is important. Two, we are seeing less inflation. I wouldn't say there's low inflation.
