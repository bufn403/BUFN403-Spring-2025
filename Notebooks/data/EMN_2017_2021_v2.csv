Namely, innovating through our enterprise and allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner.",0.0615322,0.765
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,14,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On slide four, a key driver of success in growing our specialty businesses is our continued upgrade of our product mix. We are driving double-digit growth in our high-margin specialty products through execution of our innovation-driven growth model. Our top innovation programs in AM and AFP are accelerating as more customers validate our innovative, differentiated products, which is driving growth today and into the future, and improving the quality of earnings through the higher percentage coming from our specialty products.",0.796251,0.972

In fact, we saw a 25% increase in the new business close rate during the first half of 2018 and year-over-year, so off to a very strong start. Here too, the many ways we're creating our own growth, improving the quality of earnings and wining the customers.",0.1393643,0.91
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,16,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We have talked in the past about how we leverage our diverse footprint, identify disruptive macro trends that will drive growth of 2 to 3 times the underlying market growth rates. We also talked about how we spend a lot of time to segment the market and carefully select the right partners to drive innovation and change. As a result of that, many of our core and premium products are growing faster than the market. One example that brings this approach to life in a relatively new category is our paint protection film in Advanced Materials.",0.5884271,0.827
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,17,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We combined the technology platform from our Commonwealth acquisition with Eastman's deep capabilities in polyester and coatings, and our in-depth experience in adhesives and functional films to deliver the best product in the market. We launched the next-generation paint protection film that delivers the superior protective surface, which can virtual repair itself when scratched because of its product self-healing properties. Plus, it helps consumers' car stay cleaner longer. The market response has been tremendous. Consumers love the added functionality and channel partners appreciate the opportunity to grow their business.",0.5757946,0.969
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,19,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We also increased our focus on activating a new channel, car dealerships, sell and install paint protection films as part of the car buying process, increasing distribution points by 30% in the U.S. Globally, the overall paint protection film category grew greater than 10% last year. And in 2018, we are on track to grow that business more than three times that underlying market rate.",0.2722086,0.557
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,20,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Another example I would highlight is crop protection as part of the Taminco acquisition. In the crop protection sector, farmers want to maximize yields, which means reducing the number of plants that have fallen over, making crops difficult to harvest and producing lower yields. Eastman has introduced a premium version of the growth regulator product which was pioneered in Europe and has recently been launched in Canada. Our first year sales have exceeded our expectations. We are confident doubling those sales in Canada in 2019.",1.4820701,0.477
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,21,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This innovative specialty product, called Adjust] which will soon be introduced in the U.S., shortens that plant and strengthens the stems, and allows for improved and earlier harvesting that maximizes yield. The product also allows for much broader application window compared to other products in the market today. This allows farmers supply Adjust throughout the year and harvest in a timely way, especially as they focus on dual cropping system such as winter and summer weed.",1.399348,0.84
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,22,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Both of these product launches are great examples of creating revenue synergies from our acquisitions, as we build capability in a market with compelling growth drivers where we are winning with innovation.",0.1593317,0.941
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,25,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I'll start with our second quarter corporate results on slide five. Sales revenue grew across all segments as we did a nice job driving volume growth in our more specialty product lines. This continues to demonstrate the power of our innovation-driven growth model, enabling us to deliver 2 to 3 times underlying growth in the market, and demonstrating we can grow around the globe with our specialties.",0.1402513,0.863
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,26,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,EBIT increased as higher EBIT in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products more than offset a decline in Chemical Intermediates. We are continuing to invest in growth across most of our portfolio and seeing the positive impact of those investments.,0.257803,0.852
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,27,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Solid earnings performance during the quarter was partially offset by $20 million of planned maintenance in our Longview site as well as $25 million impact of industrial gas supplier disruptions at both our Texas City and Longview, Texas sites.",0.4333198,0.077
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,28,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Overall, we remain on track for strong EPS growth in 2018, reflecting the growth in our specialty businesses, stabilization of Fibers and the impact of our compelling free cash flow.",0.2330766,0.914
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,29,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Moving next to the segment results and starting Advanced Materials on slide six, which delivered strong 10% EBIT growth in the first half of the year. For the quarter, sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume across the segment, including premium products such as Tritan copolyester, Saflex heads-up display and performance films, as well as a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix as well as a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased investment in growth in higher raw material energy costs.",0.0822862,0.981
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,30,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E.

EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,31,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"For the back half of the year, we expect underlying business performance to remain strong as Advanced Materials executes its strategy of driving mid single digit volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage.",0.1325497,0.872
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,32,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"With our strong first half results and our expectations for the back half of the year, we continue to expect earnings growth to be approaching the top end of the 7% to 10% range we communicated at our Investor Day, earlier this year.",0.3441427,0.772
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,33,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now, to Additives & Functional Products on slide seven which had a strong second quarter and an outstanding first half of the year. Sales revenue increased, primarily due to higher sales volume across the segment, a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, and higher selling prices more than catching to raws. Volume growth was strong in particular for animal nutrition and coatings and inks, attributed to both improved commercial execution and improving end markets. EBIT increased due to the higher sales volume and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increased investment in growth.",0.124848,0.985
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,34,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Looking at full-year 2018, our expectations remain the same as the guidance on our first quarter call. Strong volume growth across the segment, well above underlying markets, driven by great commercial execution ability, and innovation. However, the second half will not be quite as strong as the first to a few factors.",0.1795703,0.962
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,35,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"In the first half of the year, a tough comp, particularly in the third quarter due to strong solar fills for heat transfer fluids in a year ago period; increased investment and growth, both new assets and growth resources; and lastly, lower industry operating rates for hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins due to a competitor capacity addition. All-in, we expect AFP's EBIT growth to be in the top-end of the 5 to 7% range we communicated at our Innovation Day.",0.3648156,0.915
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,36,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now to Chemical Intermediates on slide eight. Sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices attributed to higher raw material costs and continued improvement in competitive conditions. Sales volume was driven by improvement in asset yields across a range of markets and the means in agriculture and energy were more than offset by lower volume due to both planned and unplanned outages. Regarding the unplanned outages, these were supply disruptions from our industrial gas suppliers at our Texas sites. Unfortunately, the length of time required to return to normal operations was longer than committed to by our suppliers. And therefore, the magnitude of the impact, approximately $25 million, was larger than we expected earlier in the quarter. We are now back at normal operations and happy to see these unfortunate events behind us.",0.0676936,0.848
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,37,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"EBIT decreased in the quarter, primarily due to higher scheduled maintenance shutdown costs and the supplier disruptions, partially offset by higher selling prices and stronger volume in some derivatives.",0.0871504,0.052
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,38,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to address our excess ethylene position. We have taken steps to significantly reduce the amount of excess ethylene we produced for both this year and next. Looking to the back half of the year, we are configuring to run our crackers at reduced rates with purchased propylene only incrementally higher to support downstream derivatives. We are maximizing the propane feed in the crackers to maximize propylene production. I'll remind you that our crackers are unique in their design to make as much propylene as possible. This configuration includes leveraging a higher level of propylene inventory accumulated through the second quarter. We are also leveraging our storage capability for ethylene. As a result, our ethylene spot sales will be limited in the second half of the year.",0.3190109,0.511
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,39,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"In 2019, we are making a modest investment in our cracker flexibility to include refinery grade propylene in our feedstock slate. This enhancement will enable us to ramp up our polymer grade propylene production while dramatically reducing both our ethylene production as well as our propane purchases which minimizes Eastman's exposure to spot ethylene sales. I would also note that this project retains the flexibility to operate under normal operating conditions when market conditions improve. For the remainder of this year and next, spot ethylene price risk is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings.",0.0409404,0.772
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,40,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, now, looking at full-year for the segment. We expect EBIT in the second half to be similar to the first half as the costs from outages do not repeat in the second half, partially offset by normal seasonality, particularly in the fourth quarter and then less ethylene volume being sold.",0.1580867,0.0
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,41,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I'll finish up the segment review of Fibers on slide nine, where results were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue increased due to the sale of nonwoven products, previously reported in other; higher sales volume for acetate tow, primarily attributed to customer buying patterns; and to continued growth in our textiles innovation platform.",0.4896636,0.743
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,42,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"EBIT increased slightly due to higher sales volume and earnings from nonwoven innovation platform products, mostly offset by lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow, and an increased investment in growth including costs previously reported in other.",0.3453587,0.735
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,43,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As was mentioned earlier, we are making excellent progress on our growth initiatives, which is a significant contributor to stabilizing this business.",1.9914876,0.872
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,44,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Looking at the full-year, we expect EBIT to be stable compared to last year. Acetate tow volume is expected to be stable for the year. The impact of our productivity gains will continue to flow through. And the progress of our growth initiatives will contribute to earnings stability. Of course, we had a tough comp in the third quarter due to customer buying patterns last year. But sequentially, we expect third quarter to be about the same as second; and the full-year, we expect EBIT to be about the same as the prior year.",0.3356303,0.866
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,45,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"On slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with first six months operating cash flow of $408 million. Capital expenditures for the first half of 2018 totaled $244 million. We continue to expect our full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million. And we remain confident in our ability to generate $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year.",0.2282124,0.91
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,46,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Looking at the balance sheet. We continue to expect to use $300 million of our free cash flow to reduce debt this year, which we expect will occur in the second half of the year. Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Through the first six months, we returned $410 million through a $160 million in dividends and $250 million in share repurchases.",0.0916092,0.625

As you've seen from the strong volume growth in our specialty segments in the first half of the year, we continue benefit from the high-value innovative products with leading positions in attractive niche markets. We are also delivering revenue synergies of our acquired businesses, through improvements in our commercial execution capabilities and leveraging our combined technical capabilities to accelerate new product introductions.",1.1764466,0.943

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Our continued aggressive productivity is expected to more than offset inflation, and we're investing a portion of that savings in our growth initiatives. Our refinery grade propylene investment to improve our cracker flexibility significantly reduces our exposure to ethylene price risk, while keeping the upside available. And the improvement in our tax rate is also contributing to growth.",1.4669927,0.869

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Putting this all together, our expectations for EPS growth remain the same at 10% to 14% compared with 2017 and will likely be in the middle of this range. Our underlying performance is strong as we focus on the things that we can control. And as Curt noted, third quarter is a tough comp to last year.",0.1903015,0.66
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,54,Remarks,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"One sensitivity is trade and the tariffs that could be implemented by the U.S. and China in the coming months. At this point, we see no exposure to any of the U.S. tariffs that have been implemented or proposed, which highlights another benefit of our vertical integration for most of our raw materials. Regarding the proposed tariffs, we see some modest but manageable exposure with our mitigating actions. When we consider this potential impact, we expect to be safely in the range of our guidance.",0.2408313,0.691

As you think about our portfolio, we continue to march down the path to make two specialties businesses a much bigger percentage of the total with our goal of driving from 70% towards 80%, and are making great progress in stabilizing Fibers and reducing volatility in CI. This all comes together for a terrific bottom-line. We can grow faster than the underlying market.",1.3113284,0.875

We view this through our unique innovation-driven growth model which is at the heart of how we win. We also view this through scale and integration, and investing in the unique capabilities we have in place to drive it; and finally, through our disciplined portfolio management. That leads you to one of the strongest free cash flows in the industry. Our strong return on invested capital is growing, and a compelling compounded EPS growth rates for 2020 and beyond.

EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,61,Question,2018-07-27,2,2018,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you and good morning everyone. So, just curious on the adhesives competitive activity, just if you have any more visibility into that yet. I know, these plant start-ups can move around and what you have. But, is it proceeding as anticipated?",1.3847919,0.826
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,62,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We -- the plant that was completed by our competitor, effectively came on line towards the end of the second half -- first half of the year, so sort of recently. So, we are expecting some impact there as they bring that capacity on line. But, I would remind you that while they added a lot of capacity, demand growth has been incredibly strong in this business, underlying market is 5% to 7%. There is a lot of pent-up demand because the market was -- capacity wasn't available. So, we are seeing sort of leap in demand just because there was a need to use this product. And then, rosin to resin conversion is accelerating as the market is looking for an odor-free water-white kind of adhesive which you can't get with rosins. So, it's important to keep in mind, the rosin market is as big as the resin market. So, all those things combined together to give us confidence that demand will fill this point out relatively quickly.

And then, Curt, if I could just ask you on the free cash flow, just looking at the cash flow statement, I cannot recall this either happened last year or 2016, I can't remember. But your cash flow from operations is actually a bit lower this year versus last year, and it looks like from working capital, receivables, inventories, but what -- sort of one, sort of why is that happening? And then, two, remind us of the mechanism of how you make that up in the second half of the year? Is it just seasonality or what's going on?",0.7954769,0.704
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,64,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Vince. No problem. Yes, it's normal for our seasonal increase in working capital the first half of '18; it's probably little more dramatic this year than last year just because of the rising raw material environment, as well as stronger sales, which is a good problem to have, by the way. So, as you think about those stronger sales and higher input costs flowing to the system, that did have a kind of a net negative impact on free cash flow first half of the year as well as some lingering negative impact from the coal operational incident in the first half of this year.",1.5934333,0.71
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,65,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, if you think about the trend in the second half of the year, cash flows will be expected to improve. One, as you expect, working capital needs will reverse, especially in the fourth quarter. The net proceeds from the insurance, from the operational incident, we do expect some of that more in the second half or as the costs are pretty much now behind us. And also don't forget, we expect a reduction of capital expenditures of a $100 million for the year. You only saw $30 million of that in the first half of the year. So, you will see a $70 million impact of reduced capital expenditures in the second half of the year, on a year-over-year basis.",0.1665991,0.637

So, first of all, I think we're on track for tremendous earnings growth for the year, 10 to 14%, middle of that range is great results, improvement in tax to help a bit as well in the back half. So, we feel great about what we're doing on earnings growth. And the second half is a bit different than the first half. As you noted, with ethylene, the prices of ethylene are quite low right now. And we've made all these investments and changes to avoid basically participating on spot market and not incur those negative margins. So that's actually quite helpful, but of course you have less volume we're selling relative to last year. So, that's a change from where we were in April.",0.1943765,0.924

Some of that's tamped down a bit by the growth investments we're making, and that are accelerating as we go through the year.

EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,76,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, as you look at the margins in AM, you have margins actually improving as that mix upgrade delivers value year-over-year and sequentially. That's then been offset by the increased gross spend. And just to step back to corporate level for a second, we've told you that we are increasing our growth spend between the new operating assets we're bringing on line like Tritan and PVB assets in AM as well as Crystex plant and ketones expansion in AFP.

So, that sort of nets each other out. And the great thing about that is the trends in the fixed cost leverage as we forward. So, we don't expect the same step up in investment -- growth investments next year across the Company that you are seeing this year.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The place where we offset that is as we discussed at Innovation Day, we intentionally had some price concessions in the interlayer business in the annual contract negotiations last fall to achieve significantly improved mix on our heads-up display and acoustic sales that are much higher margins than our standard. So, while we gave up some price, we gained significantly on the mix and earnings as a result of that, which is consistent with our strategy. So, everything in AM is playing out exactly as we intended, driving a lot of earnings growth.

So, to answer your question, if we take second quarter by itself that the supplier disruption was -- cost us about $25 million and the maintenance spend would have been -- was 20. So, if you didn't have both of those events, yes. Our earnings would have been up 45. But normally, if you look at total maintenance for the year, for this year compared to last year, it's about the same. So, this is more about timing within a year. And so, that's why it was more $20 million in the second quarter. Greg, do you want to add something?",0.2648737,0.422

And certainly, if you exclude the operational outages, we are -- I am just going to make this on a full year basis, Jeff. When you exclude the operational outages that we've incurred and think about that $50 million of gross spend that we are investing for future growth this year, the gross margins this year are quite better. And so, as you move into next year, you are going to see that happen because obviously we don't intend to have the same operational problems as well as the fixed costs are going step up again next year. So, the variable margin grows, creates leverage, fixed gross margins will improve. So, there is every intention that those gross margins are getting better as we move forward.",0.3064451,-0.569

Yes, we do expect that volume better than market because of innovation program. I would also remind you, because it works the opposite way as input costs came down, so did revenue. In the future, revenue is going to up and thus by nature even as we grow gross margin dollars, the fixed percentage could move around a little bit on it just because of that inflationary pressure. We really look at it as a gross margin as a per unit basis, and we are seeing good growth in that per unit basis.",0.4588427,0.649

So, we are modifying the front end of our cracker and refining capability on the front end to be able to add RGP to the mix instead of just using ethane and propane. And the great thing about this story is we had to make some large capital investments as all of you know in our two smaller crackers for safety reasons. And this was the second cracker that we just finished modifying. It made available equipment that was being used historically, now not needed. And we can modify that equipment to now be the refining capability for RGP to include in the mix. So, it's a modest capital investment that normally would have cost significantly more amount of capital, taking a lot longer time to do.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, now, we can move some of our exposure to an RGP, PGP spread, which is much more stable than where olefin prices and propane have been, reduce the ethylene dramatically that we produce which we've never wanted to make. You have to remember, our entire strategy is based on making propylene and specialty propylene derivates. So, it sort of gives us the flexibility to be out of that market. But, it's very flexible to switch back. So, we can move back towards ethylene, if the prices get attractive. And as you look at it, when the ethylene export capacity comes on line in 2020, it probably will be attractive again.",0.3166259,0.898

Just a reminder, again, I want to reemphasize what Mark's already said. Our crackers are still good, reliable assets that have created that competitive advantage for our high-value propylene derivates by leveraging shale gas. And so, the primary objective of our recent efforts was to monetize our excess ethylene position and then potentially certain ethylene derivates to eliminate their earnings volatility that came from those products. Over the past few years, we've engaged with multiple parties on a variety of options to sell or otherwise monetize this excess ethylene. However, current marketing conditions, combined with the current geopolitical environment on trade have made it very difficult to move forward at this time. Until conditions improve, we have taken these steps then to such that spot ethylene prices will not have a material impact on the earnings the remainder of this year and going into 2019.",0.3879206,0.935

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then, for your question on the crackers, we are shifting the mix hard, we are going to reduce rates on the crackers. And until this investment is in place for next year, because we accumulated so much propylene inventory and have some storage available for ethylene, we're able to mitigate the need to buy much additional propylene than normal, which is great, even though we're reducing the cracker run rates and avoid selling ethylene in the market at these prices.",0.50978,0.361

So, mix improved dramatically, as it has for years now, improving margins in that segment. We have offset that with about 100 basis points increase in growth investments. So, those sort of net out and prices didn't increase. What I said is, they increased across the polyester spectrum. So, we are increasing prices there and keeping up with raws, no issue there, doing a great job by the commercial teams there. But, we did intentionally reduce prices on the interlayer products.

EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,104,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, from a second half, your point of view, first of all, it starts with the tough comp. So, last year, we had incredibly strong volume in some areas of the Company. So, the solar fills that we mentioned to you in the higher -- the share gain we got in the last, the second half of last year due to environmental enforcement in AFP. As well as we noted, the customer buying patterns being a bit high in the third quarter last year in tow, which won't repeat this year. And then, of course, we're not selling ethylene. We sold a bunch of ethylene last year at some margin and this year we're not selling it. So, those all create a tough comp relative to last year.

And then, you have some margin coming off in adhesives, as we've discussed a few moments ago. So, those all sort of play into why the second half doesn't grow as fast as the first half. And as Curt noted, currency isn't the tailwind. So, they're all dynamics, they don't give us any concerns. We still feel we are on track to deliver very strong growth this year and well-positioned to grow into next year.

I am curious about the Eastman philosophy. And the question or the comment was basically, there are some specialty markets where if you react too aggressively to raw material inflation, it sort of comprises or could compromise the value-add approach to a product line. And therefore, when the raws go the other way, you start get back some relief. Just curious when you think about your portfolio, how do you differentiate across that portfolio and the ability to get price to recover some of these raw materials?",0.4001155,0.845
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,114,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Bob, it's a great question and a really important one when we really get into the nuances of running a great specialty business which I think we've built. You have to be very thoughtful about how you manage prices with your customers because you want to capture the value for the products that you have, you want to treat your customers with respect because they are aware of how raw materials change both up and down. But most importantly, you want to keep them highly engaged to continue to working with you on innovation, right? The vast majority of innovation isn't with new customers, it's with existing customers helping bring them additional new products. So, you have to -- in the tires business, the coatings business, the glass business, you got the same set of customers of a very long time. So, that has to be a very collaborative relationship that includes working on innovation.",0.1903015,0.989
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,115,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, yes, you are careful about how you manage price, and you want to provide price stability to them. So, when raws go up, you increase prices but you do it carefully and you don't be abusive about it. And when raws go down, you hold on to some of the value but ultimately you have to share some of it. And if you go back to our transcripts over the last three years, I think I've been pretty consistent in talking about that and how we've managed it, both in '15 and '16 and how we've managed it over the last couple of years. But, what I would highlight is we have done a great job in managing price relative to raws. Especially in CI and AFP right now, we've done a -- we've been able to keep pace with raws and distribution costs. And I think, I fairly covered the AM discussion on that topic where we are doing great in polyesters and made some intentional choices to improve mix with our customers. So, yes, you got to think about that and be very careful in what you do.",0.4380603,0.987
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,116,Question,2018-07-27,2,2018,Robert Koort,Goldman Sachs,"And then, you acknowledged that there has been some price down on your auto interlayer business. Is that a one-time event, is that something that we should expect to continue and then you offset it as you are saying by seeking out mix benefit? Is this one-time correction, because they're under a little bit of pressure? Can you give us some help there?",0.1864896,0.501
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,117,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So, the nature of that business is, as we shared with you at Innovation Day, the price difference between our premium products and our sort of standard products in that segment are quite different. So, as you gain scale and efficiency in making these premium products, you tend to give back a little bit of price on those premium products as they are buying significantly more volume, and your cost efficiency is also higher from a fixed cost leverage point of view as they grow. So, from a margin point of view, you are not taking much of a hit, but you do have to share some of that -- sort of value created by them, buying a lot more with some price reduction. So, there is always a natural amount of that that occurs, happened last year, happened this year. There will be a little bit of it next year. The tricky part is, if you put these annual contracts in place and if you go back to what we were negotiating in the fall, raws of our -- come in a bit higher than we expected this year. The key drivers of raw material prices for interlayers is international ethylene prices, not local, and acetic acid prices, because we're buying them and PVOH. So, you can imagine that's created some pressure relative to where we thought we were last year. That part of the story that it's -- the key thing is focus on the 9% volume and mix that is a significant upgrade in margins. And when you back out the gross investments, the margins are great.",0.2856561,0.952
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,120,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, first, acetic acid is not a priority business for us. We have a huge acetyl stream that is focused on producing acid anhydride. Acetic acid is a co-product of our downstream derivative operations that we have to sell to sort of clear the system. So, we're not in the global acetyl business like some other people are. We're really in a sort of North American centric acetic acid business where we're clearing up the co-product in our operations. So, just entirely different business model relative to what Celanese referred to. The reality is just prices are higher in acetic acid right now due to decent demand growth in that business as well as a number of supplier outages, both here including us for a while and BP and people in China. So, that's really driven the improvement in acetyl pricing for us versus the very different business model that Celanese has here, because our acidic anhydride isn't about selling it, right, it's about converting it, all the specialties downstream and we sell what's left over. So, it's just entirely different business model.",0.2489813,0.938

So, we've been able to add a lot or organic capability and commercially taking it from a European to more of a global business and accelerating product development by combining our technology people with theirs. So, we feel good about what we're getting done in organic. You're right. We're not a big player in that space. This is an area where we'd be open to sort of bolt-on M&A. But we're very-disciplined. So, we'll have to see if there is M&A out there in the marketplace here and other places that we're looking that meet our financial criteria, not just our strategic one.

So, demand -- primary demand is -- in the marketplace continues to be solid around the world. Obviously, things like tax reform and less regulation here, recovering Europe helps. Tax -- concerns around trade are creating some caution, but overall that's good. Most importantly, we're focused on creating our own growth and have demonstrated our ability to grow sort of two to three times the underlying industrial production rates.

So, it just made sense.",0.500815,0.475
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,130,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'll answer your second question first and then ask for clarification on the first. So, on your second question, Lawrence, we don't see any inventory overhang in the marketplace that we are aware of. I am not sure I understood your first question. Could you repeat it?",0.1874491,-0.241
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,132,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"No, we don't provide that kind of detail. What I can tell you is AFP and CI they've done a great job of managing price relative to raws and distribution costs. In fact, their margins per KG are up a little bit. To remind you, as Curt noted, when raw materials go up and you hold your spreads constant, your margin percentage goes down because just of the math. But, we're doing a great job in those two areas. And as -- and I think we have fairly discussed the AM topic and how we're managing the total margin there.",0.6548492,0.791
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,133,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, overall, I feel like we're in better shape than we ever have been on how we're managing price relative to raws.",1.4726976,0.687
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,135,Question,2018-07-27,2,2018,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"Yes. Good morning. So, Mark, you've got a lot going on at Longview. You mentioned throttling back on the cracker, operating rates changing the feedstock mix to be increasingly geared to propane feed, and then the RGP investment. If we were to boil all that down, what is the net impact on your net short position in propylene going forward?",0.3060818,0.681
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,136,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, for this year, it has no impact. We have to incrementally increase our propylene purchases relative to last year with all the actions that we are taking. So, even though we're obviously reducing our cracker run rate to some degree and not selling ethylene through the combination actions we've taken, we're not incurring a material increase in purchase propylene costs, which is great.",0.2775061,0.758
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,137,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And second, with the RGP investment next year, we would buy less propylene than this year because of leveraging the RGP to make propylene. So, it mitigates some of that exposure for us, improves our spread exposure by getting into the RGP, PGP game versus propane to propylene and reduces ethylene production. So, it's a win on all fronts.",0.3520782,0.783
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,138,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And Kevin, if I could add, just, as you think about that change of mix, most of the benefit of that change is going to felt in Chemical Intermediates. There will be a little hurt moving to AFP as we see some of the additional costs from the crackers running at reduced rates. But generally good, positive, mostly in CI, a little hurt in AFP going forward.",0.3923794,0.55
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,139,Question,2018-07-27,2,2018,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up, I think, you mentioned that you anticipate operating earnings in CI in the second half to be roughly equal to the first half. Can you help us out a little bit with the expected quarterly cadence? For example, was there any spillover in July from the various supplier disruptions that you indicated and the actions you are taking in Longview? How should we think about kind of 3Q versus 4Q there?",0.5839149,-0.506
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,140,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes.

And you will see most of that seasonal impact in the fourth quarter.",0.8545232,0.402

EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,144,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, Matt. So, first of all, it starts with $1.1 billion of free cash flow. But, what Mark was talking about acceleration was we're doing more share repurchases in 2018 than we did in 2017. Part of that is less de-leveraging. So, we are targeting $300 million this year versus we did $350 million last year. So, you've got the combination of growth in free cash flow, little less de-leveraging, and attractive dividends, that leaves a lot of free cash flow available to do share repurchases in absence of a bolt-on acquisition.",0.3384678,0.968
EMN-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,145,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would just emphasize the $1.1 billion of free cash flow, as we wrap things up. But, no, we feel great about strategy, we feel great about the progress we're making on the volume and mix improvement driving earnings growth this year and positioning us really well for growth next year, and obviously cash has been great and we will continue on the track that we committed to at the beginning of the year.",0.8846781,0.982

We said volumes are going to approach you know, '19 levels not get all the way back there. So we're seeing great recovery in the auto markets and BMC et cetera.

So does that mean better than typical from a seasonality standpoint, when I would presume November, December are usually weaker months or does it just mean typical seasonality from that October level? Trying to sort of gauge what you've baked in, in terms of what may or may not be a typical this fourth quarter?",0.1177829,0.433
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,41,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, this is in the a-typical category, Bob. So normally we have a really strong third quarter and second quarter, and then things, you know, trail off into the fourth quarter as people - you know, we as well as our customers sort of destock, you know, for cash reasons. And the primary demand in some markets like BMC and other things, you know, slow down, that's normal.",0.1515892,0.836
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,42,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On a primary demand basis, some things will still slow down, like building construction, to some degree, but even that is showing some more strength than normal because of all the delays that occurred in the summer. So, primary demand seems a little bit stronger, but the more significant driver of why we're going to have much better performance than a normal seasonal pattern is a number of our customers we're like us, aggressively destocked inventory through the summer, I think we can all acknowledge and see the demand came back in the third quarter better than we expected.",1.0118174,0.957
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,43,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So people are really tight on inventory, the automotive companies are really tight. BMC is obviously very tight, relative to the way demands come back. And that's true in consumer durables, and a bunch of other markets. And so what you see is people trying to build back to normal inventory levels, I don't think they're trying to build to something excessive, they're just trying to get back to stable, you know, natural inventory levels to support the now - the better demand, and then we probably expected in the second quarter.",0.1629992,0.891
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,44,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that's all sort of good news. But normally, you've got this destocking going on, instead, you've got this sort of restocking back to normal levels that we can see. So that's going to give us a lot more stability, especially true in a - we're seeing this both in the auto side, as well as some of the durables, but also true everywhere else. I mean, we're running utilization flat out in CI, a number product were running flat out to support this demand and building action in the quarter. Did that answer your question Bob?",0.5566422,0.903
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,45,Question,2020-10-30,3,2020,Robert Koort,Goldman Sachs,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, obviously typically the fourth quarter destock ramifications can be pretty negative. But it sounds like just the reverse this year. If you look to next year, your cash flow has been very impressive. As you contemplate having to rebuild that working capital in your own franchise for next year. Have you sort of reconciled with that might be kind of drag on cash flow that could be for next year?",0.3862587,0.681
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,48,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Some of it is a natural [indiscernible] where you've got earnings improving and inventory, you know, to some degree will come up and lesser than the past because investments really maybe those sort of naturally hedge each other, right. So the EBITDA grows, you know, the inventory comes, the value of EBITDA is greater than the cost of the inventory. And that sort of balances each other out.",0.1780766,0.848
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,49,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"CapEx will be a little bit higher, too. As we start ramping up some of our circular investments, but we've modeled this a lot and netted it out. We think it's going to be roughly in a sort of similar to this year.",1.2726161,0.0
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,53,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, well, let's start with - Performance Films had a blowout a couple of years and a blowout first nine months of the year. So you know, they're - on the first nine months their volume mix is only down 5%, in a market that's down 20%. And they're up year-over-year in the third quarter. So they're having a great year.",0.291361,0.826
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,54,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And it's a combination of things. One, the Window Film business is very solid and always growing. Two, our Paint Protection Films are growing tremendously fast at very high values. As that marketplace, you know, has just taken off and we've talked to you about that over the years and now we're even expanding from just clear into black or opaque products as we go into next year, which is going to give us a whole - a new addressable market. So a lot of growth potential there.",1.3643032,0.894
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,55,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But it's not just that, the bigger part, frankly, is an excellent channel strategy and a service model. We have an incredible team out there, especially in the key markets, we serve like North America, China, and the rest of Asia, that has instituted a far superior model and how we support both the aftermarket dealers, but also building these auto dealership programs where they can now sell these products as a value up with the car, which they're always looking for, in where sort of train, develop, support them in doing that, you know, at the auto dealerships. And we have huge relationships with the top two auto chains here in the US, as well as the big auto chains in China.",0.6153219,0.962
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,56,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it's a combination of multiple things that's getting as to win great products, great new markets growing, but an excellent service model that gives us durability. And now we're going to add on also a whole new digital tool that dramatically improves the install ability of the product with the installers. And that's very attractive and launching as we speak.",0.1682967,0.975
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,58,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So if you go back, you know, 5, 10 years ago and say what was the businesses, primarily heat transfer fluids for chemical plants like polyester plants, et cetera. That was really the predominant source, very attractive business, lots of growth and China consuming it. But the market, end markets has dramatically diversified.",0.0313773,0.862
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,59,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The first big new market was solar. So you have to use - when you heat up these panels, these reflective panels out in the desert, you got to get the heat transferred to the turbine engine, and our fluid does that. So solar has been a huge driver of growth for us over the few - last few years. And a new market, it's really taken off for us as LNG. So they also consume and use these products in those facilities.

It was a while ago when we had our significant portfolio transformation, but we've sold off a lot of underperforming businesses in our history, and we've had very successful acquisitions of great specialty businesses to give the portfolio the strength, not just in the stability of revenue that you're seeing this year, you know, and let's not forget, we started with the trade war and COVID.

And as we said, we saw two businesses, you know, tires, adhesives, that were developing instability, that was inconsistent with our strategy, especially as part of AFP, and needed to address that. I think we've made great progress on managing the cost structures, especially in tires, where we're going to take out a couple plants and improve its cost structure in a meaningful way.

But you know, the reality is, the tires business is really challenged, and the competitive dynamics. The ADT tariffs that got put in place shoving China tires back into China, then the broader trade war with China kicked off by Trump just created, you know, huge drop in demand, while competitive capacity is coming online.

You know, in the prepared remarks, you talked about benefiting from the DIY market. So, you know, how big is that for you versus sort of, you know, regular construction.

But overall, I'd say the portfolio is doing great. I mean, it's got innovation, driving growth across all three main elements of it, especially plastics has been incredibly steady through this year where things like some durables we're off in the in the second quarter, but we had tremendous sort of COVID-driven strength and, you know, shrink for packaging that goes into grocery stores.",0.2351263,0.888

And we had a target of you know, this year getting to $500 million. We were well on track at $40 million last year, even in the trade war.",0.0228199,0.898
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,140,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we continue to have great engagement, even virtually, with customers. We've told you about all kinds of wins we're having in this year, across our product portfolio. And so we feel good about it, but it's not going to be at the level that we aim for.",0.4111654,0.79
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,141,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we'll always give that to you. And we know that new business innovation, you know, will build and I think we can get back to that level, you know, that target next year in 2021. So I feel good about the growth that we can sort of put together there.",0.7273839,0.812
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,142,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And it really fits with where we're I think we're headed for delivering a very attractive 2021. So, you know, Willie told you, we've got fixed costs basically flat, we've told you that we have $100 million tailwind in asset utilization next year, relative to this year, volumes were just flat in '21 versus '20, right, because we took all these aggressive inventory management actions this year to go beyond demand to, you know, generate cash, and we're quite happy we did that. And that inverts, you know, becomes $100 million tailwind of flat volumes.",0.4523227,0.822
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,143,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then it's innovation from new business that we're just talking about here. The market recovery, that you might, you know, have at some level, depending on how COVID everything plays out, all create incremental growth above that. And because of the inventory actions we've taken this year, the innovations and, you know, the growth that we're getting there as above average margins for the company, because the inventory management we've done, you know, we don't have any fixed costs headwinds. And the incremental margins for growth next year are probably going to be 60%, 50 to 60%.",0.2106764,0.91
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,144,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So very attractive margins, so that growth you know, flows the bottom line and we put up out together $0.60 just for flat volume on utilization, and flat cost and then growth - and that goes back to '19 levels.",0.1491443,0.849
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,145,Question,2020-10-30,3,2020,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"Okay, that's helpful. And secondly, Mark, I want to ask about interlayer films, you talked about the acoustic films and heads-up displays. Do you feel as though you're gaining market share in that business? Or is it more a situation where you know, volumes could be exceeding auto sales as a function of restocking? Or perhaps both of those things? How would you characterize the market dynamics in any interlayer films?",0.3984713,0.901
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,146,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Interlayer is a great business. It's more directly tied to OEM production obviously, so that production goes up and down, so our volume. We still benefited and did better than in early market this year Kevin with acoustic and heads-up display, but not to the same extent as performance films, because performance films is expanding, its overall market that it serves.",0.1707416,0.542
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,147,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so it's doing well, the HUD and acoustic doing well, this next gen set of products I just mentioned are going to give us additional tailwind as we go into next year. So we feel that it will continue on a volume mix basis, it will do. The mix is incredibly important to keep in mind about this, the entire company, especially in AM, so when you're selling a-protection films or window films or acoustic, heads-up display, that's way above segment average margins and AM, including Tritan in the circular economy parts we're selling same thing. So all those growing, isn't just volume, it's a mix upgrade.",0.0794621,0.777

EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,153,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There's always some normal. I mean, while we don't have normal seasonality of the drop space or things I said earlier, we still demand to be a little bit less, you know, in products with some seasonality. So tremendous strength to get back to last year's levels and earnings. So I think that's a great accomplishment, as we look at it, but a little bit less than third quarter.",0.1128769,0.48
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,162,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So obviously, we've considered carving Tow out of the portfolio a number of times, especially back in 2015. Unfortunately can't be carved out John, it's so integrated into the Kingsport site. And so interdependent with all the cellulosic growth we have in AFP, and AM and shared assets and recycle use can't separate it, it would be a disaster. So you have to grow out of it. And that's what we're doing, right.",0.0977995,-0.128
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,163,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So our strategy is, you know, through, you know, ultimately, if you go long term enough, replace all the Tow with textiles and other applications with that growth and obviously, that's going to take some time. But our strategy and the answer to that question, when it comes up is, we have to maintain the economic integrity of the company to invest in growth and support our success. So, Tow is part of that, but we're going to work as hard as we possibly can to grow in textiles was also as attractive margins, and grow that business as the Tow business declines over time.",0.1246944,0.871
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,164,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J.

EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,166,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So john, I don't have a quick easy answer to that question. What I can't tell you that, sort of refine a little bit about what the paint protection film is. So paint protection film comes in two versions. One is the full wrap of the car, but a lot of people just wrapped the vulnerable - put the film on just the vulnerable parts of the car, the front, the side, the door handles, et cetera. So it comes in two different versions on how much you sell per car when you do PPF.",0.4079055,-0.285
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,167,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And it is certainly additive. When you think about our presence on a car, because the interlayers is doing one thing and acoustics and HUD, the films on the windows are, as you've noted, so it's not just tinting, it's actually solar rejection is the big value proposition. So we sell a lot more in hot locations than cool locations, because the films are much more advanced today than they were 20 years ago. And the big value proposition isn't just the tinting, it actually rejects a tremendous amount of solar heat that actually gives you better fuel efficiency since you use less air conditioning. And so that's, you know, additive.",0.0264874,0.817
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,168,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then you've got the PPF. But we don't break it down on a sort of ratio basis like that. It's something we probably should do, and we'll take a look at that. But what we do know is we're getting a lot of more presence on each car sold. And the dealers, as you mentioned, are really getting interested in it, right. It used to be very much an aftermarket business NPF. And a lot of our growth is now in collaboration with these programs we're doing with the auto dealers, where they sell it as a upsell in the car, sometimes it's pre-installed on luxury cars, so you don't have a choice about it, when you're buying it. A lot of it is after - sort of an upsell at the point of sale. So a lot of different ways to grow.",0.0370823,0.795
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,172,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,We've seen the same rapid recovering demand in tires and the third quarter has been quite good and consistent with what you're talking about.,0.5211899,0.401

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then on the infrastructure question, it will benefit us, we're not really focused on in a large infrastructure projects and the kind of materials we make, we tend to go more into consumer durables, cars, building construction, but more commercial than bridges. And, and so it depends on the nature of what the infrastructure is.",0.1976365,0.077
EMN-2020-Q3-2020-10-30,182,Answer,2020-10-30,3,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"What's great about that is it just creates broader economic growth, which were highly leveraged. So, while it may not be participating directly in some of the infrastructure projects, we are having - you know, certainly tied to macroeconomic demand and people have more pickup trucks going to work in construction, which is good for us, et cetera. So, we'll certainly benefit like everyone does from the improving economy, driven by it.",0.4718826,0.97

We shifted our financial forecast for prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion. While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio, over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities.

Significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war, as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of earnings growth.

Mark, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the molecular recycling plant. I can't pronounce, methyl, whatever it is. Just help us understand, it's sounds like you're saying this is going to be the world's largest. But, what is the scalability of these in terms of how much larger could it be? Where are you in terms of customer demand in terms of filling it out? And in the script you talked a little bit about there being clear evidence of willingness to pay price premiums for renewable products? How are you going to be pricing this product? Maybe we could just start there.",2.0281174,0.967
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,26,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Vincent. And it's a methanolysis. So, it's a technology that's been around for a long time, Kodak developed it decades ago, to recycle actually polyester X-ray material. And then, they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010. We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming an incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID it's just become stronger, not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here.",0.8345558,0.891
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,27,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range, specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmic et cetera. So, a wide range of markets, a lot of customers are very interested in this as they're making aggressive commitments to improve their recycled content. And so, there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications.",0.9515077,0.984
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,28,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene where they put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So, the demand is there. From a value point of view as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe, as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And, I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kinds of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so, we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but, sufficient to give us an attractive return. But, our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business. And, we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side, because, we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of the capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand, and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So, the economics here are quite attractive.",0.0725346,0.935
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,29,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications, through premiums and accelerate growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive is some key examples. And, our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks.",0.4832926,0.44
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,30,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks. And just as a follow-up, $600 million of revenue, is that just sort of assuming from this plant, or is that assuming additional capacity down the road?",0.6405868,0.843
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,31,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Right. You asked about the scalability of this and additional plant. Sorry Vincent. So, to be clear, the $600 million in new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis, we look at it as a standalone opportunity, both the polyester revenue, the polyester renewal technology and the carbon-neutral technology combined, we think is between a $500 million and a $1 billion revenue platform for the Company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in one year. It takes years to build that out. But, a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after -- with Tritan before this and this would be the two biggest platforms that we have.",0.494295,0.877
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,32,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, that doesn't include scalability. So, that's building plans to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world, who are very interested in recycled content for their needs, and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world, focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there is an advantage to having them in different regions. So, we think there's a whole another vector of growth on top of this. But, it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that.",0.5203749,0.796
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,37,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. And in your methanolysis facility, why don't you just buy methanol? Why do you have to make methanol?",0.9278729,0.173
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,38,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Jeff, it's not -- we're not making methanol. So, I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But, what you basically do is, you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates as DMT, and EG and other monomers and purify. So, it's actually an input, not an output to the process to depolymerize, the molecule. So, that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy efficient than the fossil fuel process.",0.3614507,0.771
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,39,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, while it takes a bit of energy and methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So, we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology. And I think, that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are two fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis, we need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But, at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So, every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also, 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock.",0.905868,-0.202

You talked about a 5% revenue headwind in chemical intermediates in 2021 from the changes that you made at the Singapore oxos facility. That seems really big.

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,46,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Thanks, John. To your point, as we've made the decisions to, I'll call it, cease the operations at our Singapore site, fundamentally, it was based on the raw material positions that we have at that facility in Singapore. And roughly, it is a world-scale equivalent of an oxo facility. It's about a fifth the size of what we have in Longview, but still significant from a volume output. The key factor, as we think about 2021 and going forward is, overall, that will give us an opportunity to, I'll call it, continue to debottleneck our facilities in Texas where we have a much better cost position.

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,50,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. It's a great question. It's one of the strangest questions. When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed, and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question. So, we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site. We can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these two assets. So, it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets we used here.",0.1638142,0.816

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets, are very interested in a take back program, right? So, they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products. So, it's a true absolute closed loop. And so, it will take a while for that to obviously develop. But, I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. [Indiscernible] is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop.

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,54,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"No, no, we're commercial in both now. So, we're doing both now. We've just talked a lot about the CRT, which we call the carbon renewal technology. Basically, we're changing our technology, if you will, from gasification to reforming when you go from sort of coal to waste plastic and replacing that coal with the waste plastic with a carbon footprint that's sort of 20% to 50% lower. So, it's a very compelling technology. That goes into our textiles, our Naia fabrics that we're growing quite strongly as well as into some thermoplastics in the specialty plastics business and a new growth opportunity we see in AFP around fumed insulation that would be cellulosic-based and very sustainable offering versus EPA. So, a lot of different applications in CRT going on at the same level, that's part of that $500 million to $1 billion platform combined with the PRT. So, a lot going on.",0.2656887,0.318

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,57,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. And so, I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So, we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So, that -- those costs are obviously coming back. But, there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So, cost relatively flat on the fixed basis.",0.6874491,0.151

I mean, that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth. And then, we've got volume growth in three categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so, that is we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year as the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact.",0.4889976,0.997

So, a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth. We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so, that's a great example of innovation creating growth, great success in acoustics and heads-up display, creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019.

There is a lot of uncertainty. So, while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue, we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet, this year. We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So, that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range.

You talked about market recovery and innovation, and it sounds like mix is going to be important as well. But, is there a way you can help us better understand the level of volume growth that's embedded in your EPS guidance, looks like in the pandemic year, went down 5%? How should we think about the high end and the low end, whether it's an absolute level or relative to GDP or another macro metric? How would you have us process that?",0.4873676,0.99

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Kevin, from a KG point of view, I think you would think about our volume recoveries being similar to GDP and then you get some leverage from mix. So, as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way, like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation, even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So, you've got markets like that that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so, those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins. And then, you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals.

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,69,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But, what's nice is the stability you get from this, right? So, these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now, this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So, it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it that's driving the earnings is mix versus KGs.

My understanding is that you can use different sorts of waste streams such as old PET bottle resin and maybe polyester from carpet and so on. And so, my question is what testing have you done already regarding the issue of variability of waste streams? And does it matter? In other words, if I'm unzipping it, as you say, into ethylene glycol and DMT, is it the case that the output is entirely fungible and the variability is a nonissue, or do you have to go through customer approval processes, et cetera, as you implement the new process?",0.4185004,0.235
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,71,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So, let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So, the technology methanolysis is a pretty robust technology. And methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But, when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester X-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day, based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.",0.1581092,0.067
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,72,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So, mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time.

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,73,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, molecular cycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material to plastic that they cannot use. It ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So, the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.",0.3573757,0.893
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,74,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But, once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop.

So, Tritan Renew is actually the formal brand name, Mike. There will be Naia Renew in textiles and a series of other products. For cosmetic packaging, there'll be Cristal Renew, et cetera. And those signify that there's recycled content in it. Nalgene and CamelBak are marketing it that way already. So, you can go look at those products. But yes, no, I think it's important that we get some sort of identification of it. Every customer is different.

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So, one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly. We got out of PET a long time ago. So, I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials, and then turning them in to durable products predominantly.",0.2383863,0.91

We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So, it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe. As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now, we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So, we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out.

And then, Mark, I'm sure it's refreshing to not have to talk about olefins and those things and talk about next-generation technology. Is there any way -- I mean, look at the number of questions on the call about it. Is there any way to ring fence it and then put it into a SPAC at a sales multiple that drives your earnings multiples, conceptually, could you do it?",0.292176,0.931
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,98,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We can just change our name to game stop. Not really, Bob. I mean, I think there's -- I think what we're doing is dramatically changing the portfolio of this company to -- I know it's a trend that everyone's saying this right now, but genuinely be more of an ESG play. When you look at -- for the last decade, we've been launching a wide range of products that are sustainable and much better for the environment across our portfolio. And now, you add on the circular economy and what we can do and how we could scale this up through partnerships. I think, we can really pivot the nature of who we are and the significant improvements we can make in our carbon footprint and drive towards that 30% reduction in 2030 is a huge change in our footprint, not to mention where we want to all get by 2050.",0.1629992,0.99

EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,104,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I would emphasize the ROIC in this one is unique compared to normal specialty investments because we can load the plant so fast. So the payback period is a lot faster for us in this one compared to normal where you're filling out a Tritan plan over time. Because we can baseload it with PET because we do still have some PET assets left that are dual purpose with our specialty plastics. And so, that gives us a lot of leverage in how we gain returns on the economics.",0.4576202,0.0
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,105,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, 20% is not necessarily the limit here, is…",1.1605542,0.659
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,106,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, we don't want to get into details. But, let's just leave it at that it's a very attractive investment.",0.4266504,-0.448
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,107,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And just as a follow-up, you're talking about using 250 million pounds of plastic waste by 2025, 500 million pounds by 2030. Should we think about this as a lower limit for growth that you're thinking about this business, or is it most likely scenario, or is this the upper limit? How high can it go within the next four years to nine years? And just a second part to this question, you were talking about $500 million to $1 billion in sales. Does this correspond to these two numbers, 250 million and 500 million?",0.0321923,0.899
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,108,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, those are interconnected. So, the type of waste plastic we're talking about getting to, if you think about the first methanolysis plant and what we think we're going to do with the CRT, that is what drives us towards that platform, revenue value of the $500 million to $1 billion. If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plans, that would be additive to those numbers. And, as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But, the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So, we're really excited. But, we still have a lot of work to do. I mean, the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have alternate process that we're currently using. But, it's more expensive and it's limited capacity. So, it's a way to, if you will, have a semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So, that we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So, we just need to catch up now.",1.1548492,0.318
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,110,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's Eric Petrie on for P.J. You noted the methanolysis plant has capacity of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of polymer per year. I'm assuming most of that will go into Tritan. So, at the fill out point, how much of your Tritan will be renewed versus traditional produce-based?",0.00489,0.948
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,111,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"First of all, it's not all Tritan. So, Tritan, I think, will be one of the big success stories, but it's not limited to that. So, we have a lot of copolyesters that go into cosmetic packaging, for example, that has a significant amount of value for that space who are very forward-leaning on the sustainability front, who are very interested in adopting recycled content. So, it's across that. There's even some shrink packaging that we may do. And so, there's a wide range of products in markets, but it will be a good portion of the Tritan mix, but we're not going to call out a percentage right now.",0.0757946,0.309
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,112,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. And then, secondly, how did volumes for your specialty products grow in fourth quarter? And what was the comp for full year '20? Typically, those end markets grow 2 times underlying.",0.1968215,0.995
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,113,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, the whole 2 times math gets a little confusing in a COVID crisis on how to actually measure it. But, what we -- we've seen -- you've seen tremendous growth and progress and success in the Advanced Materials division. And that's all the specialty products delivering that growth when you look at that volume and mix improvement. When you look at AFP, it's really important to sort of separate out the two-thirds versus the one-third. Obviously, the two-thirds is a lot more stable, margins well above the segment average. And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the two-thirds will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so, that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So, we got a lot of great businesses doing well there. And that comment, by the way, both on earnings and strong growth goes back to '18. So, the stability of that segment and the margins are actually quite good, offset, of course, by what we've identified in the tires and adhesives where we're taking some actions. But, overall, the portfolio on the volume side is actually holding up quite well.",0.3528932,0.0
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,115,Question,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Congratulations on all the progress. I'm just curious, Mark, you guys laid out an 8% to 12% EPS growth rate in the past. I know that '21, obviously, is going to be much above that because of the recovery. But, when you look long term and you add in the methanolysis gains, do you see a path to returning to that level structurally longer term or maybe even eclipsing that?",0.1075795,0.985
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,116,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, right now, we're still focused on recovery and getting back to '18 levels, which I do think is a pathway we can see after we get through this year. I think we're already on a strong track with what we've guided for this year. When you think about post recovery, let's say, and I'm not going to try and predict when that is with COVID, we very much would expect to get back to that growth math that we described on at Innovation Day of that 8% to 12%. Obviously, circular economy helps that and drives growth. Obviously, we've had things that haven't worked out as well as we had hoped like, tires and adhesive. So you got to sort of do all that net math, which we're not doing at this stage. But we definitely see the set of activities, the great things that are happening in many parts of the portfolio, a few things that didn't work out as we had hoped, allows us to still get back to '18 and grow from there with that math.",0.3349633,0.0
EMN-2020-Q4-2021-01-29,118,Answer,2021-01-29,4,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, as we think about capital allocation for '21, first and foremost, obviously, we grew our dividend for the 11th year in a row and expect to allocate about $375 million there. Also, we've got some debt coming due in Q4, and we would expect currently to pay that debt down, so, $300 million of debt reduction. And then also looking through with the remaining cash from a strategic standpoint, we would expect to allocate roughly $350 million between bolt-ons and share repurchases. Obviously, we're going to be, I'll call it, cautious offsetting dilution here in the front half, and we'll see how the economy continues to pick up.",0.0440098,0.99

Riddle,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"And just to sort of wrap things up, one last thing I wanted to say was, I have a deep appreciation to my employees and our leaders throughout the world. The success we had in getting through '20 in a very stable manner compared to many in the industry and to emerge and grow like we intend to do this year is a testament to all the investments we've made in our capabilities. I mean, we've made a lot of investment in commercial capabilities, a lot of investments in improving our operational cost structure. We've obviously dramatically changed our portfolio and improved its quality and depth of innovation and ability to create its own growth compared to the last recession we faced in 2009-2010. And we're seeing the payoff of that in the stability we delivered last year and the strong free cash flow and actually quite good earnings, especially if you back out the $100 million of additional inventory actions, and feel great about how we're positioned for this year.

EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,91,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E.

EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,92,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So what we're looking at now for - if you look at 2020, that kind of discipline is going to be maintained. So we're kind of looking at -- if you think about that, $1 billion to $1.1 billion and let's just take the midpoint of $1.050 billion. So $350 million of it will go kind of towards that increasing dividend that we're very proud of. Greater than $400 million will be used to reduce debt at a minimum.

This environment requires us to be thoughtful about what options makes sense. Certainly, we're looking at everything we can do on the restructuring front, and driving both innovation as well as how it optimizes the cost structure in this environment, and then we're looking at partnering and divestment options, as things we consider.",0.0036675,0.946

I think we've seen channels destock in Advanced Materials. I think the destocking has run its course, and even maybe a little bit of stabilization and inventory management, in a few of those businesses. In AFP, I'd say it's mostly destocked in the channels and we're more looking at where primary demand goes at this point.",4.1807864,0.402

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As I mentioned ag & Functional means and CI is one place where you could see some additional destocking here in the first quarter. We do believe in net volume growth for that business, assuming a normal weather pattern here in North America, but it may not be as dramatic as we still have a bit of inventory to work off.",0.6112687,0.202
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,103,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"But I would say in North America, where the economy has been stronger, there is probably people sitting on a bit more inventory than where Asian and European customers are. So there is always a risk, if the U.S. economy slows down, you could see a better destocking there.",0.1370085,0.527
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,104,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So we'll just have to see how it plays out.

If you look at Advanced Materials, the main driver of their growth continues to be innovation and volume growth, and then there is an opportunity to really keep pricing off of what we'd call the product performance. There is some input costs that do vary, and they did have some tailwind in 2019. I think some of that will moderate, but it will still be there.",2.1886716,0.751

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we did an acquisition at Sterling, the Texas City site, which is just a phenomenal site, when you look at the scale, infrastructure, ports, rail everything. It's just a great opportunity to leverage, and this is a great example - one of I think several that will have at Texas City, and how we can sort of provide that site opportunity and the Gulf Coast Ammonia and the Air Products project set a great example of what several other opportunities could look like.",0.2815811,0.972
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,142,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I'd see multiple things there.

I think you will also see that we moderated our dividend as our dividend payout ratio is - I'll call it, gotten back in line with where we would expect it to be, post the Solutia and Taminco acquisition. and as we think about future growth, we will continue to grow it, but it will be based on the long-term expectation, consistent with how we have in the past.",0.5443859,0.392

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So as I said in our outlook statement, our outlook statement does not include the impact of the Corona virus. I think it's -- we can all agree it's a little too early to call what those impacts were going to be. But most importantly, we're focused on safety and health of the people in China as well as around the world, including our employees, and making sure we're taking the right set of actions which we've implemented around controlling travel within China, travel in and out of China and making sure people are as safe as possible.",0.2135289,0.954

EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,155,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I don't think it's a simple conclusion though, where you just look at the impact of what's going to happen to demand in China, which obviously will occur.

So it's mostly about the pig population that was hit by the African swine flu. It's hard to give exact numbers, but somewhere around 30% to 50% reduction in that population, which is a huge consumer of these organic acids, that we and some others sell.",1.366437,0.372

So we've been in the background working that with them, and they're close to success in the first license. These licenses are quite large and significant in the scale of what plants will be built.

EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,167,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I think it's a great opportunity for sort of multiple licenses as we go forward.

EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,192,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah, the way I'd characterize it, where you are seeing that right now is kind of in the margin. So while we were able to implement the cost reduction actions, those cost reduction actions are harder to see COGS and our margins, is because we had to slow down our plans.",0.5593839,0.296
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,193,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We don't give our specific utilization rates etc, but when you get our 10-K, you'll see that our finished goods in intermediate products in inventory declined 5%. Some of that is value, but also some of its --- some of the slowdown we did in our production rates.",0.1244426,0.477
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,194,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And Bob, I'd just add that we're going to be careful about how we run our plants as we go into the first half of this year. So that volume growth is a way to sort of move inventory down and continue -- making progress on that. It's a great opportunity for us to release a lot of cash as we go forward.",0.4329145,0.921
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,197,Question,2020-01-31,4,2019,Laurence Alexander,Jefferies,"Good morning. Can you give a sense for the recycling technologies, what commodity environments would not be competitive? And secondly, I may have missed this, in terms of the spreads stabilizing in the middle to back half of the year, are you seeing competitor shutdowns helping improve the prospect for the spreads or is it purely tied to your perspective on end market demand?",0.3504615,0.811
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,198,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. Good questions. So the first one on the Circular Economy, at this point with the trends in the marketplace, it's not as much about competing against the price of oil or fossil fuel feedstocks. The train has left the station, right, you've got legislation in Europe and coming in multiple other jurisdictions of banning single use plastics or putting what they call EPRs, Enhanced Producer Responsibility, which is basically taxes on single use plastic.",0.5154849,0.586
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,199,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the drive for recycling and the value that it's putting on it, is creating a real cost choice, not just a consumer preference choice for brands around the world. Even China now is banning plastic bags in all major cities by the end of this year for groceries and things like that.",0.4429503,0.727
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,200,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the recycled content part, we're really excited about what we're doing, is a critical differentiator for us. Fortunately, we got out of the single use plastic business, so we're not trying to defend it, when we got rid of the PET business in 2011. We're more focused on how we provide solutions to customers around the actual recycled content, as well as put our recycled content in finished products and durables, so whole another differentiation back to Vince's questions earlier, is not only do we have a lot of product differentiation in the performance of the product, we now have a whole new vector of growth in specialty plastics, as well as over in textiles and fibers, by putting recycled content in these products, which is a very significant demand.",0.0717196,0.878
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,201,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we do think that we will get a premium relative to fossil fuel-based products, for providing these solutions to the marketplace. You can look at rPET through last year in Europe, they traded at roughly a 60% premium to PET in the marketplace. I think that's a bit high.",0.3312958,0.178
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,202,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But we do think on a long-term basis and we do think our technologies provide real solutions, because we can access feedstock that's going to landfill not compete against some mechanical recycled streams.",0.1784841,0.178
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,203,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the cost structure for us will be more advantaged for our feedstock, because it has no alternative value, and that's an important differentiator for what we're doing. So we feel really good about that and we feel like, we're in a good differentiated position to sort of move those programs forward in both AM and fibers.",0.3545232,0.911
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,204,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second question was on spreads in the back half of last year. As we said, you know, spreads declined through the back half relative to the first half of '19, as people realize that the economy was not going to improve with the settlement of the trade war, and so that elongated economic stress led to a more competitive behavior, in particular, CI and that one-third of AFP.",0.3732681,-0.797
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,205,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In CI, we do see prices very much stabilizing out relative to competitors, who are hitting their cash cost in Asia. So we have seen that, and we are seeing people will start moderating run rates or potentially shut down plants temporarily. I'm not sure I think any of these plants are going to shut down permanently.",0.4629177,-0.241
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,206,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So when the market recovers, some of these people will come back in the marketplace, which is why we've been cautious on how we think about spreads this year and we're assuming spreads do not improve this year. And so I think we're in a good place there.",0.1625917,0.024
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,210,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So you're correct polyester benefited from lower PX prices. The olefins benefited from lower ethane and propane prices, as well as a propylene supply contract that's formulated to propane. So we saw a raw material benefits in the olefin chain. On the asset yield chain, we are coal-based on how we make our asset yields with our gasifier, coal prices have been relatively stable, so there wasn't any tailwind there.",1.0599022,0.758
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,216,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"They did. So we had a good October, we had a weak November that gave us some concern about what might happen in December. And then both volume came in better than expected and cost came in quite a bit better than expected on the raw material side.",0.8867156,0.724
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,218,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Gregory A. Riddle,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Let's make the next question our last one, please.",2.3854523,0.318
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,221,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so first of all through '19, the two-thirds did quite well as Curt laid out, prices were relatively flat outside of the cost pass-through contracts, and we expect that continue this year, where prices will be stable and we saw a raw material benefits as a result, we saw volume growth and we have this headwind, especially in these high-value additives for automotive in China net out to being modestly down for last year.",0.2351263,0.875
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,222,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So as we look at this year, we see volume, we see raws stable as well as pricing, so that's going to deliver some growth as well as some cost reduction. So you do see some earnings growth in the two-third side of the portfolio. And you're correct, the potential for down net earnings for the AFP segment is in the one-third segment, as we take in those lower spreads from the back half of last year.",0.4458028,0.813
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,223,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We do regain some volume, so as we had good discipline on pricing through the first half of 2019, we lost some volume in adhesives and tires, regaining that with some pricing in the fourth quarter.",0.3732681,0.153
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,224,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So will have a volume improvement, but some pricing down net in the one-third, as well as you're going to have some earnings challenges there, just given where spreads are at this point. So I think you're directionally correct.",0.0977995,0.625
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,226,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're well positioned capacity. We had doubled the capacity in 2018, because we had run our capacity, because the volume growth had been so strong. This was one of several plants that we brought online in 2018, where volume was really great, across AFP and AM, with the growth we've been having, until the trade war hit. So we're well positioned to support growth there.",0.50815,0.955
EMN-2019-Q4-2020-01-31,227,Answer,2020-01-31,4,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And if I could add, Mike, that's an example for this business, not only you get volume growth, you get mix upgrade, and now you get fixed cost leverage as well.",0.647345,0.572

Despite challenging short-term dynamics in the last few months of 2018, I'm proud of our accomplishments for the full year. We delivered 6% top-line growth driven by strong volume growth in our specialty businesses with contributions from product lines across our portfolio.

This was underpinned by continued growth across a diverse set of end markets and double-digit growth in China, despite the headwinds from the trade dispute. In performance films, we once again delivered double-digit volume growth in our two largest markets for window films, North America and China. We also continue to build momentum in paint protection film with the launch of two next-generation products. Also in AM, our interlayer business continue to benefit from our innovations in automotive with our products and heads-up display growing at 25% in 2018.

And we were delivering these results despite $240 million of higher raw material and distribution cost, historically low spot ethylene prices and higher costs resulting from increased growth investments and the industrial gas supplier disruptions in Texas.

And given the large drop in Brent beginning in October, we had a harder time raising our prices, but we still had $90 million of higher raw material and distribution costs year-over-year due to the third quarter flowing through our inventories.

In the fourth quarter, sales revenue decreased mostly due to customer inventory destocking in specialty plastics as a result of economic uncertainty created by the U.S.-China trade dispute.

In auto, both interlayers and performance films grew faster than the global auto market due to their breadth of innovation products. And in the architecture market, which now represents just under 50% of the interlayer sales, we are seeing strong growth particularly in Europe as we benefit from trends towards more windows in commercial architecture trends we are well positioned to serve.",1.5200649,0.939

While orders in January have improved sequentially, we expect some inventory destocking to persist in the first quarter, impacting our specialty plastics business. We also expect higher cost in paraxylene to flow through inventory, temporarily impacting margins in the first quarter. And we will not face the same step-up in growth costs as a headwind coming into 2019. As those issues moderate, we expect Advanced Materials to return to robust growth in the final three quarters of the year.

While we see a pickup in orders, we still expect some destocking in tires and coatings to continue in the first quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect to return to growth as raw materials become a tailwind, destocking plays out and we don't expect the same cost headwinds as last year.

First, we've largely mitigated the merchant ethylene headwind with the completion of our RGP project. And second, we do not expect to have a large industrial gas supplier outages repeat in 2019. The lack of these headwinds were netted with some expected softening in acetyls and in some olefin derivative products in 2019, lead us to expect 2019 Chemical Intermediates EBIT to be similar with 2018.",1.1151196,-0.318

Looking at the full year, sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume, primarily due to continued growth in the textiles innovation products and non-woven products previously reported in other.

Tow volumes were relatively flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, sales revenue increased due to continue strong volume growth in textiles innovation products and higher sales volumes primarily to non-woven innovation products, previously reported in other.

First, we have fairly good line of sight into customer order patterns in this business. We are also not qualified to shift into China from our tow plant in Korea mitigating some of the impact we discussed last quarter associated with shipping tow into China from the U.S. We expect stability in 2019 as we continue to stabilize tow and benefit from strong textiles volume growth that builds throughout the year, which offsets the gradual decline in the tow market. But different from past years, the first tow quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter for tow due to customer buying patterns, partially attributed to rebuilding in imports into China and few other customers. All in, we expect EBIT to be about the same in 2019 compared with 2018.",0.8005675,0.848

Cash from operating activities was over $1.5 billion and free cash flow came in close to target added approximately $1.1 billion. We continue to demonstrate our ability to convert earnings into cash and manage our working capital.

We have a number of growth drivers as we enter the year. As I mentioned earlier, we were doing a great job of driving new business revenue, as we leverage our innovation driven growth model.

In 2019, we're also managing a few headwinds. As we've mentioned, we expect global growth to be slower this year, due to China trade issues and the European economy slowed down with Brexit and other concerns.

Given what we know today, growth would likely be towards the bottom end of this range. We're calling that our Innovation Day in February of our last year. Our long-term EPS growth projection was in the range of 8% to 12%. The difference between the midpoint of our long-term range and the range I just gave you for 2019 is primarily due to the lower expected earnings in the first quarter, due to raw material flow through and the destocking playing out and the substantial currency headwind we face.",2.0937245,0.802

On Slide 12, what you see is our innovation-driven growth model, which we first discussed with you at the Innovation Day last February and I've referenced a number of times this morning. This model is central to our winning strategy and given the progress that we've made, we're confident we're on track.

We want to solve the waste crisis, but we also need to be sensitive to climate at the same time, and there's no toxic waste. So it is a great story that they want to embrace and have in their brands.

EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,37,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that factors into your pricing strategy. And so, we want to have stability for us in our spreads and as much as possible for our customers in pricing with the dynamics of raw materials.

If you go back to 2018, as a reference point, that was a very strong raw material environment, in fact, stronger so far than this year when we look at year-over-year increase and what we expect. And we're able to maintain price increases and maintain stable spreads relative to '17, the back half of that year. And that was the strongest earnings year we had until this year.",0.807661,0.189

So '19 and '20 with the impact of COVID and before that, the China trade war, we saw a pretty significant drop in volume and mix, it also led to drop in raw material prices and shared some of that with customers, but we still expanded spreads to offset some of that volume and mix headwind that we had.",1.2286064,0.0

EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,41,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So making good progress in improving spreads to offset some of those headwinds and getting back towards that '18 level, so that, I think, is a great story and one that you want to do because the story for us on the specialties is volume and mix improvement is really significant.

So I mean, first of all, it's obviously a pretty significant improvement in our outlook today from where we were in January. And Mike, that's really driven by a material improvement in the volume and mix growth that we're seeing -- saw in the first quarter, but the momentum we're seeing going into this quarter and into the back end of the year.

The operational transformation program is doing a great job of offsetting the return of short-term actions we took last year. And remember, that's over a $200 million program that doesn't just help this year, but also will help going into '22, so we feel good about that.

It feels like you guys are ahead in molecular recycling compared to your competitors who are working in polyethylene. I guess Eastman Kodak had some great technologies, and then congrats on your Barron's ranking as well. I guess how much -- my question is, how much is the conversion cost for a new PET lower than regular PET? And I know it's a long ramp-up and you've got to get customer qualifications and all that, but if you take a long-term view, Mark, let's say, by 2030, how much PET could you replace with recycled, molecular recycled PET? Just any guess could be helpful.",1.4237979,-0.752
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,58,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So as is I said, we're really excited about methanolysis and where we think it can take us. And we are trying to be a leader to demonstrate that the plastic waste crisis can be solved within plastic. Plastic is in many applications, by far, the best product for the market. It has the lowest carbon footprint versus alternative materials whether it's glass, paper, aluminum, in many cases. So we want to keep plastic being the best solution for climate by far. And -- but we got address the waste crisis. So we do have to have a way of scaled up, and I think we're demonstrating how to do that.",1.792991,0.872
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,59,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's important to remember that we're upscaling plastic waste into durable applications. We're not trying to sort of defend a large single-use plastic business and what we're doing. So that allows us to get a lot of incremental growth in durables at high values as well as better margins. And so, we haven't been focused in this first investment on really leaning in on the PET business. From a cost point of view, to answer to your question, the costs are modestly higher than PET or co-polyesters today at oil prices around where they are today.",0.5061125,0.0
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,60,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"If oil prices go up, that equation changes on a relative cost basis. And what we see is a real detachment now from this business from the sort of fuel stock market, right? When you look at PET trading at 60%, 80% premiums to -- in our PET relative to fossil fuel PET in Europe, you know that there's a completely different economic proposition going on around recycled PET or recycled specialty polyesters that we're making.",1.0668297,0.762
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,61,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But we do think there's a significant opportunity to scale this up. And in fact, we don't just have customers calling us around wanting our specialty products for what we can do with recycled content. We also have customers talking to us about how we could significantly scale up and make PET for their needs around packaging. We have customers calling us. We have peers calling us. We have governments calling us and asking us, can you sort of work with us to solve this problem. And so we're engaging in those conversations and trying to figure out which set of those opportunities makes the most sense for us.",1.6381418,0.707

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I want to be very clear for everyone who's listening, we are not getting back into the normal PET business that we got out of it in 2011. We're staying out of it. So if we choose to get back, it's going to be more of an airgas model on how we engage with solving this problem and scaling up, which means that we'll provide technology, construction, operations, feedstock sourcing. And as we build multiple plants, we'll have all the operational technical know-how that gives us an advantage in how we can do all that for our potential partners.",1.2245314,0.762

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We will have long-term contracts to secure all the demand that -- where we will not take market volatility risk relative to feedstock prices. And both from a capital allocation point of view, we'll likely be more of an equity participation in partnerships as opposed to putting this entirely on our balance sheet. So very different model, more like air gas, and we'll see how those conversations go. I think the need is there. Lots of people are making very significant commitments. In Europe, they're facing very significant taxes.",1.1801141,0.34

And then coming back to more nitty-gritty, on CI, as I understood after the Texas freeze, as ethylene and other commodities spiked, propylene prices collapsed by 50% because I think refinery started up before the polypropylene plant started up. And so I guess it's hard to understand from outside, but I would have expected a benefit from lower refinery grade propylene for you and higher propylene derivative prices. But can you just explain what happened with the propylene chain? And what was the benefit? Or why do you see we see more?",1.5289324,0.956
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,66,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, sure. P.J., so first of all, we don't sell propylene, right? We sell derivatives from propylene as you just noted. And so, we saw very strong pricing momentum before you were hit in all of our grids because the market conditions were tight. Obviously, you remade the markets even tighter. And as a result, those derivative prices have held up quite well, and they're going to continue to increase, increase in a pretty significant way into the second quarter.",1.3202934,0.869
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,67,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You have to remember that most of our propylene is made from propane that we buy, RGP being converted into propylene and some supply agreements that are propane based in their pricing, not propylene based. So we're not buying a lot of merchant propylene in our total feed mix. So -- and the spreads are good and attractive. The driver markets continue to remain tight.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's also important to note at the segment level, when you're trying to interpret these results in CI, there's more than olefins in this segment. So 25% of our revenue is actually functional amines, which has had a tremendous and very steady track record of improving earnings from '18 through to now and is on to a great track. And the vast majority of that business is on cost pass-through contracts. Same is true with a number of our acetic and hydro customers.",0.6511817,0.153
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,69,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so our strategy is to have stable earnings in CI, not to have really volatile ones as we're trying to be more of a specialty company, more predictable in our earnings and cash flow. That gave us stability in '19 and '20 relative to '18. And it's going to give us stability this year, but we're not going to be popping up on spot prices as much as some others.",0.1316218,0.59

EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,72,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Jeff, thanks for the question. We are very focused on the value of vertical integration. As you just noted, it creates a lot of stability for us. So in our polyester chains, ethyl chains and olefin chains, that's, for the most part, a way we provide significant reliability to our customers that compare it to some of our competitors. And through the first quarter, I received a number of calls from a very important large customers thanking us for our demonstrated reliability that they deeply appreciated and how well we got through the storm and supplied them.",1.1560717,-0.376
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,73,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the one place that we're not vertically integrated is from acetyl to our interlayers. We don't make VAM and rely on market suppliers for VAM. So the shortages that we saw, there has created a constraint for us in interlayers. It is specific to the interlayer business. But we were already having sort of supply problems with some acetyl unreliability in the fourth quarter.

And while they're back operational, they're not near full rates. So it's really created a pretty significant global VAM shortage, as you know.

And obviously, very impressive growth in the Performance Films area and Advanced Materials overall and I think you said 15% volume growth.

The recovery of AM was substantial, and a good part of that was Asia coming back to life.

EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,85,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we were going against a really tough comp. But AM was one place that did face challenges in Asia. Supply chain and interlayers is really short, as an example, and as well as buying films on cars. So that led to some of the spike up. Demand trending-wise, though, has held up really well, so well, Asia recovery. And we had growth in North America and Europe as well in the quarter.",1.49674,0.765
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,86,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J.

Obviously, your Dallas competitor had a great quarter, looking at a great year in that space. Your footprint is different. Can you talk about your strategic footprint in acetyls? Do you need to back integrate more into VAM over time? And then what are some of the other acetyl derivatives? And how much are they offsetting the hit from the VAM side if you look outside of tow on some of your other downstream derivatives, if you could kind of just net out the acetyls chain for us this year.",0.999185,0.669
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,94,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Sure. So trying to do comparisons of our steel business to our friends in Dallas is not a very good exercise because their business is just entirely different than ours. So they're extremely large player in acetic acid, and then they go forward into VAM and emulsions that obviously are enjoying exceptionally tight market conditions and high prices right now. We don't make -- we make a DC and hydride is what we make off of our stream that goes into cellulosic products as well as a variety of other acetyl or polyester products or olefin products where there's an acetyl component, but we don't go into that VAM emotion business at all.",1.201304,-0.291
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,95,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if you want to look at our total integrated acetyl stream, including all the specialties that we make in Advanced Materials and AFP and fibers, the margins that we have and the stability of those margins is extremely attractive, but if you want to just look at in isolation and what we do in CI, which is silicon hydride that isn't being used for making specialties. We're selling the co-product of acetic acid for when we make cellulosics. That business is limited to those market conditions.",0.9873676,0.637

We do lock out in sort of stable cost passer contracts and high drive and that gives us nice stable earnings, but it doesn't allow us to have big pops or drops in that profitability from year-to-year. So it's totally different. So from a vertical integration point of view, the place where we're not vertically integrated is when we bought Solutia and picked up the interlayers business that buys VAM and PVOH as the raw materials.",1.2286064,-0.493

As we're trying to keep our auto customer or glass customers in the auto OEM supply.,0.4233904,0.642
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,98,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Perfect. And then maybe just one since it got highlighted with the acquisition around animal health. Can you size your animal health business as it sits going forward? And then where is your leverage both geographically and to different animals species, chicken versus hogs versus cattle? How should we think about that going forward?",1.109617,0.0
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,99,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Willie will answer the first and I'll take the second.,1.5484923,0.382
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,100,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So you can think about it as roughly 10% of outages and functional products overall and looking forward to the accelerated growth that we believe that this acquisition will add.,1.3981255,0.925
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,101,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the trends in animal nutrition are pretty significant and really attractive. As most of you probably know, gut health and growth promotion in animals is obviously very, very important. Historically, we use antibiotics to do it. And most people want antibiotic-free meat and protein. And so there's a switch to organic assets.",0.9690302,0.847
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,102,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We have the broadest portfolio organic assets for this market area. But we don't do a lot of formulation of those products. So this acquisition, combined with investments we've been making over the last several years in our sort of formulation and application development capability can dramatically accelerate our ability to actually formulate more comprehensive solutions to these challenges and leverage that growth.",1.0709046,0.915
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,103,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the formulations get significantly higher value than selling the assets by two to four times depending on the application. So it's a real classic mixed play for our strategy everywhere else in our company, of creating higher value formulations, capturing a lot more value for that solution to our customers.",0.5493073,0.657
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,104,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And this acquisition brings in a lot of capability and a nice existing marketplace in Spain of products that we can then take around the globe given our broader commercial footprint. So there's a huge upside just on our global sales capability relative to their focus on Spain.,0.9739201,0.318
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,106,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Mark, in Advanced Materials, given the further step-up in margins this quarter, can you discuss the margin profile of this business going forward, both through '21 as well as beyond?",1.193969,0.785
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,107,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"David, great to here from you, and thanks for the question, so I think the margin profile for Advanced Materials speaks for itself if you want to look at the last decade, right? Just dramatic improvement, we said this, I remember having these conversations back in 2010, '11, where we made a lot of investments in asset capability and application development capability, but we added a lot of fixed cost, built Tritan.",1.2151589,0.906
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,108,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we said, look, when this starts to sell and grow, the fixed cost leverage is going to be incredibly impressive. If you go back to the 2018 Innovation Day presentation of materials, we laid it all out for you on how fixed cost leverage works in this business. So in that sense, I think as we look at the margins this year, which will be quite attractive. And as we go forward, we think these margins will continue to improve.",0.8887531,0.787
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,109,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now they're not going to improve like they did from '20 to '21, obviously, because we took such a hit on asset utilization, especially in Advanced Materials as we're pulling inventory down in interlayers and performance films. You have to remember, specialty plastics actually grew earnings last year relative to '19. So they provided nice stability relative to the auto exposure we had in interlayers and PF.",1.2351263,0.953
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,110,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But as we continue to grow the circular economy, which is a value up and better margins, as we continue to grow products like Tritan and everything else, whether it's the paint protection films or pretty much anything in performance films has very attractive margins. The acoustics, heads-up display interlayers, very attractive. Electronic vehicles are another big lever for us where we see significant upside.",0.7836186,0.077
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,111,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it turns out to need a lot more glass than an EV. When you put batteries that our need people, the head goes up into the ceiling of the car because you don't want to raise the roof hike because of Aerodynamics. And so what they're doing is making windshield bigger and putting on bigger sun roofs to not make the cabin claustrophobic. So we're getting a lot more real estate of the car in glass with every EV. And then they have much higher functionality requirements in that space.",1.5700896,0.832
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,112,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So they want better acoustics. When you don't have the engine noise, which is sort of white noise, you now have more other noises that people focus on, they're more sensitive to, and you actually have to not just have more acoustic, but you have to be able to have the capability to tune it to different frequency bands. They still want heads-up display for safety reasons. They want more color that they're using in parts of the windows as part of how they're adding more glass.",0.9898126,-0.13
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,113,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And they want solar rejection to reduce air conditioning load. So all these functionalities in, it takes tremendous technical sophistication to put all that functionality into 1 interlayer. And we're the world leader in how to do that. And so when we look at EVS, it's probably two to three times more value per car that we're capturing.",1.2220864,0.946
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,114,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we already have some great adoption on some of these products with a very significant leader in this space. And we expect that to continue across all the brands. So we see volumes growing, mix growing, cost being controlled, spreads being managed, as I discussed earlier. And so the earnings growth will improve and the margins will incrementally improve year-to-year.",0.3573757,0.493
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,118,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Mark, you spoke about good demand for methanolysis-based polymers. At what point could you start thinking about additional investments in capacity? Would you have to, you think, turn on and run your initial capacity, your initial plan? Or could you think about expansions sometime earlier if demand continues to be so strong?",1.4490628,0.305
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,119,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'm sorry. I was just a little bit hard to hear your questions. So I'm going to repeat it back to make sure I got it correctly. So are you saying what capacity would we need beyond the first 100,000 ton methanolysis plant? And when would we have that?",0.6128769,0.73
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,120,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'm sorry, Mark. Let me repeat this. Demand for methanolysis-based products is strong. So at what point would you start thinking about additional expansions? Or can you possibly start thinking about additional expansion of capacity? Do you think you have to start-up the plant first and see how it works? Or if demand is strong enough, could you think about expansions maybe sometime in the next 12 months or so?",1.8325183,0.34
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,121,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So we're not going to wait to start this plant up before we start, building another plant necessarily. I mean it will depend on the demand we see for our products internally. And it will depend on this partnership conversation. I mentioned earlier about how we're talking to people about building additional plants around the world that would be focused more on PET than our specialty plastics, but we could take a stream of that output and use it for specialty plastics if we wanted to.",1.4735126,0.915
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,122,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But for sure, if you ask me where are we going to be 5, 10 years from now, our goal, as we said in the sustainability report last December, is to make all of our cellulosic plastics and our polyesters from plastic waste. That's our long-term goal. So we're not stopping at this first plant. And we're -- and what we're seeing so far gives us great confidence that, that vision is possible. It's a very attractive return for shareholders.",0.1279544,0.97
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,123,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We get better margins. We get to accelerate growth of our highest value products, and it's just a great story. So yes, I expect we'll be building more than this plant. But we're focused on doing this plant well first and having success in filling it up and seeing if this alternative business model is something that's going to work with customers and partners.",1.699674,0.62
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,124,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would also note that, that's not our only sustainability play. We've been the original biopolymer company, right? We've been making cellulose acetate for over 100 years and brought it into a wide range of products. So it's a sustainable biopolymer. It's biodegradable in a lot of applications. And now we have a very unique capability on the planet to add recycle content to the other half of that polymer, right?",1.2950285,0.493
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,125,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So half of it is made from certified and sustainable forest, the other half today is obviously made from fossil fuels in acetic and hydride to make those cellulosic products. As we add recycled content to the other half of it, it's an extremely compelling polymer compared to anything else on the market because it's biopolymer, it's biodegradable, and it has recycled content in it. And based on a wide spectrum of waste plastic, including our ability to take back products from our customers like textiles, right?",1.5986145,0.933
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,126,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So now it's just been a phenomenal growth story for us this year and especially in how fast it's recovered in the first quarter. And it's just got a great story as a biopolymer that's led to a lot of success, and now we're adding the renew recycled content part of it to the story. And we expect just a tremendous amount of growth of that. And there's a bunch of cellulosic plastics and advanced materials that we see in the durable space.",1.3875306,0.947
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,127,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we also think there's probably significant upside in the single-use plastics space as well. And that's a very early stage. So that's a whole another dimension of growth at better margins, higher value, great asset leverage to our existing capacity because there, we don't have to add capital, it's just leveraging existing capability and capacity.",0.8887531,0.761
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,136,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But we're well set up and focused. So that was variable margins that we talked about last year fall through to the bottom line. Obviously, there'll be a little bit of denominator math just due to the price inflations that we're dealing with.",1.9246129,0.751
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,137,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Bob, overall headcount is down. So between the assets we shut down around the world as well as some headcount optimization that we've done last year, the headcount is actually down. I'm not sure where you got the -- it's flat part.",0.1850041,0.536
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,138,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I was looking at the 10-K. Maybe I just misread it. Mark, I did want to ask, it's been a long time since you did a blockbuster deal. And it appears that you're starting to get the traction on the EBITDA run rate, the earnings run rate. You have enough stuff on the organic plate to keep you busy and excited? Or do we start to put on the radar screen, maybe it's -- you deserve the right to do something big again?",1.5733496,0.97
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,139,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So first of all, we love our portfolio and the innovation that we have in front of us, Bob, and it's producing very attractive earnings and exceptionally attractive cash flow. And we see a lot of innovation, positioning us to continue growth into '22. We also like the markets that we're in, and we still think there's market recovery in front of us in '22 and beyond in things like aviation, automotive. So the volume mix story, I think, will continue.",1.3724531,0.912
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,140,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The balance sheet is obviously getting stronger. And we're going to have tailwinds next year as we go into that year with cost reductions, so all of that feels good. And our balance sheet is getting into better shape. Our strategy continues to be focused on what can we do organically, what bolt-on M&As make a lot of sense to add to what we're trying to do and buy back stock with the remainder of the cash. So that's our strategy now, and that's what we're going to stay focused on doing.",1.4152404,0.318
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,142,Question,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I'll ask just one here. Mark, methanolysis has overshadowed the activity you're doing on processing waste plastic in the gasifier. Have you taken that as far as it can go? And can you help other gasify our operators process plastic waste?",1.1585167,0.881
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,143,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So we're really excited about what we're doing with the gasifier and changing it from gasifying coal to what's technically called reforming plastic. And so that plastic waste, we're just getting started, Bob. It's got huge growth potential. That's the speech I just gave a moment ago about biopolymers and all the opportunities we see to grow in specialty plastics as well as in textiles.",0.5256724,0.896
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,144,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the great good news is it's incremental capital to continue adding plastic waste. And the great thing about the gasifier is that it can take any kind of plastic waste. Mixed plastic waste, which is great. It gives us a unique advantage in buying raw materials because we can buy a puddle of plastic and then separate out the polyester and put in the methanolysis and put the remainder into the gas fire, which gives us the ability to buy very low-cost feedstock that hasn't been into cleaned up.",1.4718826,0.711
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,145,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we're really excited about that. So no, we see a tremendous amount of growth in that space, as excited about that as methanolysis and what we can do with our polymer capacity, and we have a lot of capacity to leverage. So no, it's going to be great. As far as working with other people, we're not focused on that right now. To your second part of the question, we're -- at the moment, we're really just trying to deal with all the inbounds on the methanolysis side that's taking a pull of our resources.",0.702119,0.318
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,149,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Also, what we're trying to do there, Laurence, is that frees up capacity as we create the incremental gains to continue to fund our growth without substantially growing our cost structure. So that's the way I would frame it at this point. And we continue to also look at leveraging assets and sites, et cetera, to continue to gain better fixed cost leverage where we have additional capabilities as we've highlighted previously.",0.8651182,0.636
EMN-2021-Q1-2021-04-30,150,Answer,2021-04-30,1,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But to assure you, we're not making any compromise on our growth portfolio. I mean even in '18, I mean, in '19 and '20 when we could have easily cut on R&D and innovation, we kept on doubling down and investing in those spaces because we knew that's our future. We, frankly, did the same thing in '08, '09, which allowed us to come out of that crisis extremely well in '10, '11.",1.3133659,0.918

EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,17,Question,2020-05-01,1,2020,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. I didn't see your prepared remarks, but I'm happy. I'm happy you're doing them, and I look forward to reading them in the future. I did just skim them. But with that said, Mark, I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit. I saw in the slides, you talked about April being down 15% versus March, and it sounds like March was worse than the other two months of the first quarter. But maybe you could just contextualize April? How much it's down versus the overall first quarter?",0.6119305,0.929
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,18,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So as we said in the slide, we really try to provide some perspective across the markets and sort of grouped them into three categories, Vincent. And it's good to hear you and you sound healthy as well. There are - about 40% of our markets are quite stable and doing quite well, being relatively flat sequentially.",1.4282804,0.912
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,19,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And in those markets, you've got things like personal care, consumables, which is a range of things from packaging adhesives to packaging polyesters, et cetera. The medical pharma parts good, ag, nutrition. And all those markets are going to hold up relatively well in this.",0.7110839,0.866
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,20,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Then you've got somewhat challenged markets that are like building construction, consumer durables, electronics, industrial chemicals, where they're actually still also sequentially declining, as you can see in April, but we expect those to continue to sort of do relatively okay to the more impacted ones in transportation, textiles and energy.",0.5766096,0.69
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,21,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So there really are three things. That diversity of end markets, especially that 40% that gives us a stability in the world is incredibly helpful in this time. And we would expect that to sort of continue through the quarter. The - what we call mixed impact are a little bit harder to call.",0.5387123,0.475
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,22,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think there's some of that, that's holding up well, like consumer durables, a lot of our innovation and Tritan and things like that are allowing us to create our own growth. So we're seeing stability from not just markets, but innovation in some of those applications. Architectural coatings is holding up really well as well as our architectural interlayers. But it's reasonable to expect some of that's going to moderate as existing projects might be completed, et cetera.",1.1365118,0.931
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,23,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But through Q2, I think it's going to be okay. The question is what happens longer-term to some new starts in housing. And then the real challenge, of course, is in transportation, which I think is extremely well documented, where you've got auto plants, tire plants shut down all over the world, fortunately, China coming back.",0.5961695,0.556
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,24,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But we track every tire plant, every auto OEM, every window plant down to the model and are mapping all that out. As you know, they're all shut down now. So the question is when are they going to start back up? And we see that recovery and that sequential improvement in China already, but obviously, U.S. and Europe is still a question mark.",0.9796251,0.25
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,25,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we've been conservative. We've assumed that the auto OEM market's going to be down, from an OEM production point of view, be down 50% for the quarter, which is on the sort of more pessimistic end of the range of the consultants out there. And that's really to inform our production and inventory strategy as opposed to trying to say we can predict earnings at this point given the uncertainty.",0.7383863,-0.669
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,26,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But - so we've been very aggressive in how we manage our plans for that. And we'll see how it recovers. So overall, I'd say April's a good indicator of the quarter. I think that we could expect it to be a bit more challenging in May as supply chain line catches up to us with a lot of these plants being shut down. And then we presume that, along with the consultants, that things will start back up to some degree. And so you'll see some of that benefit in June. Does that answer your question?",0.0215974,0.71
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,27,Question,2020-05-01,1,2020,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Yes. So just to recap, it sounds like you're saying being down 15% in April, sequentially, it's probably about right. It'll be a little worse in May, and may be a little bit better in June. But if we think sequentially between 2Q and 1Q, we could think about your volumes being down. I'm just going to say 15% to 20%. Is that fair?",0.9183874,0.614
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,28,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I mean, I think that's a range to start with. I just really want to emphasize for everyone, no one knows what's going to happen here, right? I mean, there's just a phenomenal amount of uncertainty when we don't even know how the U.S. and Europe are going to restart yet. And there's a lot of questions that we have to answer that go with that.",0.9747351,-0.46
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,29,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we can get people back to work in a lot of companies, but it's really a question of what consumers are going to do, are they going to go back to restaurants? Back to their more - normal life activities? Travel? Shop in retail stores? Buy cars?

We did have a very strong sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And it was really driven by four factors. The first was strong volume growth. So we saw strong improvement in ag, alkylamines, in - that market had been pretty depressed. There's a lot of destocking going on in the fourth quarter last year.",1.1894866,0.97

EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,38,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,The second was a lack of shutdowns. So we had a huge shutdown going on in the third and fourth quarter last year. A lot of that expense was in the fourth quarter. So we didn't have that. So that was a $20 million benefit in itself from Q4 to Q1.,0.9572127,0.505
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,39,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The third was an improvement in spreads. So we got our spreads back to being about where they were in Q1 2019. So that was a bit of an improvement from Q4. Some of it was cracking spreads, got better in January and February. Unfortunately, they started to compress a bit in March, but we got the benefit of that. And the last part was the licensing.",0.8357783,0.805
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,40,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, April, on a year-over-year basis, just to take that quick question first, was similar to sequential. And regards to the CI store, unfortunately, it's not going to hold up like it did in Q1. We do see some headwinds as we go into Q2.

So they're going to see that demand pressure on multiple markets. And in the current environment with the oil situation, a lot of what we would, sort of excess capacity, we would export to Asia after serving sort of North American, European markets, is to sort of run the assets totally full. Those markets - those export markets aren't as available. Asia still hasn't come really back to the life. Margins aren't great.",0.6320293,0.477

Cracking spreads are a bit more challenged as we go into this quarter. And so we'll feel a bit of headwind from that. And then we'll - as we slow down the big engines due to decline in specialty business, we're going to have asset utilization headwind that occurs across the two big complexes in Longview and Kingsport and that higher sort of cost per unit with these lower rates will impact CI as well as specialty.",1.1206194,0.18
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,47,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it will feel a bit of that. So you're going to see a meaningful decline with all those factors as we go into sort of Q2 with this business.

On the cost reduction front, you had outlined that you were going to save $20 million to $40 million this year and $100 million over a 3-year period. That's been accelerated to $150 million this year. Can you talk about the buckets that, that falls into?

At some point, you are going to have contractors back on site. You are going to travel, et cetera. So should we be thinking about this $150 million as kind of a 2020 reduction versus your previous plan? And then that will dissipate in 2021 and beyond?",0.6833681,0.433

It's important to keep in mind if demand really doesn't come back much, we can extend these savings. For longer than what we've currently assumed to ride through even a more difficult time. On the flip side, I think we're learning a lot about how we can operate and be efficient in this work-from-home environment and there's different operating modes, so we're embedding that into our thinking about how to improve our long-term cost structure.",0.7579462,0.779
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,59,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we're certainly escalating and accelerating what we intended to do on that $100 million-plus program to get more of that as we go into the back half of this year as well as next year. So there's a lot of actions we're taking to sustain through this second phase of activity, our cost. Key thing I want to emphasize, though, is none of what we're doing is cutting our innovation programs. So we are optimizing for this environment.",1.0468623,0.847

We've even recycled Tritan content - product that we launched. We've already got three wins on that. Nalgene, Camelbak and a couple of other big brands have adopted. We're getting wins on our recycled cellulosics as we speak, two of the largest ophthalmic manufacturers have seen the power of a half bio content, half recycled content product for their offerings, continue to get wins in Tetrashield for can packaging and food where we've got just great chemical resistance and toughness and non-intent BPA.

EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,65,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So yes, let me answer that question. We expected it. And I want to start a little bit just back on the market comment. So the - obviously, demand is unpredictable. That's why we pulled earnings guidance. And we are in the position to sort of understand what happened in April, but not know what's coming for the rest of the year. But we have to make some assumptions, and we are modeling scenarios like everyone else is doing different kinds of recovery out of the second quarter.",0.9820701,0.614

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We do believe the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with the complete shutdown of these global economies and the indication as we see it now, that people will start trying to come back to life through this quarter. I want to emphasize this diversity in markets is a huge help for us to maintain stability. The 40% that's very stable and even 35% that's sort of mixed is providing a lot of stability to offset the challenges that we have in that transportation, textile side. And there's a lot of uncertainty there. We do see price stability.",0.7925835,0.659
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,67,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we saw great price stability in the first quarter. We expect price stability to continue into the second quarter in the specialties. So we are getting some benefits there from raw materials and would expect that to continue through the year. And as I said, low oil is sort of a neutral to positive event for the overall portfolio. So that's all what we know about the markets. In that great uncertainty, what we have to do is focus on what we can control.",1.294621,0.909
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,68,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so what we can control more so is a lot of our cash generation outside of cash earnings. And so we're doing everything we can to stay close to our customers, make sure we don't lose share, keep our innovation going so we - when the markets recover, we will cover with it. We've acted really quickly to idle all of our plants or campaign them or do - fuel utilization. We moved very quickly in March when we saw this was going to get worse outside of China with the COVID spread.",0.9559902,0.077
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,69,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we really sort of ramped back raw material purchase and everything else in the plant so that we could take advantage of what demand does exist to pull inventory down, and we're doing a great job of that. So working capital $250 million, we think will been released. And with all the cost actions really described, $150 million on the cost side and about 40% of that will flow into the second quarter number on that $150 million and reducing CapEx $100 million.

EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,70,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so when we look at that and run our scenarios, obviously, the dividend is our priority. We're going to pay that. It's a great strong dividend. It's been increasing for over a decade. And on the delevering, which is our focus, we do think we can do substantially more. And what that means to us, even in a very slow economic recovery, we believe we can do greater than $1 billion of free cash flow. And obviously, if the recovery is better than that, there's upside.",1.1361043,0.94
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,71,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So when we say substantial, it's substantial that we're going to make a lot of progress in our delevering. But people should not be using that to try and reverse engineer earnings. It's what we're trying to do on cash flow so things - and the levers that we can pull, we can pull even harder in inventory if we need to, we can pull harder on costs if we need to. But it's a cash-centric strategy that we're operating right now.",0.2876936,0.66
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,73,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So I'll take the first part of that question, and I'll let Willie answer the contract question. So spreads in the specialties, we do expect to improve our spreads in Advanced Materials of the raw material tailwinds that we have there. With the two third of AFP as we sort of separate that out for you, we expect spreads to improve with good price stability relative to the raw material declines. And so in all those areas, I think we see that Fibers, very steady spreads for the year. All that is, I think, a place where we can get some additional cash and earnings benefit.",0.1279544,0.933
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,74,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The third of AFP, I'd say, the tires adhesives, it's going to be more stable spreads, but at the challenged levels we had in the back half of last year. We don't see it getting a lot worse this year relative to the second half of 2019, but we don't expect it to get a lot better given the sort of competitive dynamics in that spot. And in Chemical Intermediates, as I said, we've got some challenges there on spreads. Something important to note about this oil topic is our crackers and the spreads there are a little bit different than other companies'.",1.0077425,0.651
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,75,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it's not nearly as challenged at this point as it was in the past. So '10 to 2016, we had a huge tailwind when oil went up and we had stranded gas in the U.S. that let ethane and propylene also be stranded and really cheap. You got to remember, our crackers are propylene centric because that's what we make specialties from. That's why they exist. So we're much more propane-based in our crackers. And we - on top of that, we made the RGP investment to even further reduce the amount of ethylene we produce, replacing some of the NGL feeds with RGP.",0.4458028,0.526
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,76,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that changed the dynamic. So we're now 70% to 75% propane, 20% to 25% ethane, the remainder 5% to 10% is RGP. And propane isn't stranded anymore, right? So it stranded up through about 2016, but they added so much export capacity to export propane. That's now reconnected to the oil market. So propane propylene spreads are a lot more connected than ethylene to ethane. And RGP is very tightly correlated to PGP.",0.4841076,0.202
EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,77,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the volatility still is going to be a challenger, but it's not nearly the challenge that we would have faced back in 2015 and 2016, as an example with its low oil now. So we have some spread. It's more about competitive intensity than it is about cracking spread that's going to sort of pressure some of these margins in this competitive environment.

The thing I want to add beyond just the restructuring activities, and we intend to be aggressive there and hopefully make some decisions here soon about our asset footprint, the innovation is actually very attractive to potential interested parties and actually going quite well.

We're assuming OEM production is going to be down 50% sequentially. So automotive coatings's going to track that and be quite a large headwind. On the other side, architectural coatings seem to be holding up a lot better based on what we're seeing and what I heard the coating customers that we have, say, earlier this week.

And things like Tritan, where we're the only competitor in the world, we've got a lot of control over pricing. On the auto-related markets. Interlayers is annual contracts.

So when we talk about transportation, and in any reference, it's always autos, tires and aviation. So all three are in that comment about being a very challenged market.

Something else I'd note just on the back half of this year. It's important to keep in mind that as we're running our plants and something that Willie said about idling a bunch of facilities or severely reducing their run rates.

So Tritan wins in the marketplace for - historically for two reasons, and now it has a third.

And then with regard to volume in chemical intermediates, Mark, I think you called out four different factors there. One of them was strong volumes in ag.

But it's like the price of oil, the demand is off to such a degree. It's a little hard to figure that out yet here in the second quarter. But we do see PGP holding up relatively well compared to ethylene by a significant amount. And that spread, therefore, to propane is holding up reasonably well. So that's helping.

You've got the sort of competitive dynamics, spread compression part of this as well as reduced volume, which is not normal for that segment. Normally, they can clear all their volume.

But it's relatively stable, too, because we're predominantly primate only North America because that's the only asset we have.

The capacity that we have in place to serve the tow market is sufficient to serve the tow market. It's still not growing, right? So it's a very stable business, and we'll be stable. We expect tow volume to be stable this year. It was stable back in 2009. And but the market is still declining in that 2% to 3% range.

EMN-2020-Q1-2020-05-01,171,Answer,2020-05-01,1,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So the capacity is completely sufficient to serve that market. And it's important that we have enough capacity to serve our customers there because security supply is extremely important to our cigarette customers. So the capacity is repurposed towards textiles we're going to be materially reducing the rates of those facilities to align with the textile demand.

But when people come out of that, I expect some will still buy cars again, and some are going to buy clothing again.

EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,93,Question,2019-07-26,2,2019,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess my question is just - as we exit 2019 and if we assume there's some trade resolution hypothetically for the start of 2020, should we envision a snapback in earnings, sort of 2019 is a throwaway year and 2020 goes back to the trend rate you were on before then? Or should we think about 2019 being a new base off of there will be some level of growth in 2020?",1.6158637,0.811
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,94,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, first of all, I think it's a little hard to predict 2020 at this point. But to answer your question, the challenges that we have predominantly this year, fourth quarter last year as well as this year, are a volume mix based story. And it's important to emphasize the mix part of this too because a lot of the consumer discretionary markets that we sell to are very high value additives.",2.4274654,0.698
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,95,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, if the trade war gets resolved or stimulus in China works despite a neutral trade situation that starts getting the business confidence and China confidence back up that drives China growth back into gear, which also will improve European economy as well in a substantial way, you would get a snapback. You'll get not just volume recovery in primary demand, but restocking associated with people going back to more normal inventory levels compared to where they are now, which is exceptionally low. And it's a mirror image. The earnings on the volume mix side come back the same way they have dropped this year. So, you would get a very good recovery on that front, on the volume mix side. We, obviously, have taken costs out, and so you get the fixed cost leverage that comes with that as well as you go into next year.",2.3382233,0.859
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,96,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On spreads, though, I would assume spreads stay relatively neutral because, in a recovering economy, raws will go up and we'll increase prices to keep up with raws like we did last year. So, it will still be a volume mix story just on the other side.",1.9824776,0.586
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,97,Question,2019-07-26,2,2019,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Okay. And, Curt, if I could just ask you on the cash flow, obviously, very strong performance year-to-date despite the earnings challenges. When you talk about improved working capital performance, should we be thinking that the work you're doing this year is going to lead to sustainably different or better working capital ratios that we can build into next year? Or are these just extraordinary efforts you're making this year given the challenging macro circumstances?",1.4755818,0.905
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,98,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Thanks, Vince. What you see right now is our free cash flow has been kind of running similar to last year. And again, we've got a lot of talented people helping us manage cash flow across the company.",2.2886096,0.893
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,99,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"What I'd say is, on the working capital side, we'll be aggressive. Normally, we'd see working capital relief second half of the year. In addition, you're getting some benefit to the flow-through of low raw material value. So, that's helping. And then, we are taking some additional steps to address our working capital across different fronts, multiple fronts, quite honestly. And so, yes, I would expect that to improve some of our working capital statistics. And I would say that's not an improvement this year. I think it's a multiyear effort as well that will help contribute to, again, a wonderful free cash flow story with our business. Which, following up on Mark's other question, we'd also expect our free cash flow to improve in that kind of environment as well. And so, I love the free cash flow of this company that reflects the quality of our businesses. And that free cash flow is coming to you [indiscernible] at a free cash flow yield approaching 10%.",1.2910418,0.993
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,100,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I would just add on that, on Curt's comment on the 2020. Not only do you get the earnings back when the demand recovers and the cash comes with it, you also pull inventory down in that environment. So, it can be quite strong.",2.6674817,0.648
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,104,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Jeff. The principal driver of the drop in revenue in the US is pricing in Chemical Intermediates. You have to remember that, unlike many other companies out there, the predominance of our Chemical Intermediates business is located in North America. And so, the vast majority of the revenue and the price decline is reflected there. The good news is we also don't face the - much more competitive dynamics in Asia or Europe for those kind of products where the prices are even much lower than where we are today. So, that's part of the story. And then, demand just a bit off with some destocking and careful behavior, as well as things like the wet weather in ag that's driven that revenue down with the planting season being curtailed.",2.1118768,0.839
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,106,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The outlook was for the first half to be challenged on volume relative to the second half. So, that was our outlook. This is playing out as we expected. It's really about timing of orders in two fronts, Jeff. So, on the customer buying patterns of the big multinationals, 2018 first half was just exceptionally high relative to second half of last year. There just tends to be chunkiness in how they order and that's what was the pattern last year. Amnd then, on top of that, you had some trade-related issues as well that drove some prebuy in Q2, not in China, but in some other countries worried about trade that pre-bought around trade uncertainty. And then, you had, of course, good orders in China in the first half of the year for tow imports that dropped pretty significantly as we went into the second half. So, it's all a timing issue. So, what you'll see is we had these two - the first half drop and then the second half will be some improvement over last year.",2.0704971,0.775
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,110,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I was guessing that question might come this morning. No, I'm not concerned about this specialty nature of this business. Let's just start off with the fact that, in Q2, which was, obviously, a challenging quarter for us, we had 25% EBITDA margins, which I think demonstrate very high-quality earnings. But much more importantly, you've got to decompose into its components to really understand what's going on.",1.0729421,0.248
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,111,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, first of all, the price side of the equation, which I think is the bigger test than the volume question, around the specialty nature of business, I think we're actually doing quite well on managing price here. So, when you look at a price decline of 3%, half of that, as we told you, is cost pass-through contracts, predominantly in care chemicals and a few other products. So, the spreads are absolutely stable and we're driving good volume growth in those product areas. But there is so much volatility on the raws on those those specific products. We neutralize that volatility with the CPG.",2.3818256,0.912
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,112,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other half is competitive pressure. So, we're talking about a 1.5% decline here year-over-year due to some competitive factors. And in that, there is really sort of three stories, but the underlying story is the same at a high level in all three. So, you've got some pressure. And insoluble sulfur in tires, you have some pressure in adhesive resins and a few animal nutrition products.",2.2171964,-0.671
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,113,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if you look at the last decade, we've always had tremendous growth in China leading the world in growth. And as you look at these product areas, we're running out of capacity in all of them because demand was so strong globally that we added capacity to serve growth in these areas and our competitors did too. So, you certainly have this capacity being added in the last year to support growth as the markets were tight. At the same time, for the first time in the last decade, we've had a big drop in demand in China. So, you have a competitive situation.",2.2823961,0.945
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,114,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the good news about all three of those things is there's strong underlying growth. There's a long-term belief that China is going to grow as a market beyond what's going on here in the short term. And importantly, and key to our strategy, unlike our competitors in these specific areas, is that we have innovation strategies to extend and add more differentiation and growth to these businesses.",2.302771,0.943
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,115,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, in all three, we've launched a new Crystex Cure Pro product that demonstrates far superior mixing efficiency to our competitors. Product trials going on everywhere, getting orders, but it's early. Same thing in adhesives. Very strong underlying market growth in hygiene and other products that will absorb the capacity over time, [indiscernible] packaging, tapes, labels right now, creating some demand space. But, more importantly, we're adding a new no odor, no volatile organic product that is a significant differentiator. There's very high demand. It'll be online by the end of this year. Same thing on animal nutrition. We're moving from just selling to organic acids into formulated products and have tremendous growth there.",2.1719641,0.945
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,116,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, well, the timing is not great. If this had happened - this trade war had happened two years from now into the future, it would look more like AM. These products would all be in market, having a lot more traction, helping offset some of the underlying demand problem.",1.8814181,-0.576
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,117,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, net, spreads are flat. We don't have spread compression in this segment. But some of the raw material tailwind has been offset by some of these prices. The key here is the volume mix story. And as Curt mentioned, the volume parts, the unit volumes that are coming off, principally because of demand, and then you've got the mix story with cellulosic additives and few other high margin additives. So, it's a volume mix story. So, negative fixed cost leverage that comes with that. And that's the entirety of the margin percent story. So, we don't think this is commoditizing.",2.1377343,-0.67
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,119,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah. What I'd say, just in general, on shutdown costs as a whole, they're only modestly higher year-over-year, but the trend of the shutdown costs are different. Over the last couple of years, we've had the higher shutdown costs in second quarter and fourth quarter. This year, it's more going to be in third quarter and fourth quarter. So, that sequential year-over-year impact on third quarter is going to be just over $30 million higher shutdown costs third quarter of this year compared to third quarter of last year. Now, what that means is you won't have - last couple of years, you had had more headwind from third quarter going into fourth quarter, but this year the shutdown costs will be roughly the same third quarter and fourth quarter.",1.773409,0.153
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,123,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, on the demand side, this actually predates the Trump initiated China-US trade dispute. There was a number of anti-dumping duties put in place by Europe and the US on truck tires that dramatically constrained where the Chinese tire producers could sell their products, backing up a lot of that production into China. Helped the multinationals and we've benefited from that in North America and Europe. But, obviously, China is a huge tire production market and that got very competitive when those companies didn't have any market access.",1.399348,-0.044
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,124,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the market has been growing really fast. So, not only did tire companies add a lot of capacity to support this growth that they were expecting that did not materialize, we have some competitors who are also adding capacity to sort of serve that growth. So, that really is the story on the demand side. And, overall, market is obviously down. The truck tire market is off with lower commercial activity, the OEM production market is off. But it's important remember that 75% of tires are replacement as opposed to new production. But it's still connected to commercial activity. And we're highly levered to commercial activity. And our product that we sell, our largest product, insoluble sulfur, so when that comes off, you're going to feel that demand hit.",1.9885901,0.791
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,125,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the price side, I think prices have come off due to the competitive dynamics we've described. It appears to stabilize in the second quarter. From what we can see, demand is going to improve as we work through this destocking as we go into the back half of the year.",1.9348003,0.637
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,127,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I can't speak to the industry. I would say what you have across many of our businesses, whether it's amines or others, we've kind of got our production planning for an improvement for the second half of the year versus the first. And so, now, we're just adjusting operating rates where some areas weren't as strong including amines, where you didn't have that seasonal improvement in demand as much as we had hoped given the weather. But we're managing our inventory and operations as we adjust to demand as we do across all our portfolio.",0.409128,0.9

First question just around the cost cutting program, you had the net $40 million in kind of before things got worse than you expected. Should we expect another major program in the back half of the year or early next year if these conditions continue?",1.5123139,0.25
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,131,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, as we look at our cost structure, obviously, we saw some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment back in April and we took additional actions to cut costs. $40 million is on top of the $80 million to offset inflation is a pretty aggressive program. We don't think there's another step of additional costs that we're going to take in this current economic environment. That's substantial. We're obviously going to manage costs aggressively wherever we can. But we have a tremendous amount of growth we have in innovation. We have tremendous engagement in customers that we have to serve. We have to maintain and run our plants reliably in this environment. And I think we're getting to that point. And we're one of the lowest cost investigative R&D as a percentage of sales in the industry for the kind of innovation we are doing. We're in the bottom quartile. So, I think we've always run our company very efficiently.",1.9740576,0.862

EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,133,Question,2019-07-26,2,2019,Duffy Fischer,Barclays,"Thank you. And then, just on your commentary that Q3 looks like Q2, so right at $2 a share, and then to get to the midpoint of your annual guidance, that would be about $2 a share then in the fourth quarter, which is up almost 45% year-on-year. Can you either walk from Q3 into Q4, how you keep things flat; or Q4 over Q4, how you would improve it 40%? Why does fourth quarter look so much different than it has historically?",1.6821306,0.892
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,134,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. It first starts with why is Q3 so different. And then I think it's easier to talk about Q4. So, in Q3, we do expect improvement to be sequentially strong from Q2 to Q3, but it's been offset due to the higher shutdown schedule. Normally, high shutdowns in Q2 and Q4. This year is just different where we have a large cracker that we're taking down and a bunch of other shutdowns that we're doing in Q3. So, you've got this headwind from Q2 to Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, as Curt noted, about $30 million difference versus last year in Q3 due to that shutdown schedule.",0.6748166,0.686
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,135,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, we're taking overall costs down just to be clear. It's a timing issue about when costs show up and you have these period of costs with the shutdown in Q3. So, as you go to Q4, you would normally have this headwind. It was roughly $30 million last year from Q3 to Q4 that knocks earnings down sequentially Q3 to Q4. You're not going to have that this year, so that's part of the explanation. You don't have that headwind.",1.9751426,0.382
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,136,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Second, Q4, I think is not going to be your typical Q4. You've got innovation, market development that's continuing to drive growth and create growth, which is great, that will help have volume be better. You have companies that are already destocked to some degree. There still be volume lower in Q4 versus Q3 due to seasonal patterns, but probably not as much destocking as normal.",2.6674817,0.827
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,137,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You've got costs flowing through on raw materials. And because volume hasn't been as strong, taking longer for that to flow through, but it will certainly start showing up in Q4 as we look at it, as well as the manufacturing cost reductions flowing through. And we're a LIFO accounting shop, to keep in mind. So, you had all these dynamics playing on that allowed Q4 to be quite good.",2.5786471,0.944
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,138,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if you're comparing it specifically to last year, you've got to remember that, last year, it was a really easy comp. It was extremely - not only did you have the $30 million headwind and shutdowns from Q3 to Q4 last year, you had dramatic reduction in plant rates to adjust to the destocking and volume drops last year and high cost raws flowing through last year versus this year of low cost raws flowing through. So, all that combines together to give us confidence about how we're guiding.",1.7575387,0.659

EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,143,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, you can see, at our Innovation Day, we talked about a growing EBITDA margin. We're probably a couple percentage points below that. Part of that's going to be that volume mix because we're not getting all these specialty business sales that we premised back at our Innovation Day. And that's just because of the macroeconomic environment. So, I still believe we can get back to those margins that we talked about at our Innovation Day across our portfolio. Part of that is again getting those specialty sales back to where we think they're going to be, and that was to one of the earlier comments today, getting back to what a more robust economy would support.",1.9631131,0.932

We have room to grow into those and then just - we have an environment where it's kind of sluggish.

EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,145,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I just want to add. Mix is an incredibly powerful tool in the center and heart of our strategy. So, as we're growing high margin products through innovation, above segment and company average in AM and AFP, you just get a powerful lift in your margin. And you see that in how AM recovered from Q1 to Q2 and how it's going to deliver earnings growth for the full year. But, unfortunately, if you have a demand contraction like AFP has right now, you're going to feel that mix hit. And, really, in Q2, it was really substantial. The cellulose additives that we sell and a few of these other additives that go into automotive market are very high value, and so we really felt that mix hit to this year and last year - Curt mentioned there was a tough comp. Last year wasn't just demand that was good. We also had some prebuys associated with sort of trade fear in China and some restocking with the coal gas event in Q2. So, it was really tough comp for that specific area inside AFP versus last year.",2.0696822,0.917
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,147,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think 2019 is the year where things are bottoming out. It's really hard to call the quarter on it, but prices have stabilized. The demand situation is great in hygiene, which continues to drive growth and absorb capacity. But a few of the other markets that are more packaging, tapes, labels, things like that, is obviously more caught up in the macro environment and demand is off, which will obviously, I think, stabilize and get better as we move forward. So, I think it's playing out this year.",2.1377343,0.951

Directly in resins, we have this low volatile product that has been verified by our customers to be the best in the market. We're getting all the trials going on now. Pl;ants being modified to be able to make it. The good news is it's just a modification of existing asset. We don't have to build a new plant.

So, we make some amorphous polyolefins for this market, having great growth. Not a new area for us that we haven't been in and we're really getting a lot of adoption on some new products there that dramatically improve the hot-melt adhesives for hygiene and some other applications.

EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,155,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the example I think would be adhesives where you see some of that capacity in Asia getting placed in Europe that was intended to support growth in China. So, that would be an example. Animal nutrition will be the other example where you have a bunch of capacity that was added in China to serve animal nutrition. And then, with the swine population being decimated in China, people are looking for another home for that. None of these actually create long-term concern for us, PJ, because obviously the Chinese have to eat, and so they're going to grow more pigs and absorb that capacity again. And same thing is true about hygiene growth and everything else. Adhesives, as that demand recovers, it'll start absorbing it back into China.",1.9710676,0.883
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,156,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, that applies to the rest of the story. We've just never been through - the industry has never been through a story where China is the problem. They've been the source of growth to absorb capacity being added in Asia as well as other markets, and now they're not, so that just creates a different dynamic.",1.9678077,0.715
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,158,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yeah. Thanks for the question. No, we're excited about again the bolt-ons we've completed so far this year. Good businesses. Great people. Nice synergies. All the things we look for in acquisitions. We continue to have an active pipeline. I won't say our activity is increasing because multiple is coming down because we've always been a disciplined party. Maybe it's a contributing factor. We're able to get deals done more. But the businesses we've been talking to have had reasonable valuation expectations. And so, to the extent the market is more conducive to reasonable multiples, we'll continue to increase our activity. When I think about the rest of this year, just to kind of level set that, we're continuing to be active. I've mentioned some amount of acquisitions we can do, roughly $100 million this year. It's possible. But, right now, we have nothing imminent in our portfolio on acquisitions, but we're still actively working our pipeline and we'll continue to be disciplined as you've seen over the years with our acquisition strategy.",2.1049858,0.935
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,162,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Frank. Yes, it's obviously been a pretty dynamic time and predicting demand and orders has been tricky for a while now. In the second quarter, we were on track up through the first week of June with demand, the trends that we saw that we thought were in the range that we gave you in April. And then, in the last two weeks of June, we just saw a dramatic slowdown relative to what should have been a normal order pattern in June leading up to the G20 meeting.",2.0533822,0.802
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,163,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, from what I can figure out, people got very nervous about what's going to happen in that meeting and they all decided to start managing inventory down and reducing their orders given that risk. And we actually saw the exact same thing in the last two weeks of February, headed up to the March 1 deadline when people were worried about the US tariff.",1.9339853,-0.69
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,164,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think there is this sort of push pull kind of thing around economic uncertainty that's driving some behavior. And so, that was part of it. There's no question that we saw - there was more risk on the table after the May escalation in the trade war. And that risk, as you got through G20, got confirmed that there was no end in sight about this trade war, and now at a higher level of tariffs and more disagreement than less, certainly from where we saw the world in April on how this was going to get settled.",2.4013855,-0.959
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,165,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, as you as you look to that, we had to step back and revise our macroeconomic assumptions. I think everyone in April thought, and through the beginning of May at least, that the economy was going to get better in the back half of the year, trade war was going to sort of settle, certainly not escalate. And now we're in just a very different world. I don't think that's true and I think many of our peers and other people and the macro data support that. There's not a lot of signs of economic recovery coming in the second half. So, we had to revise our assumption down on that.",2.1283619,0.682
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,166,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And it's not just about China. When you think about that, Europe is highly dependent on trade to China and there's other factors, obviously, going on in Europe. So, that economy has slowed down. That's led to a lot of destocking and expectation of lower demand, automotive and other consumer discretionary markets taking the primary hit as people are cautious.",2.0354523,-0.477
EMN-2019-Q2-2019-07-26,167,Answer,2019-07-26,2,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Reality is, if you look at the last three quarters, you can say we're in an industrial recession now. Industrial production is down. Even in AFP, as I look at the demand story there, third of it's mix and the other part being unit volume. We're not really losing much share. Maybe 1% of that 8% is about share loss in these competitive stories I was just telling. Demand is down even in AFP. If you look at all of our peers who are industrial exposed, we're in a negative demand situation. So, that's the kind of environment we now have to adjust to. We thought it would stabilize and get better and we've revised our assumption.",2.2542787,-0.171

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, obviously, if the economy gets better, so will our results, but that's what we're operating under and then you've got some additional things like this ag and animal nutrition story as well. So, that's really sort of what drove our reduction, combined with spreads being a little more challenged in CI than we had expected that we'd expect to sort of continue at this level going forward.

One of those is also debt repaydown, that $215 million to $300 million level. Share repurchases will be pretty disciplined.

So, as you know, since 2014 and now, there's been a dramatic drop in the amount of imports into China. And we do have a JV in China. It's running full and making good profits, to the story of the demand you're talking about. But total imports into China now are just incredibly low in total compared to where we were.

We're not seeing that benefit in the last three quarters because the CNTC chose not to buy from plants in the US.

Our current guidance assumes, as Curt indicated, that there's going to be some modest improvement in demand, principally because destocking is not occurring anymore as a way specialties can grow. Obviously, we'll not be selling a bunch of chemical intermediate products that we're just not producing because of the large shutdown. And that's the corporate volume down to being more modest. So, that's embedded in our guidance and what we expect. And that's really by far the largest driver in the change of our guidance from April to now, is this revision on a volume mix expectation going forward combined with bit lower spreads in CI and this currency headwind.",2.6792991,0.459

In Chemical Intermediates, you have to get markets to get really tight again for those spreads to come back because not only is demand off, but supply has been out in a lot of those kind of products. So, I feel really good about how specialty is going to recover. And I feel good about that 70% of our earnings where Chemical Intermediates has now been reduced to a much smaller percentage of our portfolio. And I'm also proud of the actions we've taken to mitigate some of that volatility with the RGP investment.

As I mentioned, the innovation platforms are really exciting in AFP, but just at an earlier stage and that's why you see the difference between AM and AFP on sort of the demand story. But we'll get there over the next couple years. And we are assuming destocking is playing its way out. I think it's a key macroeconomic assumption we're making.

One again, what you already mentioned, the flow through of lower raw materials. Also, keep in mind, the fourth quarter last year was a pretty down year for that segment just because of the amount of destocking that occurred in the fourth quarter.

They've been working things down pretty aggressively, given the level of uncertainty that we face. And there's a limit. Once you get inventories really low, you can't go any further than that unless there's a fundamental step down in demand. So, I think we have customers already living sort of at very short order patterns and very tight inventory management.",2.0138549,-0.176

Before I turn it over to questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments. The first half of 2020 has been unprecedented given the serious threat to health and safety.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"While COVID-19 has caused us to shift some priorities this year, we are renewing our commitment to drive a more inclusive and diverse workforce, which is a core value of Eastman and critical to our growth strategy and ability to innovate. During the quarter, we took steps to strengthen our efforts to build more inclusive teams by increasing our efforts to mitigate the impact of unconscious bias and expanding resources to equip employees for their role in driving a more inclusive culture. We're making progress and have much more work to do to ensure every team can show up and contribute fully at work and in their communities.",2.3598207,0.944

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As we look at our first half performance, we believe that we have performed relatively well with our focus on free cash flow. Sales revenue for the quarter and for the first half of the year when compared to peer results demonstrated resilience, which is a function of our innovation-driven growth model as well as the diversity of our end markets and a testament to the great work of Eastman employees as they navigate this challenging and unprecedented environment. We also made great progress in our $150 million of cost tractions in the quarter and are on track to hit our full year target. With our focus on free cash flow, we'd also manage our inventory aggressively to respond to the fall in demand and go beyond that, to generate even more cash delivering our best free cash flow for the first half.",0.9555827,0.983
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,11,Remarks,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Turning now to our expectations for 2020. In the second quarter, the cost from the lower capacity utilization was $120 million sequentially. We expect this will decline by about half in the third quarter and be partially offset by increasing maintenance spending and a moderation of the impact from cost reduction actions as we ramp back up. Advanced Materials will have the biggest impact from the improvement in capacity utilization, between $30 million and $35 million for the quarter. AFP will see some benefit and CI will face a net headwind as higher maintenance shutdowns will be more than the utilization tailwind.",1.406683,0.7

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The third quarter is off to a strong start as we benefit from volume recovery and start to realize the benefits of inventory management actions we took in the second quarter. As a result, we expect a substantial sequential increase in earnings. Most importantly, we are maintaining our focus on cash generation, which is our priority for the year. Early on, a very strong start in the first half of the year, we are on track to generate over $1 billion of free cash flow for the year. Given the continued uncertainty related to COVID-19, we are not providing 2020 guidance.",0.0778321,0.957

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"While, the actions we're taking today are making a significant difference, we remain focused on innovation strategy and are continuing to invest in our growth and our commercial capabilities. At the same time, we will be driving an operational transformation program to structure remove cost by greater than $200 million by the end of 2022 with a significant impact in '21. Altogether, these actions we've taken in 2020 are well -- we are well positioned to benefit from the return of economic growth as we look at the future in '21 and beyond.

EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,19,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Great set of questions and one of the most exciting growth platforms, we have at Eastman that we've been working on for the last, I guess 18 months now. As all of you know, attention to carbon footprints, switch our economy, the plastic waste problem we have, in landfills, the ocean is a critical issue that we as an industry need to solve, and it's also just a huge waste of carbon letting that all go into the environment as opposed to recycling. And what's exciting about Eastman is, we are a leading I think with commercial scale investments to close that loop and create a circular economy that is both economic and great for the environment.",2.208639,0.943
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,20,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So one of those two technologies as you noted is a carbon renewal technology where we're repurposing our gasifier to reforming waste plastic and so we take it on the front end instead of the call, and we can completely clean up that waste plastic to its molecular elements and rebuild asset yields and cellulosic products. So we went commercial on that quite some time ago and are scaling up for their customers both in textiles with our new NAYO products that have already 50% bio content from sustainably grown for us. Now, the other half will be based on recycled plastic; so it's --and these products are biodegradable as microfibers in the ocean. So it's the hat-trick of all offers in textiles when you have bio, half recycled content and you don't have to worry about the microfibers. So we get -- we have tremendous interest in a number of customers who are adopting this. One of the biggest wins we've had, recent lease with H&M who have put that in their conscious collection and we're seeing a number of other companies adopt. Obviously in the COVID environment, where the textile market is severely down, it's hard to see a lot of that benefit, but we can still see it in women's wear, which is our target growth market, where we're only down about 15% when the underlying market is down 30%. So we're seeing good substitution growth even in a very challenged market where people are still adopting sustainable solutions at a premium compared to other alternatives in the marketplace. So we're getting both a price premium as well as accelerated growth. And we would expect as the textile market recovers that would accelerate.",0.1841891,0.963
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,21,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Same is true with the variety of cellulosic plastic offerings we have on the especially plastics side. Ophthalmics, we've had a number of customers now adopt to recycle their cellulosic waste for sunglasses, eyeglasses, we're the dominant player in that marketplace with a very strong leadership position and we're going to be taking back their product actually and circulating it back into a true circular solution for sunglasses and eyeglasses. So we've had a number of wins there, and that's only one of two technologies. The other one is our polyester technology where we can recycle polyester and then zip it bit back into it's intermediates and then return that back to market. What's great about both of these apologies, is that they are truly circular where we can close the loop into the same level of application or even a better application. We're not down-cycling products which is what happens to a lot of waste.",0.1564792,0.967
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,22,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And what's great about molecular recycling is, the product is identical, so there is no -- no-trade offs and performance. The performance is identical to the fossil fuel based product. The quality is identical. There are no safety concerns, because we're breaking it down to the molecular and cleaning it all up before we make the new polymer. And it's infinite, like aluminum, so we can continue to recycle the product, forever. There is no limitations. Mechanical recycling starts to break down over time. So there is only so many times you can do that. So, it truly is the solution and we believe that as we've said, there is $200 million to $300 million at least of incremental revenue associated with this in both share gains and price premiums that we can get from the marketplace, provides a very attractive return on investment.",1.6340668,0.936
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,30,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And as you think about the trade war question, sometimes we forget, we're interested in phase 2, we started with the trade war in '19, and a pandemic just to make it more interesting this year on top of it. And we're already living with a certain amount of trade war that didn't exactly get completely abated, you've got stabilized, I would say in the beginning of this year, but it didn't go away. So we're -- that's still there. And I think we've done a good job of managing our way through it, last year, and we certainly we're seeing strong improvement in our results, once it's stabilized in the January, February, part of this year. But we have a diversity of end markets, we've shown we can be stable with our end markets as well as our regions. There is a lot of upside in North America and Europe, and a pandemic recovery in front of us. That would certainly mitigate some risk to China as we sort of move forward. So I think we've got a good diverse position on not just geographies, but in markets and have already demonstrated, we can manage our way through a trade war.",1.6682967,0.95
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,33,Question,2020-08-04,2,2020,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,Yes. Good morning. Can you speak to the inventory reductions in the second quarter as well as where you ended the quarter and what that might mean for your operating rates moving forward?,1.0146228,0.772
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,35,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. The other thing I'd note is, as you think about utilization, the upside of utilization headwind this year is in 2021, so we've generated a lot of cash this year really proud of how much progress we've made, incredible actions by our teams and how well they did it. And it wasn't just following demand, right, we went way beyond that, and pulling inventory down to generate cash, which created a good portion of that headwind, so as we said $140 million year-over-year headwind and utilization in the second quarter, half of that was doing that inventory management beyond just following demand. So if you look at next year, if you just assume volumes next year, equal to this year that half of that $140 million is the earnings tailwind next year relative to this year. So not only are we holding costs flat with our structural actions into next year on the fixed costs. This utilization set of actions we took in the second quarter and to some degree continuing in the third quarter will create a pretty substantial earnings tailwind for next year as long as volumes are equal to this year and then once volumes get better than that, obviously, you get even more tailwind, because the incremental margins become quite significant for all the volume and mix growth beyond that.",0.1552567,0.977
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,36,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I think the utilization really sets us. It was great for cash this year, is our priority. We've been very clear. That's our priority as opposed to worrying about how the earnings look from an accounting point of view, especially with the period charges in the first -- in the second quarter, but really sets us up for recovery next year.",0.294621,0.306
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,37,Question,2020-08-04,2,2020,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"I see. Thank you for that. And then secondly I wanted to ask you to elaborate on restructuring. It looks like, do you foresee $200 million or more savings to the end of '22, fairly large number there. Where will that be coming from in terms of your businesses and regions perhaps you could talk about how much is headcount versus asset rationalization and other sources of savings.",1.1475573,0.778
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,40,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. There's quite about quite of a bit of value around network optimization and we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years as you guys know, building up our specialty portfolio. So as you look at those plants, warehouses, networks of how we do everything, there is opportunities to optimize all of that. And there is headcount reduction as well. So as we optimize our business operating model and our investments about making us more effective and nimble agile in our commercial operations, all the way through how we improve our effectiveness of operations especially lot of lessons learned here in the last four months, we see real opportunity to sort of streamline the organization and take costs out there.",0.0631622,0.977
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,41,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So there's a lot of different levers of it. It's all line of sight. There is very detailed programs to that total number, Kevin, and how we get there. It's no one silver bullet, but a lot of heavy lifting by people across the entire organization to make it happen. But it's a great year to sort of step back and say, how do we complete the transformation to a specialty company, both on the commercial capability and innovation investments which we're continuing to do, but also on how we become very cost competitive to create value for our shareholders and stay competitive against the people we face in the marketplace. So a lot of great work there. But very clear --clear set of action plans.",0.200489,0.983
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,42,Question,2020-08-04,2,2020,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,All right. Thank you very much.,2.631439,0.361
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,45,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think the answers are a little bit different between AM and AFP, so I'm going to sort of give it to you on both fronts. So in Advanced Materials, the supply chain there is very short, so we feel the changes in OEM behavior production or sales level, when it comes to Performance Films business, because that's at the point of sale as opposed to production pretty quickly. So that's why you saw Advanced Materials, take the bigger impact from COVID in the first quarter where the earnings were nearly as good as the recovery of earnings, you saw sequentially from 4Q to 1Q in AFP.",2.697229,0.589
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,46,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we felt it quickly. We acted quickly and that's also why you saw us take down a lot more operating facilities in Advanced Materials, and that demand came off in March through April, May, and we have more standalone facilities was easier to shut those facilities down in AM, so very quick impact. And we already saw a very quick recovery in those businesses as we got to June. And hence the much stronger forecast for earnings recovery and utilization benefit for Advanced Materials in the third quarter. So, that played out much faster than what we're seeing in advance, I mean as the Functional Products where supply chain is much longer. So we didn't feel the impact really in the first quarter, hence in the stronger earnings performance and stronger as a result bigger sequential drop when it finally caught up to us in the second quarter in AFP.",0.2343113,0.94
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,47,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Coatings just -- was a longer supply chain, same with aviation and so we felt that. And through the second quarter and it's not going to come back quite as fast in the third quarter on the AFP side. I would also note, there is couple of other differences, one aviation is obviously not coming us back as fast, when it comes to transportation, as we call it and about half our automotive coatings is refinished as opposed to OEM. So AFP also doesn't see that sort of snap back and OEM production as much as, because the refinish obviously is based on our customers' comments, you're going to take a little longer to recover. We do see traffic improving and we expect to get solid recovery there, but it's not going to be as fast.",1.3671557,0.296
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,49,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think that, as you look at A&FP and earnings, first of all we're not going to be giving forecast out to 2023. So, but what I can say is that, it's a great business and the vast majority of the impact of this business has faced since 2018, which is where I think about where earnings were in a stable environment, before the trade war started compounded by a pandemic, the vast majority of our hit between now and then was volume mix, right, less auto demand, B&C demand a variety of different places where we realize some impact on demand. And all of that demand will come back with the market and you got to remember that. Mix is a huge part of the story in both AM and AFP. So when that volume dropped in those in transportation or B&C or -- in consumer durables. That's the highest margins we have relative, company average. So big impact on the way down last year this year and big impact on the mirror image of it recovering. It's not just about volume recovery, that mix is a huge impact in driving value and earnings and cash. So we expect that all to come back.",0.5150774,0.901
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,50,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other party, of course, is we're taking aggressive action on the cost side. Right. So, if we take $150 million out this year, make that structural into '21 and even add on another $100 million. That means we've taken out $150 million relative to 2018, '19, that offset some of the spread and competitive pressure, more than offset the spread and competitive pressure that we've seen in tires and adhesives. So there's no reason for the -- for the earnings not to be able to come back for the Company to a pretty substantial level and get back when volumes come back, we should get back to earnings being better than '19 or '18 when the volumes get back to that level.",0.0387123,0.673
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,52,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's only about the mix part, a lot of the margin comes back.",0.49837,0.0
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,54,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With that mix, not just the volume that's -- we try to be very clear about that back to Innovation Day in 2018 to give you guys some sense of the significance of mix. And it's a big part of our story and growth of course it can see other way when you have demand to come off.",1.303586,0.827
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,58,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Duffy, as we think about this year, there is an additional $100 million which will take out and I'll say, let's think about roughly half of that being more discretionary and half of that being structural as we make momentum on the structural aspects here in the second half. As we pivot into the next year, I think, I highlighted earlier that we're making decisions and taking actions this year that will build roughly $50 million more structural as we look at our asset footprint. And I'll build that connection to what Mark highlighted and we expect network optimization to be a major driver of structural changes also in 2021. So that was basically in that sense keep you cost neutral year-over-year as the discretionary goes away and we replace it with structural. Then on top of that, we see a pathway to an additional $50 million to $100 million and '21 and '22 to grow them the additional increases and deliver to the bottom line.",0.3549307,0.71
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,63,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Slide 2 -- we're seeing a good build and volume, right. So we saw 8% increase in July and June compounded by another 4% in July, order book, so far, it's early August. But the orders being similar to July and August is good compared to the normal seasonal decline you see in August with Europe shutdowns and everything else. So far off to good start, but as we know painfully well, it's a very unpredictable year, we will have to see how economies are impacted by the resurgence. And if there's things we don't see coming that mitigate demand.",0.294621,0.202
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,66,Question,2020-08-04,2,2020,Frank Mitsch,Wells Fargo,"If I could follow-up on that. Really appreciate slide 5, it gives us a good confidence level in terms of the snap back in most impacted, in the mixed impacted businesses, the resilient business looks like it is down 10% year-over-year in July. In the text, you suggested a moderation in that area as consumers go back to a new normal. Can you elaborate on that? And perhaps offer thoughts on when that moderation may be over and what you're seeing, what your order books are seeing in August?",0.3409882,0.901
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,67,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Frank, and thanks for the question. As far as the resilient markets go, obviously some of those markets had a real benefit from the people stocking up for COVID from grocery stores and things like that or care chemicals, same type of product. So packaging care chemicals did well. And there were some people buying some product ahead of time, because they're worried about security of supply and want to make sure that enough inventory they had to run their operations. So you saw a little bit of that going on in some of these resilient markets. The -- and really what we see is demand coming off in some of those cases to what we call more normal than sort of that additional buying. So that's part of the story and some of those sort of packaging consumer markets that we all talk about and read about. You also just remember, there is a seasonal trend down in volume from 2Q to 3Q in some markets like ag, right? So some of this volume is coming off because those markets just naturally seasonally come off sequentially from 2Q to 3Q.",0.8129584,0.968
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,68,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So you got those dynamics going on. I wouldn't say there's anything more dramatic than that. The only other place, I can think of is, in medical, we had very high value product in Advanced Materials where people were buying to make sure that inventory then elective surgeries obviously didn't play out as well; so some of the demand of those products wasn't as great as they expected. And so there is some of that destocking going on, but I think the -- from a timing point of view, frank it's this months, July-August is where people are sort of adjusting their inventories. I don't think it extends through the rest of the year as far as some of that volume adjustment goes and we just sort of level back out to more normal these end markets. But we're not, we're not seeing a steady decline for a long period of time.",0.7783211,0.778

And one of the -- one of the key focuses of the quote new better Eastman is innovation and I -- these are obviously not normal times. But what might be helpful, when people talk about innovation is providing some metrics around that, in terms of the pace of progress, and that you're making in that regard. Is there any -- is there any way that you can provide some quantification on the -- on the innovation front.",1.1464857,0.956
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,70,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think that the key metric we've been using with you in the past is one will continue to use in the future. Just not as useful at the moment. And that's the amount of new business revenue we close from innovation products, right. So, we have a very detailed tracking system with our digital tools on every business we win, whether it was innovation related or just good market segmentation strategy or just transactional, as well as you know why we lose every bit of business and what we can do about it. And so on, we've been driving towards $500 million number this year on new business from innovation and we are well on track to hit it even with the trade war last year where we delivered a very good number. But obviously, this year we're not going to get to that $500 million number when everyone has been sheltered in place for a good period of time.",1.7811736,0.948

We've had a number of wins in the circular economy looks like H&M, as I mentioned earlier with the story, we told the prepared remarks around Tritan Renew in the hydration area with Nalgene coming back and a bunch of other brands that are coming on board with that, recycled content offer that is so important to that customer segment that buys those kind of hydration vessels.",0.7318663,0.945

There is activity in every place where people are still working their innovation agendas, which is the only way you grow out of this and create your own growth. But we're not going to have -- we're not going to get to the $500 million in this context, but I do expect with the activity we're seeing that will snap to it pretty quickly once we get into recovery mode and people can meet us interacting with each other, physically.",0.1275469,0.952
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,76,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So when I look at the fluids business, Jeff. I'd say it's about half and half and clearly, the aviation side of the portfolio which is very high margin business is down dramatically consistent with the milestone of airplanes. We are very sort of milestone driven with that business. And so it's going to recover slowly, when it comes to the other side, I want to highlight, the heat transfer fluids business is actually doing great and actually going to deliver growth this year over last year. So one of the bright spots in the two-thirds of AFP in addition to care chemicals and pharma and packaging and even residential architectural businesses. We got a lot of growth going on in a number of those businesses. That's held in fairly well.",1.1181744,0.969
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,84,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Good morning, Dave. So, the raw material trends, as you think about it, obviously have come off in first quarter and second quarter. And it's actually helpful to think about raw material trends, you know, are back to the third quarter of 2018, right? So, you know, with the trade war, we saw, you know, the price of our petrochemical derivatives that we're buying, for example, come off a lot last year faster than oil did. So, even though oil came off a lot this year, many of the derivatives of oil had already come off pretty substantially. A big part of the raw material trend from all of this, you know, happened last year as opposed to this year. But we certainly have seen some benefits in raw materials, you know, in the first half of this year as we look to the second half of the year, you know, as some raws , I think, are expected to stay relatively flat or moderated, if you look at like paraxylene . But then you've got other places like you saw already in the second quarter where propane, you know, moved up pretty dramatically and PGP didn't. So, you've got things moving around a lot of different directions. We're now expecting a huge raw material headwind as we look at the back half of the year. Our forecasting and plans assume that there's going to be some increase in some of those raw material costs. But we have a bunch of, you know, plans in place and like in chemical intermediates, we're moving prices up already consistent with the raw material environment to stay on track. But we think we're in good shape as far as spreads go when it comes to the back half of the year.",0.3484108,0.979
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,86,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, David, for the question. Obviously, first and foremost, we are focused on our strong and solid dividend being the first priority. Also, as we've highlighted, you know, expecting to pay back greater than $600 million of our net debt down almost $200 million in the first half. We would expect that to grow to roughly greater than $600 million in the back half. And we've paused the share buybacks until we meet those objectives. And as we look into 2021 with growth and recovery, we'll re-evaluate the pace at which we do that.",0.2131214,0.936
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,90,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So, you know, obviously, you know, in an environment where demand drops significantly relative to capacity available in chemical intermediates products, you know, the prices are going to fall or rise, which is predominantly what we've seen. The only place where we've really seen you know, material, you know, spread compression, you know, due to competitive activities is you know, in this disconnect we saw in the second quarter between propane and propylene and that really resulted in some challenging raw material cost in the market that sets the price in the marketplace, which is PGP, obviously didn't go up and went down. And that was a tough combination. Fortunately, we've already seen that corrected back to a more normal relationship through July and the beginning of August here where PGP has gone up dramatically or propane has been sort of holding steady. So we feel good about how that's corrected already into this quarter. On the acid fuel side, we've seen some compression, obviously, as oil prices and methanol that's priced the marketplace comes off. We feel some of that compression relative to our cost structure which is principally based on coal. So those are the places where we're seeing some of the pressure but spreads overall have been relatively good; so that's not the story.",0.0162999,0.314
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,91,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As you can see in our revenue table, the bigger impact for us has been volume as opposed to price on the first half basis where you've really especially in second quarter, it had that impact on COVID related demand not being there and some of the export markets that we would normally clear capacity, not being as available when oil prices drop so much. Generally, that's not a high margin business for us but still it has a significant impact on the volume and that contribution margin comes in to pay for some of the integrated fixed costs to the overall complex. So those are really the key stories there. I think they're all due to extraordinary circumstances in the second quarter, a lot of this will continue into the third quarter, but no reason this won't recover as we go into next year.",0.0986145,-0.459

A big part of the snapback in that volume is actually in tires. The competitive dynamics are still there so pricing isn't going to improve for some period of time, but the volume is really starting to come back.",0.1393643,0.612
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,101,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we don't have any evidence that there's something else going on, John. As you said, it was incredibly stable in the 2008, 2009 recession. There is a general trend where the market is always sort of declining in that 2% to 3% range as we've said in the past, and we expect that to be the story this year. There's a lot of different stories out there at the moment that are all sort of breaking in the last couple of weeks where different cigarette companies are doing well and others are not doing well. So you really have to get in the details of what's going behind each of those companies. But overall, when we put it all together, we think market demand is declining that 2% to 3% range outside of China. China, the data suggests it's stable to sort of up maybe 2% which is about half of the cigarette demand of the world. So that's all sort of put together in the market outlook. When it comes to customer buying patterns as we have discussed many times in the past, it is a bit as we call it chunky, and what we saw is good demand, obviously, in the first quarter as well as good demand in the second quarter. Some of that was buying some incremental tow for security reasons, with all the uncertainty of COVID. And that's why we expect volumes to trend off modestly as we go into the third quarter, but overall we still view this as tow is very stable especially with the cost actions we're taking at the earnings and cash flow level. On the textile side, of course, which has been growing offset some of this underlying market decline on tow. We're not going to get that this year with the textile market being so challenged. It doesn't give us any concern for the long term. I think textiles is an incredibly exciting opportunity for us, especially now with the circular economy as I answered in the first question. Really see a lot of opportunities to grow in the target markets, right. So if you think about women's wear down about 15% year-over-year in the first half of the year, versus market of 30%.",0.0378973,0.962

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As I said, when we look at the forecast for this quarter, probably a 40% sequential improvement off of the second quarter in women's wear; the problem right now is some of the traditional markets that we've gone into like suit linings obviously not much demand for those right now in this environment as everyone's working virtually. And so that's offsetting some of those, but that will correct itself and we expect good growth out of that in next year as a way to continue filling the assets and levering the integrated complex up.",0.0855746,0.886

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, it is a very complicated market when you look at recycled content and we are doing our best to segment it. What's great about our strategy is molecular recycling does not require high-quality recycled content. We can use a product that has no other use. So we can take carpet, we can take textiles, we can take plastic that cannot be used in mechanical recycling and grind it up and use it in the methanol analysis plan for polyester recycling. So we don't have to compete against that high-quality stuff and the price there is going up a lot; significantly higher than virgin PET in Europe right now, last year almost 60%. But we don't have to compete with that. There's a little bit of that we'll buy in the beginning, but we can really access what is truly has no alternative use that's going into landfill.",0.3023635,0.754
EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,107,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think that the fourth quarter is awfully difficult to call at this point with all the uncertainties of what's going to happen with COVID, the election et cetera. But what I do think will happen is there'll be some markets where you'll have just normal seasonal decline demand like construction activity in the winter but I don't think you're going to see the same kind of inventory destocking that you've seen in the past because we've all been doing it pretty aggressively in the second quarter and in the third quarter so I think you avoid that relative to what happened last year. And if people are looking at next year and the economy is looking positive, you're going to actually probably having some people start building inventory to serve that demand as they go into the first quarter. So I couldn't pretend to know how all those are going to balance together. I know that we've managed our inventory aggressively in the second and third quarters so we're not going to be doing much destocking in the fourth quarter. So that's certainly going to help not just where we go with inventory, but also asset utilization will continue to get better as we go from 3Q to 4Q.",0.8488183,0.566

Demand could be a bit better than you might think. We look at it as sequential improvement from 3Q; I'm not sure we can get all the way back to 4Q of last year but somewhere in that range seems feasible. But I got to emphasize, we're not giving guidance for the year for a reason which is we have no idea what fourth quarter will look like at this stage, no one does.",0.1809291,-0.141

EMN-2020-Q2-2020-08-04,122,Answer,2020-08-04,2,2020,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'll take the first part and let you take the second part, Willie. On the revenue side, we expect recovery, and as I said that the mix hit that we took on the way down was our highest value segments. The innovation we're driving also tend to have margins way above company average in all the different products we've launched. So as you see volume recovery come, that mix leverage is pretty significant. You'll see that in advanced materials this quarter and you've seen it for years in advanced materials. So we expect a lot of pretty high incremental margins in a recovery scenario, especially with the cost actions we've taken. So you don't have any fixed cost headwinds offsetting that variable margin growth, and you've got this utilization benefit we've identified. So I think we're feeling pretty good about how the earnings can come back in that scenario, but it requires economies to recover. We're not about to try and tell you when we think we're going to get back to 2019 or 2018 levels in this economy, but we certainly expect given what we know today 2021 to be better than 2020.

January was about as expected, but after Chinese New Year demand was sluggish and did not pick-up as we had hoped. Destocking was evident throughout the quarter and a substantial contributor to our volume decline. That said March was a strong month and April orders gave us confidence we'll continue the trend upwards into the second quarter and we're seeing signs of destocking coming to an end across many of our end markets.",1.6591001,0.881

Tritan destocking coming to an end with primary demand intact, continued mix upgrade due to products like paint protection films and premium interlayer products, typical seasonality and improvement in the flow of the lower raw material costs in our inventory. Taking these factors together we expect, EBIT in the segment will be similar to the second quarter of 2018.

Additives & Functional Products also had strong sequential improvement with EBIT up $27 million or 22%. The sequential improvement was due to improved product mix and increased spreads.

Chinese tire producers have adjusted accordingly by destocking their inventories. As a result, tire additive competitors have excess capacity in China, which has caused some short-term competitive dynamics in our legacy products.

Obviously in the first quarter, our earnings came in a little bit lower than we expected and we have that adjustment in the second quarter.

So the additional actions are expected to contribute $40 million to our 2019 results. So I'd call those pretty permanent kind of reductions and again predominantly in the second half of the year.

That's a good portion of that is the anticipated severance of our restructuring programs.

As it relates to trade and the settlement of the trade dispute, what's your sort of sense from talking to customers about how activity or behavior or buying patterns will improve?",0.3979023,0.477
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,91,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,It sounds like there's already been some improvement sort of as people sense that a resolution is within sight. So how much of an incremental step up would you anticipate right away post settlement? Or is this something that's going to take a few months or a quarter before we sort of have a real sense of how much of a snap back there's going to be?,0.9351032,0.706
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,92,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Vincent, a great question, and it's obviously a pretty difficult one to forecast since we're depended on President Trump settling a trade dispute with President Xi and the timing of that is unknown or and the details of it are unknown. But based on everything we've seen, which is the same stuff you've seen, it seems like they're making good progress, and the odds of escalation now are going down. And I'd say that's very well covered here in the press in the U.S.",0.8459658,0.913
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,93,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But from what we can tell in China, they're pretty quiet. They're very being very careful about declaring any kind of victory or possible victory with their -- inside their country, because they just don't know what's going to happen with President Trump. So there's still a lot of caution and uncertainty in China today.",0.5199674,0.451
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,94,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But I'd say, the destocking is mostly playing out and behind us, so you've got the removal of that headwind. And primary demand is still out there including exports to some degree, but we really haven't seen any restocking yet. That could be material at some point, and we're not banking on much of that in our forecast, so that would be upside.

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,97,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So far on adhesives, the global underlying market growth rates for adhesives is very strong. It's in your consumables hygiene applications. And overall I'd say, it's pretty good. There's no question in China demand has been a bit off, especially in some applications. They are a little bit more consumer discretionary, and that's contributed to some of the pressure in the marketplace.

That is a huge sustainability trend. This market is no order -- preferably no order no VOC kind of product. We've now launched the best-in-class product for those applications with this sensitivity on the environment out there. And it's expected to grow quite well. We'll get that in the marketplace in the back half of this year towards the end, and that gives us another way to grow out of this business. And the raws and resin conversions also continues where same environmental trend raws have a lot of odor and smell too. Consumers don't want that.

So on the ethylene side as you just mentioned, we had a considerable headwind in ethylene last year, and the RGP investment we made this year, which is up and running incredibly well and actually performing better than we expected is taking us a long way in reducing the ethylene we sell this year in the merchant market and that helps mitigate a lot of that headwind giving us a year-over-year benefit.

It's just an indicator of the underlying market conditions.

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,108,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So that's factored into our guidance.

And in places where they do, we'll increase prices. We've have demonstrated we're very disciplined about managing prices. We offset all the raw material increases through the third quarter last year with price increases.

We're seeing demand recover there as well but it's more of a lag effect, so a little bit slower in its recovery.

Don't forget that EV comp on the fourth quarter basis -- look at what they did in fourth quarter 2017 versus fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect that to be growing on top of what we saw back in the fourth quarter of 2017.

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,148,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And so to give you some sense, if you think about just the first quarter, the flow through of lower raw material costs was only a benefit of roughly $10 million and that is only a small piece. And within that it was mostly a benefit in the commodities and still a headwind in these specialties. So as these lower raw materials slow, second quarter as well second half of the year you will see improved EBIT resulting from the flow through lower raws on top of the utilization and the volume/mix growth.",0.1447102,0.84
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,150,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I also want to emphasis asset utilization is a big deal guys. So when you have to slow the plants like we did last year in the fourth quarter to adjust the demand situation and even run them a little bit slow in the first quarter, your asset utilization, your fixed cost per kg goes up in a meaningful way. So as volume picks up that starts to accelerate how all the cost cuts we're doing can flow into a lower cost per kg and benefit earnings in the back half of the year.",1.0631622,0.872

If you even just go back and look at history here from 2014 to now, we've done a series of acquisitions here. We've delivered a significant amount of innovation growth on top of that. And we've grown the EBITDA from these two segments by over $500 million from 2014 and if you put on our constant-currency basis over $600 million.

No question, we in our portfolio have a high exposure to consumer discretionary spend. Transportation B&C, consumer durables, it's about 45% of the company's total revenue. So if you have a situation where there is a correction and demand in those spaces and that is clearly what we saw in 4Q, 2Q and for 4Q and 1Q and a little bit still dragging on into 2Q for AFP.",0.0028525,-0.893

But the good news is, we've already seen demand coming back in March and April. So that demand comes back, the economies improve and that value that we've created over the last five years through volume and mix growth comes back in a pretty dramatic fashion on the other side of the equation just like it went away comes back the same way.",0.3899756,0.929
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,155,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And so there's sort of sensitivity we have to consumer discretionary.

On a short-term basis, don't forget that these specialties have a long supply chain. And so when you have a disruption like these trade wars that's where you have some of the negative impact like you see in the fourth quarter and first quarter.

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,164,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"When it comes to the construction market, it's been relatively stable. So from an architectural interlayer's point of view, it has been great. Vast majority of where we're selling the layers is in Europe, where they do laminated glass and we've seen strong growth there through 2018 and that's continuing on through 2019 and that's pretty visible at the back order that you can see in construction.",0.7803586,0.937
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,165,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the architectural side, North America has been fine. Obviously, China and Europe have been a bit off but we're seeing some recovery there. One other thing I'd mentioned is environmental enforcement does create benefits as well. With this unfortunate accident that's occurred in China, we do see an impact on a few produces that we compete with being shutdown for environmental inspections and things like that. That's giving us a modest tailwind. We're not banking on much of that. But if that continues -- that enforcement continues, there will be an upside to our forecast.",0.1255094,0.743
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,168,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Duffy Fischer,Barclays,"Yeah. Good morning. First question, just around the raws again. I know you've got an accounting benefit that will flow through in the back half, but a lot of your suppliers would talk about kind of the same destocking events happening that you are seeing with your products. So, if you get that back half pickup in economic activity like you're expecting, what do you think the odds are when you look at all your raw materials and kind of the supply demand that actually prices there will rise fairly rapidly and maybe we're talking about raw material headwinds in the back half of the year?",0.0483963,0.723
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,169,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. When we look at the specific products that we buy, Duffy, I don't see there is a significant risk there. I mean, you can always get into oil price scenarios. And if demand driven where oil goes up then we'll have the demand market conditions to raise prices and we'll be fine. Supply driven events in oil is a different discussion. But we're not really worried about that with the raws that we buy, especially because the one that was a biggest problem for us in the back half of last year was PX and there's so much new capacity coming online.",0.3500407,0.027
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,170,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Duffy Fischer,Barclays,"Fair enough. And then just to jump to Fibers, can you breakout if you just look at say the EBITDA year-over-year kind of they're down $14 million, how much of that was China versus ex-China? And then do you think it will be difficult to get your Chinese business back once the deal is settled because obviously they are players inside China that have excess capacity they're probably back filling that today. Is that a structural step down do you think, or will that be pretty quick to come back?",0.0068729,0.52
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,171,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Yeah. As far as the demand goes in the first quarter I would say it's sort of balanced between the China factor and sort of just customer buying patterns across the quarters for this year with another customers.,0.5220049,0.178
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,172,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In regards to your second question, there is no competitor in China backfilling us. The -- all the companies -- or the plants that make tow in China are joint ventures with CNTC, our customer. They run those plans flat out every day as best as they possibly can every year which is why imports dropped when they add that capacity over the last five years.",0.5582722,0.459
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,173,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So the imports -- and we're now down to pretty small levels are just being shifted around from plants -- to different plants that are not outside of the U.S. But we have a great relationship with our customer there and they are working with us and we believe we'll get back in.,0.8247759,0.807

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,177,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So there's a lot of PX coming online. The big chunks in the back half of this year are just traditional PX plants, not the sort of oil or the chemical things. But we -- there will be some passing along with some of that PX value to some of our customers which is natural and the logic -- I started with in the beginning of the Q&A session here I'll reference you back to which is you got to have a balanced approach to the customers if you want them continuing buy from you and we work with the same customers for the last decade and I hope the next decade. And so we got to have respect and trust and innovation together.",0.994295,0.954

EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,181,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"Thank you for squeezing me in. Mark, I had a question for you on interlayers. In your prepared remarks, I think you referenced double-digit growth prospects for Saflex. And you threw out I believe 20% in Europe. And so I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what is driving that? The build rates have obviously been tough and my recollection is that Sekisui was adding some capacity in the Netherlands.",0.0960452,0.772
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,182,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,So perhaps you could elaborate are you gaining share? Is it penetration mix heads-up displays construction what would be driving that premium?,0.7873048,0.487
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,183,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So, specifically that 20% applies to heads-up display interlayers in Europe not the overall interlayer business. So what you're doing is you're replacing standard interlayers with one that includes acoustics and heads-up display. And we're the world leader in that specific product, but it's a very small percentage of the overall market right now. There's not that many heads-up displays in cars yet. So we're seeing just tremendous growth as we're adding that feature because auto OEMs are always looking us a way to value up cars especially in the slow growth markets. They want more feature packages to offer -- to get more volume per car which is a great lever for us in the different kind of features we had. So that's going quite well. And I'd also add the architectural is also growing really well in Europe as well. So that gives us a way to offset the underlying auto market trends. It's very impressive that performance films and interlayers is stable in this auto market.",0.3500407,0.989
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,184,Question,2019-04-26,1,2019,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"So Mark, how would you characterize the all-in structural growth rate in the interlayers business, I don't know over the next three-plus years or so?",0.2153539,0.382
EMN-2019-Q1-2019-04-26,185,Answer,2019-04-26,1,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think that again volume mix, we continue to expect that the Advanced Materials segment including ASP will grow sort of double the underlying market growth rates.

And thank you for the updated outlook on 2022. And to that affect if I could just ask you Mark, what are you assuming for auto production 2022 versus 2021?",0.6829344,0.785
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,6,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Gregory A. Riddle,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Good morning, Vince. And what we're assuming is that the auto production situation remains pretty challenged as it has been the back half of this year as we go into next year. But things get modestly better through the year especially in the back half but there's no heroic assumptions about auto recovery next year versus this year in the forecast. So depending on everyone's view, you can adjust up or down relative to that assumption.",1.0988499,0.557
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,7,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Gregory A. Riddle,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Okay. And if we just look at the third quarter, can you help us bridge how the specialty portfolio volume would have performed if you ex out the impact from auto. So what's your -- what the other businesses are doing on an underlying rate?",0.1178116,0.968
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,8,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Gregory A. Riddle,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Good morning, Vincent. What I would highlight, first of all, is again, we have mix included in that for the quarter. And specifically in our enhanced materials which is more exposed to the OEM. And if you back that out, volumes would have actually been down because we had very favorable mix in the quarter as we think about year-over-year performance especially. But sequentially, it was definitely down in the premium areas. If you think about it, the first half of the year, mix was incredibly strong and driving a lot of variable margin growth and margin improvement. And there was a mix shift a bit in the third quarter. It wasn't just autos, it was also outbound logistics constraints on our specialty plastics business are getting high-value products like Tritan to the market. Demand is incredibly strong out there, but logistics, as you all know, are also indulging, so the earnings could've been considerably better with those two factors, if they were a bit better.",0.4905191,0.361
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,11,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. Good morning. And Mark, again, thank you for this '22 guidance. On that guidance, could you just walk through the segments and what how you expect them to perform in '22 versus '21?",2.0823146,0.927
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,12,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. And good to hear from you, David. When you think about the overall segments, obviously when you start with the specialty businesses, as we've noted here, there's just tremendous growth that we see possible on a number of factors. We've got volume mix that should be significant driver with the economy to some degree growing with the markets in it. And there's also a lot of pent-up demand out there to drive additional growth versus GDP as consumers fulfill desires that they can't get due to supply chain constraints. And we're restocking inventory, which has not at all happened yet in this year.",0.6792991,0.962
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,13,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that's all quite positive. And when you think about that, especially the pent-up demand part, I think that's more significant in the AM segment. So we've given you a breakdown of AM being about 70% of that several margin improvement versus AFP. The innovation is also incredibly strong especially in AM where we're going to continue to outperform the underlying markets in significant way you've seen this in this year. You saw it last year and AM, you've seen it for the last decade. The circular offerings are also accelerating a lot of growth for us in the AFP business. You've seen $600 million new business revenue from innovation.",0.1756316,0.981
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,14,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that's a good momentum that we take into next year. So again, those are a bit more biased towards the AM as AFP businesses also getting traction. And then market segment strategies, we continue to focus on the markets that are growing. Whether it's luxury EVs, water treatment, care chemicals where we pick up a lot of just natural market growth. And importantly to keep in mind a lot of growth I just described, all of it's high-value mix, both within the segment and certainly at the corporate level. So there's a lot of leverage to have, AM has a significant increase in earnings next year when you think about those elements and that's also true if for AFP to have good solid growth. And then on the spread side, it's the same thing you've got -- really headwinds, obviously, this year and prices catching up to rise through the year.",0.0130399,0.965
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,15,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And there will be -- with the price actions we're taking through the fourth quarter and a lot of effective price increases on January 1 in businesses, you're going to see a pretty big step-up in earnings there from spreads getting better as long as you believe raw materials are going to plateau relative to the back-half of this year and then trend off in the back half of next year, which is our underlying assumption. So then you pick up a pretty significant spread tailwind is the same thing. AFP has done a better job of keeping track with prices this year because they have a lot more cost pass-through contracts. Half of the price increase in third quarter was CPTs in AFP whereas AM, the interlayers business in particular, has a lot of annual price contracts. So, it takes a while to get those prices moving up. So again, that supports that 70-30 split on the spread side, too.",0.5203749,0.983
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,16,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Those businesses that are both going to deliver considerable growth in earnings in OEM, as well as when you look at AFPX on a recasted basis minus the divestitures. So that's a lot of the growth there. Fibers, I think we'll also be renegotiating, putting prices in on probably more than half of their revenue come January 1. And so earnings will improve there. And then of course, since [Indiscernible] you've got normalization, that's going to happen in that business, but it's going to be offset by volume growth that'll be pretty substantial next year relative to this year in [Indiscernible] plasticizers and some other growth opportunities that we have as well as less shutdown. So, that all helps out. And of course, there's the cost tailwinds that we've given to you, that spread across all of these segments that give them high growth. So, that's where how it balances out, David.",0.306031,0.572
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,17,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Perfect. And just on buybacks Mark, could buybacks approach a billion dollars next year?",0.5664222,0.0
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,22,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Good morning. Mark, you announced a nice deal to divest the adhesives business and of course the Crystex deal is still pending. I was wondering if you could just walk us through, at a high level, what your thoughts are on capital redeployment and just the portfolio composition moving forward. Does this bring the Company to a reasonably steady state in 2022 or is there more work to do in terms of the mix in the portfolio over the next couple of years?",3.2245314,0.985
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,23,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, we certainly like the portfolio we now have. We think that [Indiscernible] businesses are very well-positioned to deliver strong growth in earnings, and increasing -- improving margins, and the fibers and the Olefins part or the CI part of the business is integral part of our integration scale, cash flow, etc. So we like the portfolio as it's configured right now as we look at -- deploying capital to your question, Kevin, on delivering more growth from the total Company. When it comes to capital deployment, obviously, our free cash flow remains incredibly strong, and our balance sheet now is also strong with delivering being in our rear-view mirror. So as we look forward, I think we should think about how we deploy capital on multiple fronts. First, you should expect capex to increase a bit next year as we have the combination of specialty growth and the first methanolysis plant that we're building here in Kingsport.",0.0480848,0.816
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,24,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So normal capex growth to support our specialty strategies in that $500 to $600 million range. And then of course, you've got a good portion of that $250 million of the Kingsport plant being spent next year. Now we're balancing some of the specialty capex between next year and pushing some of it to '23 to keep this in balance across the 2 years. capex will be a bit higher for that. Then after that, you look at how am I going to deploy my balance sheet and cash? And there's really 4 buckets. The first is the potential to continue investing in the circular economy.",0.6483293,0.98
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,25,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're pursuing multiple projects beyond this first plant. If we can achieve the conditions that we've talked about in the past about those being very attractive investments and very stable sources of earnings, those projects could be very accretive to earnings and our ROIC. They're very attractive from a return point of view, and that could be a use of where we go with our balance sheet. The second of course, is bolt-on M&A, where we like to ramp up that level from where we've been in the last couple of years. There's returning cash to shareholders which I think will be significant as we move forward. And of course, our growing dividend. So, it'll be a balance of capital deployment I think, like we've always had across these areas. There's a lot of attractive investment opportunities for us right now, and so we're really excited about how we can deploy capital and create growth for our shareholders.",0.0517522,0.765
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,28,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, good morning and congrats on the divestitures. And just a follow-up Mark, you did talk about uses of cash and possible bolt-on M&A s. What are the current valuation levels like? And what does your current pipeline look in that regard?",0.702119,0.949
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,29,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so the bolt-on M&A pipeline, there's a number of ideas that we have that can be attractive and advanced materials in AFP as we try and buildout our additive portfolio in AFP. And accelerate our access to additional markets in advanced materials, especially in Specialty Plastics. But as you've noted, Frank, you have to be careful, there is a lot buy-side interest in pursuing M&A right now, as everyone has improved balance sheets and cash. So, we're going to be disciplined as always. We're proud of the fact that we don't overpay for assets whether its at the -- the large ones we've done in the past for the bolt-ons we're focusing on now. And so we'll see. And there may be some constraints because we're just not going to run around overpay.",0.6035045,0.44

And if I could come back to the automotive piece, you referenced that you are doing better than you had in -- back in 2018, and obviously, with builds being off, where do you stand in the interplay between your sales into the automotive space versus where the build rate is today, and how should investors think about that interplay going into next year?",0.6466993,0.951
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,31,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With advanced materials, our OEM exposure is bigger than AFPX [Indiscernible] one of the difference is AFPs ' -- their automotive exposure is about half-refinish and half - OEMs. So they're a lot more balanced in the OEM production drama as [Indiscernible] -- just continuing to improve. But on the OEM side, the supply chain is really short between OEM production and the production of our interlayers. So that actually happens pretty quickly. So as they're adjusting their production rates weekly, we're adjusting right there with them. So, we're realizing that in a pretty quick, faster. The performance films business has actually done really well through the third quarter because Companies, the dealers, the auto dealers are out there trying to upgrade the value they were getting on each car. And so selling our paint protection films, window films was a nice adder to few cars that they have to sell.",1.7082315,0.913
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,32,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But even that, it seemed to start to catch up to us on what they have to sell right now. So we're feeling a bit of that as we go into the fourth quarter. But I think that as they have more cars to sell or produced more cars, you're going to see that pickup in sales happen pretty quickly for us because there's really no inventory in the channel between us and the primary market. That I think is good news as supply chains at some point are going to start mocking or getting back in control and production will be there. Clearly in-market demand is quite strong, so there's plenty of pent-up demand of people who want to buy cars. When you look at just how much they're paying for used cars right now. They are clearly -- there's a lot of demand out there. So, I think if we have recovery, it'll be pretty fast. It's -- and it will be a little slower in AFP because that supply chain is longer.",0.4111654,0.844

EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,36,Question,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Great. Thanks. I just wanted to I guess, talk about '22 initially or what's your initial comments there. What are you expecting on the last question as far as global auto production? And it appears to us that many Companies in your position are actually assuming rates below the IHS recovery. So maybe you can just comment on that first. Thanks.",0.4013855,0.558
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,37,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So on a 4Q basis, I think our view is below IHS. I think IHS is from what I can tell monitoring their view downward for the fourth quarter. So production, obviously, what we're assuming is similar to maybe a little bit better than third quarter but not any significant change to help in the quarter. When it comes to next year, let's be honest, it's anyone's guess, right when the supply chain on components is going to improve and production is going to improve. I think we are being cautious and not assuming much improvement in the first half of the year. But we do assume that eventually these issues are going to get addressed and so there will be some modest improvement in demand in the back half of the year. But our guidance is not based on some substantial improvement in order demand.",0.1242869,0.7

EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,39,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"No, not at this time. So, we're very happy with the [Indiscernible] portfolio. The two obvious questions that come up in the past is fibers and Olefins. On the fibers front, I remind everyone that it is deeply integrated into our overall [Indiscernible] business. We have a lot of biopolymers and especially as we're selling off of the stream and advanced materials and the AFP and with the significant change in the world's view around waste, plastic, and climate, we just have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us in both AM and AFP with that integrated stream.",1.3023635,0.958

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You'll learn a lot more about that at innovation day where we're going to identify a bunch of new opportunities we're pursuing that can be quite substantial. And textiles growth in itself in Fiverr has been actually quite strong. It's incredible how the textile growth have been 80% up year-over-year. Obviously, on the challenge market that still tremendous growth, offsetting not just tow market decline, but also that discontinued product. So, that's business as well is at the position now where textile growth will offset tow market decline or better",0.6108394,0.936

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"and where in fact, demand is exceeding our expectations where we're having to pull forward conversion of total assets to making textiles. So that business is on track and it generates a huge amount of cash flow that supports all the investments we're making in growth in AM and AFP. Olefins, it's bit of a similar story where we're dramatically improving the quality earnings in that business. Obviously, it's doing really well. But we've been taking a lot of actions over the last 3 years to improve what is the new normal for this business, which is more likely probably around 300 million. And there are things like closing the Singapore plant where we had a very disadvantaged raw material energy position, that's a big upgrade in the quality of that business with it closed.",1.1703341,0.917

The [Indiscernible] investments, giving us flexibility to reduce ethylene when it's not attractive and make it when it is, that reduces volatility around that. And we've got a new investment, we'll tell you about it in innovation day, for modest capital that will significantly improve our Olefin production flexibility.

And we have a lot of our businesses on cost pass-through Tong contracts that give us a certain amount of stability, probably about 40% revenue. There's a lot of things in the Olefins space we've done to improve it. We're obviously disciplined about our portfolio. But as you look at the significant growth opportunities we have in front of us.

I think you're one of the few chemical Companies. Also you're creating this specialty brand with circular economy -- in the circular economy products like Tritan, on one hand and then you have to fight commoditizing businesses on the other hand, like additives and [Indiscernible] And so like many other chemical companies, you have to constantly fight that battle between businesses commoditizing and then innovating. So, what -- would -- the one that you think you have the right portfolio, to move that portfolio solidly into specialties, would you look at making a big specialty acquisition or would you look at just continuing more bolt - ons?",0.99837,0.977

We're always looking at how to enhance our portfolio and obviously, we did significant portfolio change way ahead of many with the addition Solutia, Taminco, and divesting a lot of commodity business. It's easy to forget history sometimes, but we moved out about 3.5 billion of commodities and added 4.2 billion of revenue. And in specialties out of 10 billion is a huge portfolio change, so we do really like the portfolio we have now. And yes, we had optimized it around some underperforming businesses. And I'm proud of our teams delivering on that restructuring activity, which is never easy, to get to where we are. We don't really feel the need to get a lot bigger.",0.206194,0.966

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We think we're at a good scale to continue to invest in fundamental R&D, product development, as well as application development to grow. And I think that the circular economy on top of very attractive specialty growth, anywhere we can take that with multiple plants is a game changer for how we can grow the Company and how it could be valued. So we really are focusing a lot on how we focus on circular. We've got two extremely advantaged streams in the polyester, and the way we can do circular economy is a very advantaged stream to grow in this current macro-environment that want to get rid of plastic waste and improve our impact on climate. And in the cellulosic stream is also incredibly compelling. There's just a tremendous amount of opportunities when you've got a polymer that 60% biopolymer, with our new recycling technology there, 40% recycled from plastic waste.",0.0884271,0.925

And that last part about biodegradability is increasingly important, and we'll tell you more about that in Innovation Day and some of the opportunities in front of us. So we see a lot of growth in capital deployment in that direction to deliver a lot of organic growth from the portfolio we have right now where we don't really feel the pressure to run out and do some large M&A and at the prices today for large M&A, that's really attractive.

And Mark a question for you on circular polymers, business, feedstock availability is a major issue as you know. Could you discuss what progress you're making this year in securing access to necessary waste streams to grow that business?",0.294621,0.565
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,58,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Yeah, we're making great progress. The advantage we have right now is we're pretty much ahead of the industry and going to commercial scale in building the largest molecular recycling plant on the planet I think at this point. So that gives us an advantage on how we show up with different suppliers for what we need. There is no doubt that there's plenty of plastic waste. I mean, when you look at polyester, just in the U.S., you've got over 20 billion pounds of possibly waste a year. About 40% of that is packaging and only about 25% to 30% that can be recycled today. So when it gets recycled, frankly, most of it goes into textiles, not bottle to bottle. And so as you tap into that stream and then it vanish to methanolysis [Indiscernible] if they can use, what can't be mechanical recycled from packaging but it can also use carpet textiles which almost all end up in landfill.",0.6092095,0.989
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,59,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So accessing a 100,000 tons of feedstock out of that significantly large number when you're the first showing up to secure it, it is challenging but doable. And the infrastructure out there clearly needs to improve in the U.S. as we get consumers to recycle more and policy to support it and infrastructure in place to recycle it as we look at plants 2, 3, and 4. But as we look at the first one, we're confident that we can do this and we will provide more detail in Innovation Day. You hear that a lot today about you'll get more detail in Innovation Day, but it's a better forum to provide more detail on this question, which is incredibly important and we're very focused on it.",0.3427058,0.511

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, when you think about it in the Specialty Plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in frightened. Market demand exceeding our logistics capability, serving the market, and we're even capacity constrained into the second quarter, which is why we converted a line over to serve Tritan. And now we got that capacity came online through the third quarter and positioned to serve growth next year. And it's coming from a range of markets. There is the traditional markets that are being driven with accelerated growth with our renewed recycled content, like hydration that's delivering a lot of growth and housewares are those traditional markets that we've always grown in are being accelerated. And then on top of that, we are getting access to new markets that we wouldn't have normally had. The [Indiscernible] we shared with you, it's generally black conductors are great example and it's a power tool.",0.2204564,0.772

We normally go into optical clarity kind of applications with Tritan. But this is the housings for power tools. And that customer adopted us because one, they're committed to addressing their skilled three climate from suppliers and recycled content was a way to start making progress on that, especially as our technology has a lower carbon footprint in a meaningful way relative to a normal fossil fuel process. And they wanted to maintain their quality. So a lot of these applications, you can't use mechanical recycling at all because when you're just blending mechanical recycling with virgin, the quality of the product goes down on multiple dimensions. And you can't have that kind of a compromise in the power tool.",0.797881,0.756
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,66,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we were able to provide recycled content, carbon footprint improvement, and zero compromise on the performance of the product. And that's an incredibly important aspect of why we're growing. And then the third part of it was actually partnership for them. So they want to make sure they are aligned to the Company that could scale with them. And was going to be a reliable supplier of this product. There's a lot of Companies starting up out there, but they're startups and they haven't scaled up their technology. So when we can show up and provide a product where we've been -- have that 40-year history in doing that analysis, and we've got 100 years of history of supplying products to people very reliably, that's what was incredibly important to them and who they're going to choose.

It's a wide spectrum of things including our cellulosics and eyewear, etc. It's a lot of growth in SP. Obviously, the interlayers in Performance Films businesses are tied to the auto production recovery as we discussed, but mix is still important and we still see the mix improving faster than the absolute volume in production because the first thing that the OEMs are going to produce -- there are more luxury high-end value cars when they start addressing their chip and component shortages.

So Greg, on AFP, I think it's the same thing. Coatings has had tremendous growth this year and that growth will continue. And there's a lot of pent-up demand in Coatings as you all know, with our customers struggling significantly with supply chain challenges.

So, there's a lot of different vectors across the entire segment that remains -- that's well-positioned for growth in the markets that it serves.

EBITDA margins have been in the high teens for last couple of quarters. It sounds like it will stay maybe in that range for maybe the next three quarters.

I think that when we think about normalized, we think that's going to be around $300 million. Obviously, there's a path to normal as we go through next year where we expect at least in the first half market conditions to stay relatively tight. Obviously, there's some loosening of those markets even as we go into the fourth quarter based on our guidance. A lot of it is -- we had tremendously high spot -- high-value spot sales and incredibly tight market conditions when you look at the second and third quarter.

Let me frame it this way, which is we expect total proceeds to be about 1.8 billion from these transactions and actually 1.7 that over the next few months. So as we look ahead also, this was about 8% of our EBITDA. So, as you think about the flow of the market cap, we're looking at roughly 1.2 billion. I'll look at that as probably the floor. As you think about offsetting dilution and paying taxes, that'll raise the number up to roughly 1.5 or so. We're going to put that money to work starting here in Q4 with the tires closing week, which we expect here in the near term. With that, also given our Balance Sheet on the tires position, we don't expect to pay down any debt related to that. Obviously, as we look at 2022, we'll see at the timing of getting the proceeds and also managing our debt matter.

EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,79,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So if you looked at, and we will be providing a recast so you can see it in specific numbers. But roughly what you'd see between 2018 and '21 is a roughly flat similar to EBITDA from '18 to '21 when you have excluded the 1/3 of AFP as we've been discussing it. So I think that's quite stable when you consider that China trade war and then pandemic and recovering out of it. And that is based on when you look at it relative to '21, an improvement in volume and mix that's been meaningful. Spreads are probably a bit challenged relative to 18, just as pricings are -- pricing is still catching up to raws. But, overall, very well-positioned segment to deliver pretty strong earnings growth next year relative to that recast number. And that volume mix comes from everywhere. It's coatings, it's animal attrition, it's care chemicals, water treatment, even specialty fluids except for aviation in 21.

Prompters were up everywhere, but obviously prices are up more than raw materials and CI where we're lagging price-wise in the specialties. Those too do hedge each other out. That actually provides earnings stabilities. If you're focused on earnings stability, a bit of a balance when you've got CI, just 20% of your earnings actually provides some benefits in times like this as your prices are catching up to specialties.

The important part of our strategy and our story is not spread, right? We've been very clear about this, right? Our strategy is growing volume and high-value mix in that volume against of an asset base that we continue to upgrade with that mix to deliver, increasing our OIC, as well as deploying more capital for that high-value mix.

You've had that this [Indiscernible] -rating that seems very consistent with commodity companies, commodity chemicals like a [Indiscernible] They've sort of seeing that same de -rating. And yet you've been on this evolution upgrade the portfolio. And so there seems to be a pretty stark dislocation from the market perception or appreciation of those efforts and what I would guess are the internal expectations and perceptions there.

And that's why we're working so diligently right now with countries and brands around the world, especially in U.S. and Europe right now, who want to solve those challenges. With the brands, look at this situation.",0.2118989,-0.494
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,98,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"They've got two goals. They got to address packaging waste, and specifically, plastic waste is getting a lot of attention. But if we switched to plastics, somebody else is still going to manage that waste. So if you look at this, they've committed to very high recycled content targets and there isn't remotely enough mechanical recycling product out there to supply that need reliably. In addition, the price of mechanical recycled, PET is going up dramatically in Europe and now as well in the U.S. And the brands are worried about how that -- how much that's going to keep going up. And they are also doing lifecycle analysis on the carbon footprints and not just plastic, but alternative materials that they could consider.",1.2310513,-0.797
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,99,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And unfortunately, you run into a problem which is all the alternate materials have a worst climate footprint. You recently saw Wendy's switch from coated paper cups to plastic because plastic has got a much better climate footprint and can be recycled where the coated paper cannot be recycled. So the brands are very focused on how to recycle plastic for a lot of applications and realizing that molecular recycling is the only way forward, especially long-term, if you want to keep your product quality the same, then mechanic recycle is limited on how it can be used. And it degrades over time.",0.3166259,0.974
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,100,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if you want an infinite solution, you've got to have molecular recycling as part of the solution. So engagement strong, the need to build more plants is there. And we're driving to find a way to do that under the right conditions. And they are attracted to us because our scale -- our technology scalable now, where the startups are still piloting and trying to figure out how to scale up, so that's also drawing a lot of attention to us. So we feel good about where we're at. We're excited about doing this. But to be clear, we're not going to build additional plants unless we get the contractual commitments for off-take that give us stable earnings.",0.1230644,0.0

And then just as a follow-up, because CIP process can take a lot more different types of plastics than PRT. So how should we think about the PRT versus CIP mix as both these processes start ramping up in the years ahead?",0.7241239,0.929
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,102,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Well, first of all, they're actually a great compliment as technologies together at this site because we have a unique proprietary way to separate unsorted waste plastic that just separates it from polyester to everything else at a much lower cost. So that's one of the feedstock sourcing advantages that we have that I should have mentioned earlier. Then that allows us to take that mix waste plastic in the CRT, take it into our asset yields stream and make cellulosic biopolymers that gives us a lot of sourcing flexibility. So, we see both technologies creating a lot of value and the CRT is also through the cellulosics drawing a lot of attention.",0.6776691,0.888

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We've always have -- we've had a biopolymer for 100 years going to go back to acetate films with Kodak and we've created this huge spectrum of applications off of that core technology in AM, AFP, and fibers. But with the recent change in focusing on climate, focusing on plastic waste, in our recycling, you can also have biodegradable products as a way to have circular life. And that's drawing a lot of attention around the cellulosic stream. We can take back polymer and put it back in the CRT, or we can also provide ones that biodegrade based on the application. So lot of interest in growth there as well, that we're really excited about.",0.0851671,0.44

I mean, hearing in the call and hearing you talk about so many factors that are going to catch up and be beneficial. Just wondering, are you being just very conservative with regards to your EPS range of 9.5 to 10, because considering all the catch-up on raw material and the volume leverage that you were talking about in your specialty businesses.

I think what I'd say is we're sharing our best thinking with you right now of what we know. Obviously there's a lot of uncertainty in the future. Things we are certain about is we know we can control our costs, right? And we have a very aggressive transformation program going that -- when you look at operational transformation cost-cutting plus variable comp tailwind, that's about $200 million of tailwind that offsets about $80 million to $100 million of inflation.

That is controllable. We can control the pace of that based on how the market is doing, and that does include some pre -production expense on starting up. [Indiscernible] some other plans when you think about that number. But those are controllable. Obviously there is uncertainty about where CI is going to go. I think we've got a reasonable assumption, but we'll defer to the to some other companies on that and where the markets are.",0.4413203,0.84
EMN-2021-Q3-2021-10-29,116,Answer,2021-10-29,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then on the specialty side, what I'd say is we do feel good about the growth potential, the innovation to create leverage growth on -- along these markets and that spreads will be a tailwind. But there's still a lot of uncertainty about -- automotive demand has many of these questions I have highlighted, there is uncertainty about where raw materials are going to trend and how they progress from where we are now in next year as well as distribution costs.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So what we're confident is if you look at it in 3 buckets, you've got divested earnings offset by share repurchases. You've got a bucket of CI spread normalization offset by cost reductions and then you're asking a question which is, can specialties grow next year relative to this year in a variable margin? And I think we've laid out a case where we think the answer that is very much yes, but I'm not going to get into trying to be more precise about that until we get to January and have a better look at the world we live in at that point.",0.3109209,0.827

We're incredibly excited about Innovation Day coming up in December. It's been a while since we've had that kind of opportunity to really get more into the detail with investors on how we're going to grow this Company and deploy our balance sheet to create a lot of very attractive growth.

We had solid results in the third quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment which has deteriorated in the second half of this year. EPS for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter, especially considering the local electrical outage that caused a shutdown at our Longview site. We took actions to offset a decline in volumes, as our teams are focusing on what they can control to manage costs better, accelerate our innovation programs and remain disciplined with discretionary spending among other actions which led to the solid performance.",0.2506112,0.901

Consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we returned $583 million to stockholders through the first nine months of 2019, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are also focused on improving the strength of our balance sheet by de-levering $300 million for the full year. And finally, we expect our free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion.",0.7167889,0.971
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,9,Remarks,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Two additional highlights, I am especially proud of. Earlier this week, we announced that we have achieved commercial operation of our carbon renewal technology or CRT, which is a form of chemical recycling. This is a significant step forward in our efforts to help solve the problem of plastic waste and accelerate the circular economy. CRT is a game changer for recycling, because it provides an end of life solution for many plastics from a variety of sources that have no alternative use and end up in landfill or the ocean. CRT is operated here in Kingsport at our largest manufacturing site, so we can take full advantage of our integration to make this happen. This means a plastic waste we recycle through CRT will go into products used in markets we are already participating, including textiles, cosmetics, personal care and ophthalmics. And with CRT, plastic waste can be recycled in infinite number of times without degradation of quality unlike mechanical recycling.",0.396903,0.716

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Also consistent with my corporate comments, we expect a normal seasonal deceleration in demand in the fourth quarter which will offset benefits from lower raw material costs and cost actions. All-in, we think the fourth quarter EBIT will be up significantly year-over-year. Putting it all together we expect Advanced Materials EBIT to grow in the low single-digits for the full year of 2019.

First, volume is lower due to weak demand environment, but also increased in competitive pressure as markets outside of the United States are increasingly challenged by global trade issues. Also remember the cost of the turnaround of our - largest cracker in Longview, Texas is in both the third and fourth quarters. So a similar amount of the cost of that planned shutdown will be in the fourth quarter.

This has been somewhat offset by slower demand and more traditional applications such as suit linings and tapes due to slower economic growth. With that said, we remain confident that we are on track with our textiles initiatives to offset the expected continued decline in tow demand in the long-term. In particular, I am very excited about how we can accelerate growth in Naia with carbon renewal technology adding recycled content to a product that is already bio-based.",0.4685853,0.943

We continue making progress in closing new business from innovation and market development initiatives. But the increased trade uncertainty including from the U.S. China trade dispute has caused a meaningful deceleration in industrial activity around the world, including Asia and Europe and now here in the U.S. In this kind of economic environment, we are resolutely focused on the things that we can control.

However, this market context is leading to lower volumes in the second half of the year than we had previously expected. There is some continuing pockets of de-stocking related to lower demand such as transportation in Europe and the U.S. And we are also seeing some customers extend maintenance downtimes and shift turnarounds into the fourth quarter to manage inventory due to this deceleration that was not expected in the summer.",0.5203749,0.167

While we have always considered, you think about that strategic cash that we have after we funded our own - already organic growth. We love the opportunity to pursue opportunities of growth and bolt-on acquisitions through M&A. And I think we would just have to do that in a smart way. I've always told the business teams that if they find a great attractive bolt-on acquisition or acquisition in general, we'll find a way to finance it and we'll find a way to finance it that's still consistent with our investment grade credit rating.",0.9055533,0.981
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,49,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you. Good morning everyone. A question on Chemical Intermediates, the agriculture impact on the amines, obviously we know its tough season in the U.S., do we need to lapse that meaning, do you need the channel inventory to be drawn down before you are going to sell back through so that this could be an issue all the way through the middle of next year or is it already sort of played out?",0.3248115,0.719
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,50,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, Vincent. From what we can see and what our customers are telling us there one of the volume challenges we are having the back half of this year is their efforts to take their inventory down given the weak season we had this year. Our belief is they will achieve those goals and get back to sort of what is a sort of normal production strategy next year and we will see the benefits of that demand.",0.2893236,-0.128
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,51,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Okay. And can I also ask you the other and corporate costs appear to be up a lot in the quarter, was there a reason for that and how should we think about that number next year?",1.5001639,0.296
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,52,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So if you think about the year-over-year impact of any other segment the primary driver has been that higher pension costs that we talked about, the $30 million or roughly $0.20 impact. And most of that which is really driven by the discount rate as well as the lower assets we started the year, that's really what drove the delta - great management of our cost and innovation programs. So the other areas, so it's really the pension cost. As I think about 2020, a little early, but you have already seen the discount rates coming down, so that could very well improve our pension costs next year, we will see if that holds true as we finish out the year.",3.9242054,0.944
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,56,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Really there is two main drivers and that other cash items, Jeff, that are kind of an anomaly this year. First, last year and the end of the third quarter of '18, we had a $65 million insurance receivable that we collected the following month. Obviously, we don't have that kind of receivable this year. And then secondly, this year, we actually have a higher restructuring accrual, a higher than last year because of the events that took place early in this year and that's roughly $25 million. So those are the two main drivers of note. The other things are just the normal things you see resulting from timing of tax payments, other miscellaneous payables-receivables. So you shouldn't see this magnitude of change next year just because of those two things I just mentioned.",0.1507742,0.318
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,64,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, first I have learned my lesson about predicting the macro economy this year and exactly what to interpret from any order pattern in one month. I think there is a lot of volatility uncertainty out there, where you go back and forth between an escalation that trade war in August and where there is Phase 1 progress that's debatable in October and there's just a lot of uncertainty that's impacting business and consumer confidence out there. Especially in China, and how that's impacted their economy and sort of global effect that as places like Europe and Southeast Asia, so dependent on exporting to China and you can even now see it impacting sort of U.S. industrial activity. So it's a little hard to predict how this is going to trend, but I would tell you that as we look at the impacted - that our guidance and performance has had through the year it is entirely a volume mix story. Where we were in July, we were expecting the economy to be stable relative to the second quarter as we said. Obviously things escalated and that's why our volume forecast came off - were actually off a bit as Curt mentioned in 3Q, and now as we go into 4Q with this slower activity plus normal seasonality leads to this decline in volume, but it's all hard to interpret.",0.4938875,-0.734
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,66,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the entire - for AFP in total the entirety of the hit is a volume mix and asset utilization story. So if you look at the total segment altogether spreads are about flat year-over-year. Obviously there is a bit of a currency hit, but it's much more moderate in the second half of the year. So it is totally volume mix hit on the impact that has on variable margin as well as the impact it has on asset utilization. But as I said, it's sort of a two-thirds, one-thirds story where we have improving spreads in some places and and compressing spreads in others netting out to flat. That's not the margin story.",2.207824,0.885
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,69,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the only part of to make that's in the one third is formic acid. So when we bought Taminco we were very excited about the Alkylamines platform and the value of that integrated platform into a wide range of end markets. They had acquired a small business in formic acid about a year ahead of buying to Taminco for us. That was a business we'd actually looked at and didn't find very attractive, but which is part of the deal that we had to accept. So it's a business that just has some competitive challenges, but it's a very small part of income.",0.0399348,0.834

EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,77,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"What I'd say is actually October orders are holding similar to September where they normally start trending off seasonally. So I don't want to overstate the October order claim, but it's certainly coming in a bit better than we had forecasted. I think it's just - customers are managing and growing with a little more optimism and we're holding in reasonably well. I can say there is any specific reason I can point to you at this stage.

Mark, when you look across your portfolio, do you see opportunities for rationalization of assets.

We're not going to talk about it on this call, but we have several asset options under investigation for that reason. But our focus is always on innovation being the core thing.

EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,84,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"Okay. And then secondly for Curt, it seems as though you have put all the capital budget to some degree, maybe you can talk about what has changed there and what your preliminary views of the trajectory could be looking into 2020 and beyond?",0.2050515,0.226
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,85,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. On the capital front, what we've been doing is this clause, we are making some adjustments to the investments we make mostly of those are growth investments, just because of the environment and we're not quite sure when we're going to need that new capacity. We've already added a large portion of capacity to support our growth this year and last year. So we've kind of just tweak things because we can move things out just because the demand environment is not there right now. And then we've got a great capital team that's also being disciplined on the amount of support capital that's needed to run this company in this kind of environment. Looking at next year, I still keep it right now in the same range we are at today. But a lot of it's going to depend on what the economic environment is. If it's starting to improve, we might pick up our capital a little bit, if it deteriorates, we may slow it down a little bit more.",0.6299149,0.945
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,90,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Frank Mitsch,Wells Fargo,"I want to think about the fourth quarter and your implied guidance there because it's looking like it's the lowest EPS ex-CGI that you've done in the last five years. And obviously, volume mix is going to be a big part of that. And so I'm trying to think what the range, I mean your volume mix has been improving throughout the year, it was down 6% Q1, down 5% Q2, down 3% this past quarter. What are you baking in to get to this low level for 4Q?",0.6687543,0.159
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,91,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Frank. I mean part of where we're coming from is we said in the - we always do this to some degree assume the current activity economic and macroeconomically is the basis for our forecast, so obviously moderated through the third quarter. And then we're adding normal seasonality on to that lower base. I mean that's how the forecast got constructed. In addition to that you've got lower capacity utilization, because volumes this year are going to be lower than last year for the second half. So you've got some headwind on asset utilization and that adds to serve some of the decline from third quarter to fourth quarter. But those really are - I mean, there's a little bit of increased competitive pressure on spreads in CI that's part of the story as well, but that's a small part of the story relative to the volume mix and asset utilization.",0.0431948,0.444
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,92,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Frank Mitsch,Wells Fargo,"So I mean, should we be thinking about low single-digits or low double-digits in terms of a decline in volume mix in terms of what's embedded in your guidance?",0.7863605,-0.494
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,93,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I would say Frank as some of the volume mix that you've seen in the last quarter two is kind of what we are expecting. It's really that utilization effect, that really start to hurt our margins in the fourth quarter. And then we'll see how those respond depending on demand environment in 2020.",0.0316173,-0.633
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,94,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Something I'd add on that front is that, what I'd say is what you're seeing is how we're performing in an industrial recession Frank. I don't think there is one in front of us. I think we're already in the middle of one that started in the fourth quarter of last year, where you put a lot of the sort of de-stocking, drop in volume that's where some primary demand, we've already been enduring all of that and some of its continuing in the fourth quarter in the US is starting to slow down. We turned to over high-cost inventory from third quarter of '18 to low cost inventory that's always really painful. A lot of that is now behind us. So all of that's behind us at this point. So you're more a bit about where primary demand goes as you look at next year and - but you're still sort of finishing a lot of that sort of adjustment to recession environment out now. And of course you got all these actions we're going to take. Another reference point is when you look at what we said at Innovation Day in 2014 that our new portfolio would be a lot more resilient and only down sort of 20% if you did the '09 recession. With the current portfolio versus what we had in '09 versus what we were down was 40%, that sort of playing out on a ratio basis now. So if you look at sort of our earnings performance for the first nine months we're about half of sort of the commodity, diversified companies and how we've declined. So the portfolio is performing better. We're obviously not happy about parts of our portfolio and we're going to look at ways to address it, but I think we're doing quite well in this environment.",0.0220049,-0.636
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,95,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Frank Mitsch,Wells Fargo,Alright. That's helpful. Thank you.,0.3333333,0.743
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,98,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So the only other one-time items that I can think that we've talked about this year. One is the unplanned outage, so that you don't expect. And in pension, I already mentioned earlier, where things sit today, pension could be lower. Pension cost should be lower next year versus this year and then currency will be stable. So those are the two or three other major items that I can think of that help next year that are different than they are this year.",0.5508715,0.128
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,99,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But it's important to keep in mind there are a lot of cost reduction actions we've taken are going to sort of annualize and flow into a benefit next year. And if we get volume to be better next year, which I believe we will, that will flow through attractive way with asset utilization.",0.7290139,0.902
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,101,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, sure. So we do have a great track record of managing our free cash flow. What you've seen already, we've generated $525 million of free cash flow through nine months. That's $40 million higher than last year. If you look at fourth quarter last year, we generated $600 million of free cash flow and just in that quarter. Now that did include that $65 million insurance receivable I had mentioned. So it's kind of $535 million excluding that. So I think we're going to generate roughly that same amount of free cash flow in fourth quarter of this year, despite the lower cash earnings and that's primarily as what you had mentioned, we expect higher working capital release, then the $365 million we did last year given the current environment as well as various working capital initiatives we've been implementing throughout the year. And then as you are to see, we're also expecting lower capital expenditures of roughly $10 million to $20 million that helped us achieve this kind of result in this tough environment.",0.2703689,0.977
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,103,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Laurence Alexander,Jefferies,"Hi. Could you flush out the year-end de-stocking or extended shutdowns comments that you've made through the call from a different angle, which is if you look at it more as a cumulative effect spread between Q4 and Q1, what degree of impact are you concerned about? And is it just any auto and industrial customers, or are you concerned about a broader kind of de-stock cycle?",0.7649231,0.0
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,104,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the de-stocking concerns that we have in the fourth quarter are more about normal seasonality then some sort of dramatic de-stocking event. I mean, clearly we've seen significant de-stocking in the first half of this year that goes way beyond where primary demand was at that point, as people are pulling their inventories down, trying to access lower cost raw materials that were available and adjust to an uncertain environment and - but the rate of de-stocking, the amount of it has decreased significantly as you look through the year, even in the third quarter, I would say it was less than the first half, and fourth quarter will have some of that, but not to the degree that we saw in the first half of this year.",0.3671557,-0.052
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,105,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And if I could add a Laurence the area that I'm hearing from our businesses, these are just our customers trying to work to their inventory targets to finish this year and then you get back to that more normal production levels next year. So this is more about a fourth quarter rather than something carrying into the first quarter of next year.",0.5751925,0.0

EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,113,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Duffy Fischer,Barclays,"Good morning, guys. A number of your coatings customers have already gone and there is some cross currents there where they've talked about raw materials moderating and some numbers on demand have been a little bit stronger, a little bit weaker. Can you walk through your coatings raw material portfolio? What do you think the market is doing that you're selling into, and then how are your products faring in that market?",0.7084765,0.414
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,114,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So Duffy, I think our coatings volume situation reflects our downstream customers when we look at just that part of AFP. So I don't see any sort of - on an overall volume point of view, any real differences than what you're hearing from them. The only thing that would be the exception is we did have some very high value additives that go into some automotive coatings into China to predominantly to local OEMs for their cars and that part of the market really is off dramatically. It's probably down 25% year-over-year and so that's been a pretty big sort of mix hit in the overall coating story. But besides that sort of one part of the story everything else is pretty similar and that's why we're not at all worried about. It's a proprietary product. Only, we make and I'm pretty confident Chinese will make cars again and all the EVs that they're expected to produce will be largely made by these local OEMs with these paint lines and be a real benefit for us. It's just a short-term issue.",0.193154,0.971
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,115,Question,2019-10-25,3,2019,Duffy Fischer,Barclays,"Okay, great. And then one for Curt lastly, can you explain to me why pension is a benefit next year, with interest rates dropping so much more this year than we would have expected. One might have thought that actually the discount rate hurts the gap and so that pension costs would start to move up and maybe more cash flow would have to be put into pensions. But can you just walk through that for me?",0.0420962,0.836
EMN-2019-Q3-2019-10-25,116,Answer,2019-10-25,3,2019,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. There is two dynamics there. First is the discount rate and you just need to think about, because we mark-to-market our pension liability that pension liability gets readjusted at end of this year based on that new discount rate and then that discount rate is the determination of your interest cost. So with a lower interest - with a lower discount rate you have lower interest expense on your pension liability next year. And then secondly, last year we had a dramatic decline in our pension assets, because of the fourth quarter performance in our overall market. The assets obviously are performing much better this year. So if you start the year with a better - total amount of pension assets, then you also get assuming the return on those assets. That's another contributor that would help our pension expense on a year-over-year basis. So what I'm talking about pension cost could return to more normal levels like they were in '18 versus the headwind we faced in '19.",0.4365626,0.96

They have just done a phenomenal job through the year of driving growth as all you know we had a bit slow start to the year. And really delivered great acceleration through the year and it was strong volume on a number of fronts. We had great growth that was delivered in the back half of the year in particular both third and fourth quarter from our solar fills as Curt mentioned.

EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,74,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So strong drivers across the market. I would note that coating was more in line with how our customers' grew in that mix. But as we look at 2018 we are confident to continue strong growth in sort of the mid-single digits areas. So it's going to moderate a bit from where we were in 2017.,0.5639772,0.918
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,75,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The key things are this year we don't have that many solar fills so that's going to be a tough comp in the back half of the year, but we will see a return of those solar fills in 2019 and 2020. It's just those orders tend to be chunky and when they fall not just within the year but also across years, it's a great business just chunky.",0.0635697,0.751

EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,78,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Mark J.

EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,80,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So if you think about cash flow again we're expecting greater than 1.1 billion embedded in that is a growth - I'd call modest growth in working capital. If you think about our cash conversion cycle, it should be about the same. I think depend on how you calculate, it's 98, 99 days that will be the same cash conversion cycle in 2018 and just have to kind of input your own thoughts on what you think the rising raw material environment is going to be.",0.1236319,0.772
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,81,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As it relates to the uses of cash flow, you're going to see that same disciplined capital allocation philosophy you have seen this year. So if you think about greater than $1.1 billion, the increase in dividend is roughly going to be a $325 million use of cash. You'll probably see us continue deleveraging about the same level maybe little lower and that we did in 2017. And in absence of any bolt-on acquisitions the rest of it will be deployed to share repurchases.",1.0279692,0.624

EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,85,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I would say that it was an impressive display of supply chain management where we're normally exporting a modest amount of asset in hydride out of this site because we consume most of what we make for our specialty products vast majority. Bringing in a phenomenal amount of acetic acid in the site, it was just extraordinary to see that flow shift in less than 30 days.",0.2796919,0.7

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well you got to keep them, the reason we added back the cost of the instant because first of all we have pretty good line aside of what the additional costs are. And what you have typically is the cost of the incident which is basically supported by the insurance process to go through it is actually reflects the additional cost of procuring and moving the additional raw materials into our facilities versus what it would cost for us to have produced.",0.6752241,0.859
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,90,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well I think if you look at maybe total cost - Mark talked about some cost headwinds, we call it investments. And so what you have there is typically between the three manufacturing sites that we're bringing on stream that will come with about $30 million of its additional fixed cost that we will deal with in 2018 that we will grow into starting at 2018 and going into that 2019 period et cetera.",0.1082286,0.273
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,91,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And just round it out, if you think about that plus we'll have some additional I'll call it roughly $20 million of costs associated with turnarounds that we didn't have in 2017, and plus you got some additional growth and innovation spend et cetera.",0.5987029,0.637
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,92,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So now you think about that, we are using productivities to try to maybe cut half of that gross spend in half and combine that with roughly 70 million of inflation we always have deal with this each year. We will have about $100 million cost reduction program. But in general we'll have a $30 million to $40 million cost headwind related to growth investments to help or support our long-term growth going into 2018.",0.4787191,0.66
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,94,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Curtis E.

We still have a benefit but it will be relatively modest.,0.3806242,0.599
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,97,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So as we said we secured about two thirds of our tow volume in long-term agreements. Obviously there was a third that wasn't and we saw some residual competitive pressure in that space, the price down you saw in the fourth quarter it just the nature of the pricing and the agreements we set for the year. But as you look at 2018, you will see some - sort of more moderate reduction in price associated with some continued competitive conditions throughout the year last year.",2.1193969,0.727
EMN-2017-Q4-2018-02-02,98,Answer,2018-02-02,4,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But as Curt said, those moderate price declines in comparison last year will be more than offset by some of the cost reduction efforts we have to volume being the same. So in general, we feel good about so where it all nets out to being stable for the year with. I think we have a good chance of drive for some very modest growth when you include the innovation program. So really excited to walk you through all of that next week and show how much progress we've made.",0.0350448,0.96

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, so what we said is that the first half is going to be mostly stronger than the second half of the year at the corporate level for EPS. And in particular what we see is - we see actually quite a good strong start to the year as we're going right now so we feel good about the first quarter across the portfolio. But as you look at the back half of the year, you got some sort one-off headwinds in AFP like the solar fills they're not repeating this year compared to the back half of last year and some of this pressure and uses and you know as well as the olefin pressure that we expect in the back half of the year.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,76,Question,2017-10-27,3,2017,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,So I am just wondering as you look across your various segments may be excluding fibers and to lesser extent. Are you seeing underlying trends improve and do you think - I know you have macro sort of as a headwind in the slide deck but do you think we're getting to point where maybe it's not going to be headwind anymore?,0.3457883,0.238

Europe I would describe as solid but not exactly exciting growth. Europe is showing some signs of recovery. Asia is growing a bit faster than the rest of the world and we are seeing some benefits beyond innovation growth which we've been very focused on to benefiting from supply disruptions that's given some additional volume growth especially as the Chinese have enforced environmental law that impacted the competitors that we faced there proving the value of our reliability to our customers, and we're picking up some shares as a result of that. But I wouldn't call that macro.",0.0619397,0.711

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,80,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"First of all the raw material dynamics are quite different in two different segments and the strategies are also a little bit different. So in AFP you've seen a much bigger increase in raw materials that go into that segment and the pricing has been more aggressive in covering those increases. So that's part of the dynamic where the raw materials have been more flattish, with just a slight increase in AM.",0.1552567,0.751
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,81,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So we feel good about the pricing that we're getting in AFP.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,83,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,You have to remember that the interlayer business has annual contracts. So there is no pricing changes in that business once you set those contracts in place from last fall and so we're getting some price up in the poly business as we would expect with the market and making some other choices and some other businesses. So overall we feel good about it and it's on track.,0.0316173,0.112
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,86,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J.

On the hedge, let me just cover '17 and we'll talk about '18 impact. Year to date, the benefit of the commodity hedges rolling off is about $90 million year-over-year that was $30 million in the third quarter. Now keep in mind that benefit is still being offset by a lower commodity -- lower currency hedges not roughly year-to-date $20 million.",1.7778679,0.802
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,90,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So propane stays where it is today. The impact for 2017 over '16 being in that $0.50 to $0.60 set range, but the offsetting impact of lower currency hedges is also little different that's probably now more like $0.15 to $0.20.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,94,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we continue to see very strong volume growth in our premium products.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,95,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And last year was an incredibly strong quarter in Triton for a year-over-year comp.

We see it improving as we go into the fourth quarter.",1.8133659,0.855

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we're very excited about very strong 14% volume growth in the quarter and it really came through a number of factors. First of all, we are seeing good strong volume growth across the segment. I wouldn't call it inventory building at all it just good strong growth.",0.9572127,0.98
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,99,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,There are a few areas where we had exceptionally high growth.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,100,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,103,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So those three were big drivers. We still expect pretty strong volume growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we go to 2018 number of those drivers were moderate that we're driving a lot of the exceptional growth, but we still see a way to deliver mid-single digit volume growth next year as we sort of concentrate and consolidate some of these wins we have this year.",0.1149144,0.938

Now I would note that this is a great example of the strength of our diversity and scale, with the great specialty capability we have in application development and fundamental work we're always doing in cellulosics in AM and AFP, we're able to shift those resources on to this project a couple years ago, few years ago I guess now with the priority to find new applications accelerate growth and it's just amazing to see the progress and a real testament to the strength of having a diverse portfolio.",0.3571139,0.985
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,127,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well Jeff there is a variety of questions in there, but let me try to address of that as best I can. First of all when we think about the nature of the operating costs you need to really think about this kind of three areas of impact. First is just higher operating costs being offset by our business interruption insurance.",0.8662343,0.625
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,128,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,So we do anticipate higher operating cost which is due to a lower utilization rate higher raw material cost et cetera we will be working with our insurance partner but these costs should be generally covered with our business interruption policy after we meet our $75 million deductible. The second bucket of cost is the cost to repair and replace the damage property plant equipment which is going to be also will be working with our insurance partner but should be generally covered by our property insurance after a $5 million deductible.,0.2650993,-0.846
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,129,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,And then finally in the fourth quarter we had to be mindful on the accounting nuances that could be triggered because of this event and some of the impact of utilization rates and reduction of inventories. And so as an example and I kind of kid myself actually to say this but we might have life of decrement because of this event and that may because we're not going to charge in the fourth quarter.,0.4920957,0.0
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,130,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,So again when we put all these various complexities together from a timing standpoint we're still analyzing what's going to get hung up on the balance sheet what close to the income statement et cetera. But our best estimate right now is that will have roughly $100 million cost impact on the fourth quarter and then that we will see that partially offset with an insurance recovery in 2018. And when I think about 2018 I know it will probably be a net positive insurance recovery over cost it's as hard to say whether that will be material number or not as we look at it.,0.1913255,0.827
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,131,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Jeff when it comes to impact on compensation you know as management team we will take the hit for these costs it will be included in our calculations. The thing I would like to focus though and just go back to sort of the story of this event its obviously very serious we take it very seriously and we're going to learn from it but I am just incredibly proud about how the teams have come together to sort of bring this plant back up and incredibly short time frame and make sure that customers are being protected as best we possible can through all this where we're going to have a very limited sales impact.,0.1295844,0.947
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,132,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,When I talked about complex collaboration across the four segments I just want to share a few examples around sort of what we've been doing. The truth is that we have to make her incredibly complicated you can imagine the Atlanta air traffic control systems managing all the needs of all the different airlines we're making in complex our choice is daily and how to balance production and steam and power across 80 operating units that are associated acetyls at our Tennessee site out of the 120 units we have at the site and normal times we are in the site greater than 95% utilization there is just no room for error.,0.1515892,0.34
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,133,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And when you have a massive disruption at the front of the system like a massive storm you need incredible collaboration and unlike the airlines fortunately we're not canceling flights downstream or progress operations it's just a true testament of how we run a complex integrated site. And when we talk about scale and expertise in engineering and construction I want to also highlight a couple examples.,0.8064385,0.807
EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,134,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,At this time we have such scale we can afford to have a state-of-the-art large fabrication facility it's what we call big shop. We lost pipe version in this explosion we built on-site and commission the replacement of it has over a mile of pipe in five days which is just incredible we've drones flying in the damaged facility the day after the incident identifying the damage to equipment within two days of the event we were fabricating in the big shop replacement parts.

EMN-2017-Q3-2017-10-27,135,Answer,2017-10-27,3,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So on top of it moving quickly we have over 500 employees and contractors working on repairing facility looks like an anthill over there. And we can only that because the scale of our site with the flex we can do with resources. We got busloads of mechanics even driving up from Texas pitching and to help on this situation. The other companies just couldn't this they would have go outside engineering support or other people fabrication shops unless they had our scale.,0.5317848,0.839

And in addition of those repairs you know we have backup facilities and hydrate where we bringing those up in record time.

So it's tough to call the exact timing of cash flow at this point on the operational incident, but for fourth quarter we're assuming to be that it will be somewhat neutral as the cash impact of higher operating cost is being offset by further declines in the inventory beyond what we normally do.",0.086745,-0.1

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But if you look at the past three years or back to 2014, we delivered tremendous organic growth and value from our acquisition. If you back out sort of the macro headwinds of oil currency and fibers, you'd see that would be about $10 a share this year which should be 16% CAGR versus 2010 when we started this transformation, as well as 12% CAGR again 2013.",1.1927465,0.807

How you can see the organic growth and the value of the acquisitions in our portfolio, and we are really proud of how we've managed our portfolio aggressively well ahead of the current trend divesting about 3.5 billion of revenue, almost half of it when you go back to - so when we did it and adding some great specialty businesses.",0.6878566,0.93

EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,9,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, David. It's good to hear from you. And we are really excited about Advanced Materials and its ability to deliver pretty substantial earnings growth, as you just mentioned. And I think to talk about it, it's best to start with the context of last year, because it really feeds into why we're so confident about this year. So last year, both at the company level as well, in particular, at the Advanced Materials level, primary demand was incredibly strong at the consumer level. Strong in transportation, B&C durables, a variety of markets, textiles, et cetera.",0.696414,0.988
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,10,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so there -- the constraints in serving it, especially in Advanced Materials wasn't a demand situation. It was a outbound logistics and operational concern, because the demand to come back in such a strong way. We, across the world, of course, ran into supply chain outbound logistics constraints in the industry and we at Eastman had operational constraints. And so, you've got all this primary demand, then you've got the innovation driving the growth to be well above in markets, especially in durables and transportation and textiles -- textiles is fibers.",0.290546,0.855
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,11,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And you've got these operational constraints, right. They were in three buckets. There were plant shutdowns. And in particular, in Advanced Materials, we had a pull forward the line conversion of Tritan because that demand was so strong, we are unable to serve it with existing capacity. So, we had that line conversion that took a bunch of capacity offline during the second quarter of last year.",0.1230644,0.556
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,12,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then we had a long shutdown in the fourth quarter to expand capacity and improve reliability. And bringing that facility -- set of facilities back up online in December took a lot longer than we expected. So, operational constrained demand through last year. So, when you look at this year, from a volume mix point of view, we expect unit have a lot more capacity and we're in a better logistics position to serve all that demand. The innovation will continue to deliver a lot of strong growth on top of that, that allows us to have a big, a very large driver on that front.",0.7184189,0.922
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,13,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to that, of course, with the market being so constrained and tight last year, we had extraordinary inflation across the company and in AM and it really accelerated through the back half of last year in Advanced Materials, in particular. And so, we -- there was a period of time as always that takes prices to catch up to raws.",0.5419723,0.035
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,14,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now on that front, we did a great job of getting all of our prices back up, especially plastics as well as new contracts and interlayers to recover the distribution energy and raw material headwind that we had incurred. And as we look forward, those prices are sufficient to cover raw material and energy costs being somewhere to fourth quarter, and a increasing logistics headwind this year.",1.6263244,0.865
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,15,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, you've got at least $100 million of spread tailwind that is fairly well-defined by the prices we have in place now. So, you put those together, that's very strong growth, but then there's still a cost tailwind as well for this segment. So, when you have all those operational shutdowns, like we did last year, it's not just the higher maintenance costs, the lost volume opportunities, it also led to a very high air freight expense.",0.2697637,0.862
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,16,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"At the company level, air freight was probably $65 million last year relative to a normal 10 and a lot of that was in Advanced Materials. So, our supply chains are in much better shape, where we're not going to incur that air freight this year already have good plan to materially reduce it back to that more normal level, not all the way there, but good progress.",0.4832926,0.899
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,17,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, you've got cost tailwinds to some degree offset by gross spend. But when you put it all together, it adds up to a very impressive earnings outlook for Advanced Materials and you'll see that immediately in the first quarter with strong sequential improvement as that volume and mix improves without the operational constraints, so that fourth quarter which was over $25 million, they're spread expansions, going to occur by those prices that are already in place, as we talked about, and cost will be a bit better.",0.5338223,0.926
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,18,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we feel great about the segment. And it's really a testament to the innovation, right? It's not just about markets. We're growing well above our markets, even in automotive being above the automotive challenges by a significant amount.",0.5831296,0.897
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,20,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, textiles is a great story. As you know, we've been investing in building out a new set of markets with an improved Naia textile fiber. And then we've been able to add sustainability, to this value proposition with not just the biopolymer content that we've had for forever. But now the acetyl component, the other 40% being derived from waste plastic. So, you've got a product that is sustainable -- sustainably grown for us, wood pulp made from waste plastic and certified biodegradable as microfibers, if they get into the ocean through the washing machine, et cetera.",0.2583537,0.794
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,21,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So that value proposition especially for luxury brands, and the women's wear market where sustainability is a very important factor is driving just tremendous growth from that market combined with market recovery from 2020. So, you saw very good revenue in the fiber segment that was driven by this revenue volume mix was relatively stable in tow. And so, the revenue growth is really being driven by the great success we're having in this space. And, it's exciting because we see that continuing, right.",0.3231459,0.976
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,22,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The growth we're seeing in women's wear also starting to get an athleisure is creating a lot of opportunities to grow. In fact, this is like Tritan, where we're moving quickly now to convert more tow lines to making Naia textile fibers to keep up with the growth that we see this year and the years to come. So, it's an exciting story. And obviously, -- and this business, by the way, on the technical side did a nice job of keeping prices to keep up with raws. The spread compression that happened in this segment was really on the tow side.",0.202119,0.95
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,27,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Vince. And we're really excited to get this second project announced. Obviously, we're incredibly excited about the first project we're building that will be online at the end of this year proving out this technology at much larger commercial scale, and enabling very attractive, especially growth here in the short-term. But as we look at the French project, and getting a position in Europe to serve and enable the circular economy, is just an exciting opportunity.",0.2033415,0.962
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,28,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We looked all over Europe and France was a very unique opportunity that we're very excited about. The French government was very committed to be a leader on plastic waste and climate, as you might imagine, and really trying to develop the circular economy. So they were willing to be aggressive on how they're going to improve the recycling infrastructure to support this plant. And they were helpful in making sure we found the right set of incentives, right understanding and very available, green feedstock for the recycling feedstock as well as green energy and steam. So, a lot of factors came together make France very attractive location.",0.0260799,0.969
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,29,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Europe as a market very attractive, especially in France, those brand leaders, especially in the cosmetic luxury space are very forward leaning on sustainability on plastic waste, and dealing with climate. So strong engagement. They wanted to have a plant in their backyard. So once again, good choice in France that allows us to have a very strong competitive position and being a solution provider on the space. So, market demand very strong.",0.6805216,0.964
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,30,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As you saw a number of LOIs in place, one of the milestones that has to be completed, Vincent, is just completing those agreements to lock in both the specialty off take of this plant as well as the PET offtake. And I'll come to textiles in a moment. But it is -- this plan is going to be a mix. So, the first plan is going to be primarily specialties. This plant will be a mix of continuing to have our specialty capability there on our copolyesters as well as making PET for packaging. So, we got to complete those agreements, engagements very strong and make sure that's done.",0.3329258,0.922
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,31,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second thing, of course, is sourcing feedstock. And we're making great progress with a number of suppliers with feedstock. One of the attractive aspects of France is, there's over 600,000 tons of polyester waste a year. And so, tapping into that as well as other countries across Europe. So, we're confident we're going to get the feedstock, but you got to make sure you've completed that sourcing.",0.0448248,0.855
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,32,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then the site selection is the last part, which is we have three very attractive sites identified, they all have very attractive greens -- green energy supply. But we're working through what is the best one with the right logistics for both inbound and outbound, as you're moving a lot of material here, as well as the green energy, which is key to our carbon footprint and our cost structure. And so, we're working through all of that. But I'm very confident, all three sites are attractive, we just need to decide which one. So, we feel good about the track we're on is just completing the work that we are doing.",0.4604727,0.977
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,34,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then on textile, it will be -- yes, on the textile part, Vincent, textiles will be part of it. It's not our primary focus at the moment, because we've had so much engagement in the packaging, in the specialty side. We've been primarily working with customers on that front. So, we're starting engagement on the textile side, right after packaging in plastic waste, the biggest second contributor to incineration landfill is textile waste. So, there is going to be a significant and meaningful circular economy, or that's why we're having so much success in our Naia cellulosic fibers is for the same reason. But we expect textiles to be a part of this project, but I'm not yet sure what percent, so I don't want to get into that at this point. But no doubt it's a source of feedstock, and it's a source of optic.",1.8154034,-0.192
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,39,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Good morning, Jeff. So, obviously, spreads on the Olefin side are the area where we've had the most expansion through last year. And there was a belief at some point, markets will sort of normalize as supply and demand come into more balance. And we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter, and it's held up better-than-expected as you can see in our results. And we expect frankly those spreads to continue to hold up as we go into the first quarter. And then, our forecast is based on moderation starting in the second quarter and becoming more towards normal in the back half of the year, which is as the forecast says, as we all know, right now, Jeff, no one really knows exactly how that spread normalizations is going to occur. But just to be clear, that's what's in our assumptions.",1.6251019,0.625
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,40,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's important to remember that there's other things that go on in the segment that create a lot of value, right. So, we've got very good and volume mix upgrade, especially mix upgrade and the growth we have in ag functional means, and especially plasticizers. And acetyls will actually be up in earnings in a meaningful way this year versus last year. Last year, we had a very large shutdown in our acetyl complex. We're going to have a lot more volume to sell this year and acetic anhydride, because of contractual reasons, didn't improve that much last year. And it's catching up to the better market conditions this year.",1.4551752,0.953
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,41,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, we're going to have a better sort of margins in acetic anhydride, which really is the larger part of our business. You have to remember acetic acid is a small co-product for us. And so, we're not that levered to what's going on in that market. So, we've got a lot of positives going on. Not to mention substantial cost tailwind for this segment when you think about the high shutdown schedule I mentioned in Advanced Materials and how that's a tailwind. That applies across the company and a good portion of that high shutdown -- unusually high shutdown schedule last year was in CI, right.",0.5586797,0.9
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,42,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We delayed a bunch of maintenance turnarounds from 2020 into '21 for safety reasons in keeping people from getting COVID. So, we had a high schedule there. We also had some unplanned outages like Uri, a few other outages in CI in the fourth quarter that were a headwind that will be all become a tailwind. So, you got cost tailwinds, operational cost savings improvements and then you've got these other businesses growing that net against whatever the normalization of CIs on the Olefins spreads.",0.6605542,0.751
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,44,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we definitely are focusing and design these plans with an absolute focus on maintaining steady spreads as much as possible to provide a very reliable source of EBITDA for the company, and margin stability and how it shows up every year. So that's our focus. Now, there are two models and how you do that. The first model is a certain percentage of this plant will continue to be specialties, like what we're doing in Kingsport, there's tremendous amount of demand in cosmetics and electronics and some very sort of unique high value packaging items that are specialty products that we sell everyday now. And we base those prices on value and we have good differentiated positions in the marketplace to maintain prices, relative raw material costs. And so, our pricing strategy for this specialty part of the plant would be what we do every day in Advanced Materials.",0.2000815,0.93
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,45,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition, and a good portion of the volume will be making PET for packaging. And that will be the circular contracting model we talked about at Innovation Day. Brad covered it pretty thoroughly. And those will be take or pay long-term contracts that the prices are based on either the value that we have and providing mechanical recycling content to the marketplace. Remember that current food grade rPET is trading at a 40% to 50% premium to serve virgin PET today and for the last couple years in the European market. And these will be cost faster contracts. So, we're not going to be taking risk on what the feedstock costs are, which makes a lot of sense for the customers because if the feedstock costs go up, the food grade mechanical recycling costs are going to go up even more.",0.1397718,0.823
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,46,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, this is a hedge for them about the risk of buying mechanical recycled content relative to what the cost pass-through contract would provide, which will be relatively more stable. So, those are the kinds of contracts we'd have. So stable margins derived from both parts of the plant. The exact mix of what is going to be specialty versus PET and textiles is still being determined by us, because we are seeing a lot more specialty demand than we originally expected. And so that's good. Those are higher margins. And so, we're working on how to balance all of that out. But whatever we build is going to be flexible. So, the lines that make PET will have the ability to flex and make our specialty copolyesters in the future, so we can always mix upgrade this facilities over time if that opportunity presents itself.",0.002445,0.913
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,50,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. And our absolute focus has been on this question, because I have no intention of getting back into the merchant PET business that had wide swings in profitability. I ran the business for quite some time a number of years ago and not going back there. So, we've been very clear with investors as well as customers that the approach we're taking here is different. And it goes back to what I just said, to Jeff's question, right, the PET part of this business is going to be in long-term offtake contracts with cost pass-through structures where we're not taking spread risk on what the price universes feedstock cost is. That's the only way we're going to build this plant, right.",0.5798696,0.821
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,51,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, those contracts have to get in place, customers are engaged, understand that that's what's in these LOIs that we're getting. And of course, we got to still work through all the details to get to complete agreements, which is when those milestones that Vince asked for a moment ago. But to be clear, we're not going to build the plant unless we get it that way, right. We're not going to get slide back into sort of that [indiscernible] business, that is the normal PET business.",0.0827221,0.751
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,52,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In the specialty, we have a very long demonstrated track record for a few decades now, especially the last decade of delivering very strong volume growth, but also very steady spreads over time. Obviously, there's, like all specialties, sort of expansion, contraction with movements in deflation, or inflation of your raw materials. But we have very differentiated positions, and frankly, those plants are going to give us even more differentiated position, relative to our competitors, because we're going to have recycled content in our products in a plant based in Europe, that gives a much better circular economy benefit for anyone who wants to buy from this plant. The circular economy is a very regional concept. So, when we build plants in Europe, or in the U.S., it's a significant advantage relative to Asian competitors, and how we can sort of provide sort of within region solutions.",3.7575387,0.964
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,57,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, inventories are at historic lows for us. And as far as we can tell with our customers, historic lows for them, too. I should have put that in my string in David's question around Advanced Materials, that's another driver of volume growth on top of good market pent-up demand and the logistics constraints being freed up and innovation driving growth, there is this need to rebuild inventories all the way down the chain, pretty much across every market.",0.1540342,0.936
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,58,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would say the only exception I can think of across all of our markets is tow where the [indiscernible] customers are about normal inventories. But automotive obviously has a huge amount of pent-up demand and need to build re-inventory, building construction, same thing. Durables, where we've seen a lot of growth. There's still a lot of inventory rebuild in that stream. And the list goes on. And that's in AFP as well with coatings and chemicals and care chemicals and animal nutrition. So, another upside that creates a lot of demand that this year will still be pegged against what we can make and ship as we continue to expand capacity to enable more growth next year.",0.4148329,0.922

I would say that, we are exceptionally busy with our top specialty innovation growth programs across the company and ensuring we deliver on that, as well as building out the circular platform, right. We've now got the project in Kingsport, we've got the announcement in France, we're still working on that third project in the U.S and making progress on that. So that is a huge amount of EBITDA in play for long-term growth from the -- from an organic point of view, from -- on the specialty side, accelerated by all this circular opportunity. So, bolt on M&A is a priority. But it's after those two topics.",0.1715566,0.966
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,65,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We do see opportunities in Advanced Materials and AFP. As I've said before, our priorities remain the same around ways to open up new markets with compounding capability in a few targeted areas in specialty plastics, the renewable content of Tritan is opening up new market opportunities in the opaque space and some other more engineer performance dimensions than what we've had in our typical value proposition in electronics and automotive. So, a lot of opportunity there that we want to sort of make sure we can exploit and grow.",0.3810106,0.911
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,66,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're always interested in growing our Performance Films business and have had a great track record of continued bolt on there that should continue. And then whether it's performance, personal care or coating additives, there's -- those opportunities, I'd leverage a very strong position in our technology platforms, in our market positions, that we'll look at. So, those four areas in animal nutrition, right. So, number of different places where we could consider doing it, and the markets are pretty overheated. And we're going to always remain disciplined in our capital deployment to make sure we get an attractive return for investors. So, we'll just have to see, if that gets done. If it doesn't happen as what we said that extra [indiscernible] of cash above the $1 billion this year will turn into share repurchases.",0.0171149,0.98
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,70,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, this -- first of all, we're really excited to have the new focused AFP and its very attractive growth when you look at what we're guiding to a recast $450 million EBIT last year of the AFP business, excluding tires and adhesives. So that is very strong growth. And it really is the same story, just not as extreme as the Advanced Materials earlier, right. So, we've got very good volume mix growth in coatings, in personal care and water treatment, in animal nutrition, and specialty fluids, all of those elements of the market were drivers of growth last year, and are expected to continue to be drivers of growth this year.",0.1198044,0.988
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,71,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This is also a place where we had unusually high shutdown schedule last year, especially for the care solutions business. And so, you've got just that freed up capacity to enable more volume growth on top of market growth as we go into this year. And then you've got restocking because none of these customers have inventory, as I mentioned earlier. So, there's the restocking benefit, and then there's the innovative growth that is continued to gain traction here and starting to sort of build like what we have in Advanced Materials across coatings and care solutions. So that's all contributing. You've got spread improvement.",0.7726161,0.988
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,72,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, this business, increased prices a lot faster last year, because a lot of their positions are in cost pass-through contracts that track pretty quickly with the raws by definition. And -- so those prices increased a lot. So, we didn't have as much of a spread headwind in this business last year as we did in Advanced Materials. Therefore, this year, we're not going to have as much of a tailwind, but we're still going to have a meaningful tailwind. And then, of course, you've got the overall net cost structure being considerably lower this year for the company and AFP will pick up part of that. And then it gets netted off by growth spin.",0.4971475,0.779
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,73,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So well-positioned to deliver growth, and it's really across all the segments. Coatings, residential construction is obviously incredibly tight. Automotive has plenty of room for recovery this year. We've got some actually great growth in semiconductors in the coatings business and animal nutrition is going to have a very good solid year and personal care is a great stable business with more capacity to sell this year.",0.296251,0.972
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,77,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so first of all, we said greater than $100 million. So, we have some room for AR with some -- of the more recent inflation to deliver that $100 million. Second, we have good pricing power in a strong demand environment. We just spent considerable time talking about how our primary demand and our direct customer demand is well in excess of what can be provided, and they need to rebuild inventory on top of that. So, we feel confident in that environment. We have pricing power. And if we see, [indiscernible] inflation go up, we'll increase prices further from where we are today.",0.2110839,0.948
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,78,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But I think the team's done an excellent job. When you look at the raw material inflation really didn't accelerate toward -- until towards the end of August. And by January, we caught up to it. That's actually in the world of specialties actually very good. Excellent as when you think about the extremity of this inflation, we were chasing to be in a very good position for the first quarter.",0.2742461,0.933
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,79,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And to be clear what our assumption is, on a full year basis, this year raw materials and energy are going to be a headwind relative to last year, which is basically assuming those prices remain elevated around fourth quarter. We are also expecting distribution costs to be a headwind this year, as the supply chain intentions are not resolving anytime soon. And the prices we currently have in place get you greater than $100 million tailwind. So, I think we're in a good position. And if oil keeps going up, we will raise prices.",1.3353708,0.786
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,83,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so there's no limitation to our ability to grow the textiles business long-term. So, we definitely have tow assets available to be converted. And obviously, the tool market continues to have sort of a 2% to 3% decline, making additional capacity available. So, it's just time, and CapEx to convert those lines to make the Naia fibers. And we've had some really interesting breakthroughs on the process innovation side to improve our ability to do that in a capital efficient manner. So, we're really excited about that.",0.0619397,0.96
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,84,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we can definitely sort of convert capacity to growth market. And then when it comes to recycled content, for the -- when we look at where we can go in Naia textiles, where we can go in engineered thermoplastics and specialty plastics, where we could go in food service, and which could be significant volume with our biodegradable polymers. We have the ability and the microbeads, which is in very much volume, but very high value. We have plans in place where we can -- with reasonable capital, improve the capability in front of the gasification complex to process whatever plastic waste we need to support all that growth.",0.0228199,0.938
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,86,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We'll have it everywhere. It's really important, just the scale of it will depend on the market and the opportunity that we're pursuing. The -- whatever plastic you get, even if it's ""all polyester"", it's not. When it shows up at the plant gate, there's all kinds of stuff, rocks, aluminum, other polymers that are still in that bale. And you really don't want to put that in the plant. So, to some degree you've got to have this processing on the front to make sure that what you're putting in the front of the plant is as pure polyester as possible. And this is one of the competitive advantage I think that Eastman is going to have versus our competitors. This is a very efficient process we've developed and patented on how to do that.",0.1951915,0.911
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,87,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if you don't have that ability, no matter how good the bale is, that's being delivered to you, you're going to have a serious conversion problem on what's going in the front end to getting high quality output on the back end. One of the great things that, 30 years of experience got us in working with commercial scale plant with Kodak and Eastman is, we learned a lot about how to have high conversion efficiency and how to have high energy efficiency.",0.9731051,0.883
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,88,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so our plant is capable of a 93% conversion on a polyester level from what goes into what comes out, which is incredibly high compared to most technologies. But you still got to make sure it's polyester, you're taking in the front end, so that that mix processing is another competitive advantage that you put together with all of our other advantages that gives us confidence that we can be a leader in this space.",0.1943765,0.908

And I put myself in lockdown for the 2 weeks leading up to it. So, I didn't get omicron and couldn't go so. But he was impressive, actually, I have to say. He was well briefed, detailed conversation that went for a long time with him around what he wants in a circular economy and how we're going to be the largest investment in France this year. And he wanted to make sure that the government's doing everything they can to ensure our success. And so, it was impressive to see him spend that -- a lot of time with me and actually on the detail of making sure we succeed. So, it was good experience. But to the cost question, I will let, Willy, take it.",0.2330888,0.992
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,97,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so it all comes down to sort of why things happen, Frank. But if raws are eroding because supply demand is a little bit more balanced, but demand is still reasonably good, which I think I've covered earlier on our conference and why that will be the case, that becomes a tailwind. So that would be an additional tailwind relative to our forecast.",0.0757946,0.572
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,101,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so the -- so what we don't use goes back into the recycling stream and ends up being used by another recycling process. So, for example, most of what would be leftover, could be used by a pyrolysis plant, there's several of those kinds of projects being developed in France. So, they could take the material and turn it into a circular economy for the Olefin rolled . Worst case scenario, it gets incinerated, like it does today. All this material these days is being incinerated, right.",0.1251019,0.026
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,102,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, you got to keep in mind that the overall recycling industry has a significant need to sort of improve its infrastructure and it's recycling, right. So, France alone has 600,000 tons of polyester waste. Just over half of that is packaging, the rest is textiles and carpets. The textiles and carpets is incinerate has no alternative solution until we show up and the polyester side of carpet and textiles with a solution where it can be recycled.",0.3101059,0.185
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,103,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, on the packaging side, only about 15% to 20% of what is captured by the mechanical recyclers, actually finds its way back into [indiscernible]. The rest of it ends up being down cycled. So, as we sort of optimize this system, we're -- and mechanical recycling feedstock, as we've talked about degrades over time. So, we have to have this molecular recycling technology to close this loop. And it has to be done because plastic is by far the most carbon efficient product versus other materials.",0.3846781,0.438
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,104,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, if we're going to be science driven, that's where this opportunity is so significant for us. But there's a whole ecosystem of recycling infrastructure, Bob, that gets created in this mix plastic processing actually just doesn't just enable polyester for us, but actually enables a cleaner feedstock for other technologies at the same time.",0.3488183,0.64
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,106,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, we're looking at licensing and partnering opportunities because it in itself can really unlock and enable a lot of feedstock recycling infrastructure affordably. So, we're very much looking at that, and how -- as part of how we partner with sort of people who are going to source us feedstocks and other opportunities.",0.0721271,0.785
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,108,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, so it's unfortunately not that simple. A long time ago. DMT is a relatively high-cost way to make the intermediate for making PET. It enables a much higher performing product, which is why we use it in our specialty products. It gives you much better clarity and better performance on any dimension. So, we are DMT based as a competitive advantage for specialties. But the existing PET infrastructure that's in Europe, and really across the world for that matter is based on PTA. And so, you can't just swap out deep PTA and use DMT in an existing PET plant, you'd have to spend a significant amount of capital to convert the facility. And once you start looking at that capital conversion cost, you might as well just build a new plant. It's more -- it's a better integrated return.",0.3818256,0.944
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,113,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"No, it's a very good question when we spent a lot of time on. And as we look at the Naia token version as well as before you get to tow, the ability to redeploy flake, the intermediate, the polymer, basically it goes into the spinning lines, into food service and into thermoplastics, creates different ways to sort of redeploy the entire integrated stream and create very tight stream relative to where it is today. But, yes, there are ways to look at converting capacity on the tow front. There's also new technologies and next generation technology we're working at, and I'm not going to go into detail now, that would be a different way to make the fiber at a much more capital efficient and advantaged greenhouse way.",0.0582722,0.941
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,114,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we're pursuing all those options. And whether it makes the total tow industry, exceptionally tight isn't just about us, right? It's also about what happens with our competitors, and what they do with their capacity. And we're very fortunate to have a long multi decade history of innovation in cellulosics to all these different specialty applications, that allow us to create all these new opportunities for growth, that allow us to keep our stream tight and grow it when you include the specialties with the fiber complex.",0.0476773,0.931
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,115,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But the -- it's not as clear that everyone else can do the same thing. And so, I hesitate to say that, the industry in total is going to become extremely tight. But I will tell you with the capacity reductions that have already happened to the tow industry over the last several years and we're doing certainly tightening the market in a meaningful way.",0.3121434,-0.058
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,117,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, day one this quarter relative to the fourth quarter, you're going to see substantial spread expansion with the prices that we've put in place relative to Q4. That's a big driver of the not just annual outlook for Advanced Materials, but the strong improvement we're guiding to you about Advanced Materials on a Q4 to Q1 basis. Combined with the volume and mix growth, it really is a big substantial step up from where we were in the fourth quarter. So, yes, it's going to start happening right now. It picks up momentum though.",0.2449063,0.973
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,118,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the expansion gets more significant in the second, third and fourth quarter, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis for where all the value comes from, not just on spread, but also in volume mix improvement. We were really constrained because we're normally seasonally stronger in the second quarter in volume mix. Last year, we couldn't do that, because of the shutdown that we had to do due to the Tritan conversion. So, a lot better ability to grow volume in the second quarter as well as spread improvement. So, AM will actually have a very good second quarter relative to the first quarter when you put that together. So, now it's happening now.",0.0501222,0.98
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,122,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, there's really not much operational risk in the mix processing part of cleaning up the feedstock before the plant, and it's very low capital in the way to do it. So, we've already -- are constructing the facility here for sort of 110 KMT of inbound feedstock to this facility and the same larger scale facility will be built in in Europe. What's interesting is it's modular. So, as we look at this, there's an opportunity to actually do it in multiple locations, to be more logistically efficient and how we source waste and collaborate with sourcing partners. So, we're still debating on how much we do it on site versus closer to where the feedstock is being sourced to get a more streamlined stream moving across the road to us. So, there are definitely some design options there with our sourcing partners or feedstock sources, and how we're trying to take that through.",0.0546047,0.871
EMN-2021-Q3-2022-01-28,124,Answer,2022-01-28,3,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the -- our cost structures, we're not going to sort of get into debating and discussing sort of detail cost structures. But what I can say is that, when we look at our cost structure and the pricing, which is being centered around the alternative material, which is mechanical recycled content, we are in a very good position to have spreads that will then be sort of locked in, in cost pass-through contracts to deliver a greater than 12% return.",0.0289324,0.69

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The -- from a premium point of view, when you think about the quality of mechanical recycle versus our molecular recycled product, our product is much higher quality. Because the nature of unzipping the polymer and purifying it allows us to then have identical intermediates to what we use today from fossil fuels. So, the products we make, both specialty as well as PET will literally be identical, no compromise, right.

So, on the inventory restocking question, presuming we've got a growing economy this year, around the world, I think the world is going to struggle to keep up with demand. So, it's hard to see that anytime soon we're going to -- the customers or Eastman for that matter are going to get inventories back to where they should be for more stable level of performance.

And it's amazing to see how sustainability has changed the mindset around these products, right. They've always sold on performance, they've never sold on sustainability until 3 years ago.

And as I said earlier, we are confident in the technology, we've been operating now for quite some time, and has been processing plastic wastes really well. There are reasonable capital ways to sort of expand that capacity and grow with all these markets. And the margins in our cellulosics are some of if not the highest margins in the company.

We're really excited about our strategy to grow the company, believe in the specialty model, the circular platform, the strength of our cash, we think these are all differentiators. But what's incredibly important for me to mention and highlight right now is I couldn't be on this call talking about all of this, if it wasn't for the employees we have around the world.

So, I just want to thank all of them, because with COVID and constraints in the work environment, and in particular, I want to thank the operators out there because they go into the plant every day since COVID started, managing in a very difficult operating environment while having to wear a mask and follow the safety protocols.

Our focus on innovation has resulted in repurposing some of our acetate tow manufacturing lines to textiles and non-wovens, which are no longer needed for tow and which has led to increased capacity utilization that improves our cost position to serve our tow customers.

We remain on track to deliver a solid year in cash generation and disciplined capital allocation in 2018. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2018 totaled $381 million, excluding insurance proceeds.

Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Through the first nine months, we've returned $615 million, split between $240 million in dividends and $375 million in share repurchases.

We have previously indicated we expect the final net impact of the incident to be between $25 million and $50 million. With the final insurance settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2018, the net impact was approximately $25 million. And the negative cash flow impact in 2018 is expected to be at a similar level. I really appreciate the efforts of the Eastman team to help minimize the financial impact of last year's incident. Well done.",0.1175517,0.475

For the first nine months of 2018, we delivered strong volume growth and mix improvement in our specialty segments, but were two times the growth in the underlying markets. We're continuing to benefit from innovation driven growth model. We're making great progress on new business revenue closures, which is up 20% through the first nine months and we expect to continue creating our own growth in the many applications across the company through innovation enabling us to grow faster than the underlying markets.",0.7017115,0.991

And as I mentioned in my first slide, we returned $615 million to our stockholders through the first nine months, including accelerating our share repurchase program. Lastly, we have improved our effective tax rate. At the same time, while we focus on what we can control, we're managing a number of headwinds. We're seeing some pockets of destocking, but no evidence of a broader slowdown, with the exception of autos in China.",1.5146699,0.262

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We've also seen higher raw material and energy prices, although these are volatile as we've seen over the last several days and we have some limited exposure to trade disputes, particularly in fibers. Taking all this together, we expect that the EPS growth will remain at the 10% to 14% range and will likely be towards the bottom of that range. And as Kurt mentioned, we have a path to deliver over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is one of the strongest in the industry and reflects our outstanding performance, especially in this inflationary environment.",0.8549307,0.898

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On slide 12, let me make a few comments about our expectations for 2019 and summarize where we are. As we look at 2019, we have a couple of high level assumptions. Economic growth is similar to '18, raw material and energy prices are fairly stable and the US dollar does not strengthen meaningfully from the second half of 2018. In this context, we expect continued growth in volume and mix upgrade, which has been powerful for the last five years. In particular, we'll continue to create our own growth through our innovation driven growth model.",0.9466178,0.953
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,49,Remarks,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We expect to benefit from the absence of significant operational headwinds, including unplanned vendor outages and higher than normal plant shutdowns. We also don't have another large step-up in growth cost next year. With our expected growth and fixed cost leverage, we will convert our variable margin to the bottom line much more effectively than this year, providing an attractive return on these investments, as we move forward. And we expect to benefit from our GP investment, lowering our merchant sales in ethylene relative to 2018. With more stable raw material prices, we will not be chasing raw materials with price increases through the year in the specialties.",0.790546,0.956
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,50,Remarks,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On a segment level, we expect to see sustainable earnings growth in the specialties due to the volume growth and fixed cost leverage, along with stability in fibers and CI, which is consistent with what we've shared with you at Innovation Day. And discipline allocation of our strong free cash also contributes to EPS growth. As a result, we expect EPS growth to be in the 8% to 12% long term range we communicated at Innovation Day. We'll talk more about our outlook for 2019 on our call in January when we have more insight into the macroeconomic conditions.",0.3251834,0.971
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,51,Remarks,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Finally, let me summarize where we are and why I'm so confident about our future. As you think about our portfolio, we're showing progress in our goal of driving from 70% to 80% of our business in specialties, which is especially important in the face of uncertain macroeconomic trends. All this comes together for a terrific bottom line. We can grow faster than the underlying markets and sustain our margin through our unique innovation driven growth model. We also do this through the scale and integration, which gives us a competitive advantage in how we develop new products and bring them to market. And finally through disciplined portfolio management that leads you to one of the strongest free cash flows in the industry, a strong return on invested capital that is growing and compelling compounded EPS growth through 2020 and beyond. When we put it all together, we're well positioned for long term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our shareholders and all of our other stakeholders.",1.6108394,0.991

EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,56,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, David. So, we're making great progress on that front already through the third and fourth quarter. AFP has had six consecutive quarters of price increases, making good progress on that and we expect that as we work through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we should be in a good position to get our prices to catch up. I mean, the fourth quarter includes normal seasonality and destocking as we've mentioned. So, we'll get some of it then, but the remainder in the first quarter.",0.6312143,0.812
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,58,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So it starts with, you should assume that our free cash flow will grow, because we're doing a great job, converting net earnings to cash flow. We'll be assessing how much de-leveraging. I think our de-leveraging will decline, in part, that will determine based on how much EBITDA growth we expect next year. So if you think about cash flow deployment, it's going to be first to pay that nice dividend that we have, which is yielding even better than it was a month ago. Secondly, it will be doing some continuing leveraging, but less than what we did this year and in absence of bolt-ons, it will be deployed for share repurchases.",0.2634779,0.874
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,61,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Vince. So right now, it's always hard to know exactly what's going on, especially at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We certainly see some destocking in coatings and tires as you noted that is associated with the auto industry. We are anticipating that there's some potential de-stocking that could be driven by trade concerns in China about our customers' ability to export back to the US, which would be more sort of specialty plastics, consumer durable oriented. But I'd tell you right now, orders are holding up relatively well in October across the specialties. So, outside of autos, where we can see some de-stocking, it's more about anticipation of these issues more than things we see at the moment.",0.2583537,0.812
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,63,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"What you see in the other net just in the third quarter is we did our settlement with our insurance provider for the coal gas incident. That created a $65 million receivable at the end of September, which we've not collected in October. Another way to think about it, as you think about our seasonality of cash flows, as I mentioned, the net impact is going to be roughly $25 million on cash this year. So if you assume that $65 million benefit in fourth quarter, that means our cash flows have been hurt mostly this year and a good part of that was in the third quarter. So that's what you're seeing is the seasonality of cash flows, but that specific item that you're seeing in other is a $65 million insurance receivable at the end of September.",0.0778273,0.307
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,65,Question,2018-10-26,3,2018,Frank Mitsch,Wells Fargo,"Following up on the destocking question, I believe you said the pace of business in October was holding up well and kind of your guidance is anticipation of these issues, are you meaning to say that you're leaving yourself some wiggle room in terms of the guidance of the various segments or you have pretty clear line of sight that come November, come December, you're going to be hit with these issues.",0.2543493,0.807
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,66,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, Frank, I think that any fourth quarter is a tough one to predict. There's always a certain amount of seasonal decline due to normal de-stocking and demand trends. Obviously, we're in a much more volatile time right now when you see what everyone else is saying around the industry. I think our guidance is pretty good. It does include some anticipation. When you think about the fourth quarter, you've got a couple of factors. One is the de-stocking issue as we've identified and it's our best estimation.",0.4127954,0.917
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,67,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You've also got raw materials, prices still chasing raw materials I'd say and AM, we feel good, we've implemented some price increases in October that have gone quite well to start catching up to PX. And so I think we're making really good progress there to get to where we need to be by the first quarter with where we think PX prices are going to sort of trend off. And in AFP, we're still doing the same thing, which is managing our price relative to rise, with the exception of adhesives, where we have been talking about a known coming challenge for quite some time.",0.0158924,0.89
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,68,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So when you put those two things together and you've got a bit of a tough comp as well, when you think about the fourth quarter, we have some higher shutdown costs, you have some of those solar fills that were really strong in the third quarter of AFP. It was also about a third of them were in the fourth quarter. So there's a lot of things we're trying to balance in that guidance. But we still feel it's a very good fourth quarter.",1.0268949,0.812

To what extent and you outlined what your thoughts were in 2019, but - and you've been accelerating your repurchase here in 2018 versus your original guidance there. What should we be expecting, given the decline here in Q4?",0.4613779,0.586
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,70,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Welcome back, Frank. As it relates to the share repurchases, we're going to be disciplined with our capital allocation and we're going to complete utilizing $300 million of free cash flow to de-lever. So, you can do the math off of our 1.1 billion to determine kind of roughly how much share purchases we'll be doing this quarter and I can assure you what the discipline that our treasury team executes, we've been in the market with 10b5-1 plan. So, we've been in the market all year. We're going to be in the market in the fourth quarter and I can assure you, we're going to be in market next year as we continue to repurchase share as part of our disciplined capital allocation philosophy.",1.2075395,0.948
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,73,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, there are two different sides of this story as we've discussed in the past. The -- first of all, we're very happy about advanced materials and the strong progress that's having, delivering very strong growth, relative to the underlying markets across the whole business. So the top line has been great, the mix upgrade has been great. Within the third quarter, PX prices moved up pretty dramatically within the quarter and most of that's clearly pricing. So, you couldn't really take action on that dynamic until you got to October 1, which we did and we've introduced a price increase that should cover most of that PX increase, as we work through the fourth quarter.",0.6173594,0.991
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,74,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if you look at our history on that side of things and all of our copolyester related products, I think we've actually managed price to rise fairly well. As we said in the last call, on the interlayers business, we have had an intentional strategy of sharing some of the scale up of our high end specialties, heads up display, and acoustics. As we ramp those products out, get more cost efficiency in how we make them, we've shared some pricing on that with them to support their growth, which has been exceptionally strong and we have very high double digit growth in heads up display, strong growth continues in acoustics that drives a significant amount of earnings increase on the mix side that is far more valuable than the modest price declines we've been sharing with them, as we gain efficiency on the fixed cost leverage.",0.0476773,0.991
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,75,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So net, there are two different stories and strategies there, both of them working incredibly well and I think we're on track to deliver good growth. It's important to remember that it's not just price to rise as part of the story in the third quarter and the fourth, is the growth investments we've made in this segment, which in the third quarter was around $10 million higher growth costs than 2017. So when you sort of think about those two factors put together, it was actually very strong results for AM.",1.2306438,0.948
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,77,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, no change in our philosophy, PJ. We've been looking primarily at bolt-on acquisitions. There's things in the pipeline, we're going to continue to be disciplined, as we go through that process, who knows maybe some of this market volatility will create some closure in bid ask spreads that we're encountering in some of our activity out there. So again nothing eminent right now on the bolt-on acquisition front and we're going to remain patient and a disciplined buyer.",0.0429672,-0.101
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,78,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I would just add that on the large M&A question, we're actually quite happy with the portfolio we have. I think we're well ahead of the industry in being very disciplined in portfolio management. As you all know, we divested a lot of commodity businesses, 3.5 billion in revenue and we did some substantial acquisitions with solution Taminco and a few bolt-ons that got us over 4 billion in revenue, dramatically improving the structural quality of our EBIT margins as well as improving the stability and ability to create our own growth in times like this where economics -- the macro economy is a little less certain.",0.1026895,0.978
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,79,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we feel like we've done what we need to do in improving the quality of our portfolio. We're not looking for large M&A at this stage, because we've done the transformation we need, we're not just focused on bolt-on that as Curt said, much more importantly, our growth model is really paying off every day. We're driving a lot of innovation and growth across AM and AFP where we create our own growth and want to make sure we get a good return on investment for these acquisitions, which are a lot of the growth that we're delivering through the revenue synergies with them.",1.3496333,0.977
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,81,Question,2018-10-26,3,2018,Robert Koort,Goldman Sachs,I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more detail around the tires margin [indiscernible]. It does seem like maybe some of the tire manufacturers and a few other chemical companies in that space have sounded a little bit more somber. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing on sell-through you think there versus maybe the destocking issue that you talked about?,0.1893764,-0.085
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,82,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, Bob, it's good to hear from you. So, we see the primary demand situation in tires similar, which is it's relatively slow. It's important to keep in mind that tire sales are also about 75% replacement. So, they're relatively stable as well when you think about it over time in macroeconomic uncertainty, but that market isn't growing that fast. We've been benefiting from a lot of growth above market on things like our tire resins and making sure we're aligned with the right customers in China who are doing more of the consolidating of the other tire companies and picking up some growth from that. More importantly, we are in a great position right now with launching our new Cure Pro product from our new Crystex technology into the marketplace.",0.0012225,0.979
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,83,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's being very well received and to bring significantly better performance in the products that are currently on the market, including our own by helping tire companies improve mixing efficiency anywhere from 15% to 20 plus percent. So right now, when you're trying to manage costs and be very efficient in our customer base, this is a highly valuable product and we expect to see good growth from leveraging that fixed cost that we have as a headwind this year, turning that into leverage earnings growth next year, but yeah, the overall market is going slow. We don't see it any differently. I would note we're more connected to commercial tires and commercial demand, so that's actually been quite attractive, especially in North America.",0.9201304,0.959
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,84,Question,2018-10-26,3,2018,Robert Koort,Goldman Sachs,"And then shifting over to the [indiscernible] business, have you noticed -- there's been some puts and takes around demand trends I guess in active ingredients and what's going on there. Has that business been relatively stable or what's sort of the outlook in the crop chemical part of that business?",0.2967667,0.527
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,85,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the business has been stable. There's always been continued regulation in Europe around components of crop protection products or products in total and we continue to have some degree of restrictions on some of those products we have had in Europe, but it's just more of the same. That's been going on for several years. I wouldn't call it anything particularly new. I do -- have some upside that I think we didn't have when we bought Taminco as we've worked to help them have a more global reach in their commercial execution capabilities, we've been able to help them create a lot more growth from products like their growth regular products in Canada and North America by bringing a better global reach to that business.

So, the very significant capital investment, which is why the growth headwinds this year are material relative to last year.

EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,93,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, first of all, we're not trying to predict when the trade issue gets resolved. That's at a better much higher level than my pay grade. But what we're saying is, like all companies, there are mitigating actions you can take to sort of minimize your exposure to some of these trade issues. We're a multinational company, we have assets around the world, not just in the US. And so, we have options we can work on to mitigate that exposure in fibers and in other products as well.",0.3838631,0.863
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,95,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So, we continue to sort of do grade work in mitigating our exposure to the ethylene market. As we mentioned in the last call, there are two different things we're doing. So for the back half of this year, we've significantly reduced the amount of ethylene we're selling by reconfiguring how we run our crackers, the shutdowns that we had, in particular, the unplanned shutdown that we're forced in to buy our industrial gas supplier in the second quarter allowed us to accumulate quite a bit of propylene in inventory. So that allows us to run our crackers in a different way in the back half of this year, minimizing ethylene production that comes out of bit less propylene and storing a bit of ethylene.",0.206194,-0.178
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,96,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so that takes us pretty much out of the ethylene market for the back half of this year. That's not sustainable, which is why we're making the RGP investment to dramatically reconfigure our cracker and give it more flexibility to reduce the amount of ethylene we're producing. So as you look at next year, and how this investment will allow us to operate, we can reduce our ethylene production by about 80%, relative to normal and that allows us to significantly reduce our exposure there.",0.5162999,0.778
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,97,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The RGP investment also produces more propylene from the production process as well as reducing the ethylene and then the feed slate changes pretty significantly in how we're feeding our crackers. So, our propane purchases drop in half. Our ethane purchases are about 20% less, we're buying about 150,000 tons of RGP to get this result. And so what we've done is shift significantly our propylene to propane spread volatility towards PGP to RGP, which is much more stable if you look at history and allows us to significantly reduce our olefin volatility exposure in next year and retain flexibility, if it gets very attractive, we can switch back and take advantage of that. And this is $20 million investment with a payback less than -- in less than a year, so it's just a great investment opportunity for us.",0.5460473,0.961

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So Jeff, on the SG&A, I think maybe the way I'd answer that is let me just talk about growth investment. We are seeing growth investments during the course of this year. You see that in SG&A and R&D. That's all a part of our plan of building capabilities, particularly application development activities. So over time, you actually should expect SG&A and R&D to increase kind of throughout the year.",0.2715849,0.758

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Quarter to quarter, there can be variables that change SG&A, you saw some of that in the third quarter. I'd also say that with the current economic environment, maybe we tightened up our SG&A a little bit more in the third quarter. So you should see SG&A growing over time, third quarter was just some variability and let me just close out with a remainder, so our SG&A and R&D is still one of the lowest in the industry as a percentage of sales.",0.2209161,-0.226
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,103,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Part of what I like about our strategy and our continued discipline about protecting shareholder value is how we make sure we're getting a good return on every dollar, not just in the SG&A, on the R&D. We have made tremendous success in repurposing or refocusing the R&D resources. So within our spend, we've doubled the amount of people working on application development, reducing what we're working on on some process elements that weren't as critical in creating value for shareholders. And so I think, we have a great track record of being disciplined, but overall for the year, you're still going to see about a $50 million headwind in growth costs on a full year basis, 30 plus of that is in the manufacturing cost and about 20 in the SG&A and R&D, but we do have some productivity offsetting the net spend that you're going to see show up on the P&L.",0.2546862,0.919

So about half of the 14% volume growth rate last year was the solar performance. So when you think about that and back that out of the results we have this year, you're talking sort of 8% volume growth year-over-year in AFP and everything else. So, it's a strong story of continued growth in that business.",0.2583537,0.885

So, as I said in the prepared remarks, the specialty businesses, which is 70% of earnings and we're driving to be a higher percentage of our earnings will continue to be the horses that drive forward and build our earnings growth next year. So, we will continue to see a good growth in AFP and strong in AM. And, I think fibers will stabilize, CI with the investments we're making RGP, have the opportunity to be a little bit better next year than this year, but I think it's way early to call any of these items.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I'd also sort of remind you not to overly focus on the back half of this year on some of the dynamics that sort of feed into how we go towards next year. You've got a lot of de-stocking going on, as we expect some of that in pockets in AFP and maybe a little bit in AM. You've got prices catching up direct, through the back half of this year and some of these isolated trade issues around fibers that on a full year basis next year really isn't much headwind, because now it's China tow is just so small.",0.2273839,-0.052

So overall, we feel like we're in a really good position to drive volume growth in the specialties, leverage all the fixed cost investments that we've made and generate a lot of free cash flow and even on the price front, to rise if stabilize as I expect they will, given the environment we're in, that doesn't become the headwind or chasing all year like, we did this year and that's not a drag next year.",0.7550937,0.939

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, in fibers growth and repurposing this business to become a specialty business again is just a great story and we're really excited about it. The key markets are textiles and non-wovens and we have a real opportunity here with the change in sustainability and environmental trends about products that are certainly more environmentally friendly, so the timing couldn't be better for us to take advantage of that trend.

So for the fashion history, especially the millennials who are driving a lot of these decisions today, this is very exciting to them and I was just at the largest textile show in Paris a couple of weeks ago in a meeting with both textile mills and brands and it was just amazing to see how excited they were about this story and it all focused on sustainability and how we can sort of help them improve their position in the marketplace with it.",0.1214344,0.975

So, 30% growth rate, even though it's a small part of the overall fibers business today and we're making great progress. Now, it's up to about 15% of the segment revenue and the margins are good.

I mean, the value proposition we've had historically and continues in consumer durables and some medical applications is high clarity parts very strong, high strength through requirement, chemical resistant requirements, and BPA free and that's been a core part of it. But the story we told you today has actually opened up an entirely new space that is more about compounding Tritan into opaque applications. Obviously, that's not been our historical footprint, but we're now expanding into opening up that entire market to us as well through Tritan and our new Treva, so, those plastic launch. So the housing is replacing all opaque.

It's a relative growth rate issue, but the reality is to drive overall earnings growth, as we push forward, it's possible because you have, Tel is only going down 2% a year at this stage going forward and you've got 30% growth or 20% growth in certain applications. The math is still going to work to get you sort of net earnings growth on this, which is why we're repurposing this capacity to support this growth as we go forward.

One seems to be that apart from some soft areas of de-stocking, demand is overall okay and the other part is that the portfolio is more resilient. Are you implying that, even given what we've already seen in terms of -- or what you're seeing with customer conversations, we would have seen in the back half of the year, more lumpiness without the efforts you've made in the last few years or do you think it's more just that demand is actually fairly benign and that we haven't really stress tested the new portfolio mix.",0.0476923,-0.571

If you remember, fourth quarter of last year, we generated $435 million of free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we're going to have an insurance payment that we've already received as well as we're going to have $50 million of lower CapEx. So in order to achieve our $1.1 billion of free cash flow, we are only needing some 60 million plus of additional free cash flow generation over last year and those are the types of working capital dynamics that we're working through.",0.1706526,0.935
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,124,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As you think about the conversion next year, I think we'll still have strong conversion of earnings next year. We might have CapEx, maybe a little less than it is this year. We won't have the net $25 million headwind, the insurance and then it's going to come down to how well working capital evolves, if you assume working capital, raw material cost normalize, that means you won't have the working capital challenges that you've had this year. So I see a path where we're going to continue to have good conversion. I don't see that conversion rate coming down.",0.0571544,0.823
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,125,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the second question, sequentially, I think it's probably better to go at it, because the '17 compares are tough in some of the businesses, especially AFP and fibers. But the trends we see sequentially in demand are relatively stable. So, we continue to see solid growth in the specialties. You're always going to see normal seasonality, as you go into the fourth quarter. And then at the AM level, clearly, we had strong volume growth in AFP when you adjust for the solar fills, you had strong volume growth. I think in chemical intermediates, there's always a certain amount of volatility. We saw some demand come off in the third quarter, some of that, which is seasonal in ag and a few others shut down dynamics of customers.",0.1259169,0.97
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,126,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Nothing's sort of concerning. But as you sort of go into the fourth quarter, with this inflationary raw material environment that we've been in through the third quarter, it's natural to expect de-stocking, especially in places where demand has moderated a bit like the transportation sector, as we've highlighted in sort of coatings and tires or some trade related caution there. So, I think it's really important we don't overreact to what's going on in the fourth quarter right now. From what we see, it appears to be mostly de-stocking. It's always hard to know exactly what's going on with the primary demand, especially in a fourth quarter when there is normal de-stocking anyway.",0.091687,0.401
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,127,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so, we're not in a position where we're sitting there, saying that we see a primary demand problem out there and the marketplace is outside of the obvious sort of stuff going on in autos. And it's really important to remind you all about autos in Eastman in the way it works. Overall, we've said our exposure in transportation is about half OEM half sort of refinish replacement. But it's important to break that down in a couple of ways. First is, on the AM side, it is much more OEM related, but that is where we have so many innovative products and interlayers like heads-up display and acoustics as well as paint protection films, allowing us to grow much faster than the underlying market, which we demonstrated already in the third quarter and expect that to continue into the fourth.",0.4722901,0.88
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,128,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then on the AFP side, about two thirds of that business is more sort of refinish replacement, when you think about tires and where our projects are going into automotive coatings. So, quite a bit of stability in those kind of markets in this kind of timeframe. And even within these markets, we target different applications. So, for example, in China, while the overall auto sales are down, we're actually seeing good growth, because we're more aligned with luxury cars than the smaller cars that don't have the tax incentives anymore and so we're still seeing good growth in our performance films business and some of our high value interlayers that go into the more luxury cars that are actually still growing in China. So, we have to be very careful not to sort of apply a broad brush on some of these things to make sure you understand. I think we're in a pretty solid position.",0.2082315,0.97
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,131,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. That's just the seasonality of the effective tax rate. Earlier this year, we thought we'd be in the 18% to 20% range, due to -- as we continue to evaluate the various moving parts of our effective tax rate, it actually improved to 17% for the year. What you see in the third quarter is just a catch up to that 17% rate on a year-to-date basis. But for the full year of '18, it will be around 17% and I can assure you we're working towards that rate next year.",0.4515606,0.919
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,133,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, no, when I think about 2018, there are some moving parts between EBIT and tax rate. So some of our year-over-year growth this year is improvement in tax rate, a little bit better than we thought last year. But when you go in to '19, the tax rate should not be a headwind or a tailwind and it's all around underlying performance of the business that Mark already talked about.",1.2918525,0.694

EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,136,Question,2018-10-26,3,2018,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,"I just wanted to come back to the capital expenditure profile. It seems to me you've completed quite a few projects over the last 18 months. Tritan most notably, but Crystex and other product lines. As I listen to Curt's comments about CapEx, it seems like you could trend down slightly in 2019. So is it the case that you've got enough capacity across the portfolio at this point or are there other prospective growth projects that you plan to layer in over the next several quarters?",0.3569292,0.768
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,137,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I think, Kevin, your intuition is correct. We do expect slightly lower capital expenditures in 2019 versus '18. Part of that is, keep in mind, some of the capital expenditures were for the coal gas recovery. So when you think about maintenance CapEx, it's in that 300 million and 350 million. We showed at the Innovation Day, it could be anywhere from 500 million to 600 million going to '19, and probably be more towards that low end of that range.",0.3713012,-0.171
EMN-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,138,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I think it also connects back to sort of the fixed cost leverage comment. As you think about next year, under the assumption the world's growing, we'll have continued variable margin growth next year and a very different fixed cost situation where this year if you think about between the 50 million of growth investment costs and if you look at the sort of planned and unplanned operational headwinds we had this year, there's another 50 million. So you've got $100 million of headwind against variable margin and growing EBIT in '18 versus '17. And if you think about how that translates to '19, some of that annualize, so and that is down to sort of $75 million of tailwind, if you will of variable margins growing and how you have much less headwind in '19 to '18. So, there's considerable leverage here, which feeds into our view about how we can continue growing earnings into '19, as we don't have another step up of these costs.",0.1687042,0.881

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,13,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now some of that strength in volume and mixed growth was offset by sort of temporary -- temporarily high sort of distribution costs and some of the other supply chain factors that we faced in the second quarter and expect those to abate.

In your commodity business, you earned $144 million and I think last year you earned $22 million. Can you analyze the year-over-year change in that operation? And I think sometimes you talk about intermediates, plasticizers, functional amines as being the larger chunks of it. How did those subsegments do your every year? Can you talk about the dynamics here?",0.5615322,0.934
EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,58,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Jeff.

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,60,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J.

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,61,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And they've got a few accelerants on top of that beyond just the normal ag growth. So we've got a plant that we just built and are ramping up for Corteva for their Enlist product that's giving us a lot more additional growth on top of that core business. So that's just been a nice great steady business.,1.0615322,0.948
EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,62,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Then the -- then you do have plasticizers, which has been a very attractive business. We've been a leader in non-phthalate plasticizers for a long time and so we get not just underlying market growth but above market growth in that business as we've been replacing other plasticizers.

So, we have a lot of that business on cost pass-through contracts versus spot, because we want predictable earnings that really show a lot of benefit and how well CI held up on an annual basis in 2019 and 2020 relative to 2018.

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,75,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So, if we look at July, what I'd say Frank is, prices have held up similar in July to the second quarter. But propane costs are trending higher, right?

It looks like the guide is more heavily weighted on the third quarter. Is that more a function of that you have greater near-term visibility?

You've talked about the key opportunity on a take or pay basis. I am wondering like in polyester fibers, if there's an avenue into the apparel industry or textile industry. I mean, I know you obviously have Naia through the fibers but that's a different solution.

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,90,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So there's two different opportunities for this, Vincent, and good to hear from you, in the textile world. First and foremost, we're having tremendous success with our biopolymer, right? So you've got to remember, we have a cellulosic polymer called Naia that is half biopolymer from a certified sustainable force and the other half now is going to have recycled content in it through our recycling technology and it's -- as a microfiber, it's certified as biodegradable.",1.0814996,0.953
EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,91,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So it's the hat-trick of solving the environmental problems that are out there and we see really strong engagement from customers on that. It's a nice high margin product for us and in a way to sort of repurpose all of the fibers capacity that was making tow. So we spent a lot of time driving that and it's just a great success story.,0.9739201,0.863
EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,92,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J.

Mark, with regard to your specialty segments, margins came down a bit on a sequential basis.

So it's not just price -- per unit delivered, but it's mode that we had to use to keep our customer supplied. So there just was a tremendous amount of airfreighting going on.

That's been the story especially plastics since it began, right?

EMN-2021-Q2-2021-08-03,142,Answer,2021-08-03,2,2021,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, there's a lot of policy, as well as collaboration with the recycle -- existing recycling infrastructure that I think is amplified when we're working with brands who have a very deep relationship with the recyclers, right? So they buy a lot of recycled content today from those companies and working with them and encouraging them to broaden what they do beyond just easy-to-recycle product and making this broader waste stream available to us is a point of collaboration for us.",1.0713121,0.92

It's been many years of how well this performance films business has done both in the window film and the paint protection film. It's been a tremendous growth story.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Mark, I wanted to ask you, you highlighted quite a few times about being specialty story, obviously, the CI earnings are maybe making that a little more challenging for people to embrace. And we've seen some pretty good devaluation in your stock over the last few months, almost akin to you being lumped in with some of the peak fears that are out there on some other maybe more commoditized names. So, I guess, how do you see CI -- I mean is this going to fade and create a big step down that sort of rubs from the aggregate growth as the specialty businesses grow, do you think it can stabilize? And I mean, just looking at consensus numbers and looks like something like 2% EBITDA growth in 2022 and 2023. Can you give us some inspiration that that is inadequate?",0.3211084,0.877

You got to remember all these things that are growing really well are high value mix and the challenges we had you know in 2019 and 2020 were not spread, right?

Maybe I could just ask a similar question to Bob's here. So if we look at 2021 versus, say, 2019 or even 2022 versus 2019 EPS in the $9 or so range this year. If we look at a three-year average CAGR maybe it's around 9%, which is definitely commendable and within your 8% to 12% earlier comments from a while back. I guess is that still kind of how you're looking at it and then maybe you could just put a finer point on some of this. So if we look at next year, you have potentially some parts of the $50 million coming on from the recycling technology.

There is a certain chunky nature to sort of how the tracking business in particular performs. As I mentioned in the first quarter call, we saw a tremendous number of new business closes around Tritan applications last fall that led to orders that were quite high to fill the shelves for all these new products. So that would drive up the volume, obviously once it fills the shelves, demand drops off a bit.

We do see the business stabilizing this year. As we've discussed in the past we've got two thirds of our volume in a multiyear agreement. As Curt mentioned, we've taken a lot of actions to reduce and align and our asset footprint with the market and the cost competitive. And in fact, we're the only company that's actually rationalizing the assets since 2013 when this all started. And as I just mentioned, we're making tremendous progress in our new applications to fill these assets into new markets.

You just froze up in the beginning. So, what we're seeing in that chain is great pricing discipline. We have done quite low in our pricing for Advanced Materials if you go back to '14 through now in how we've managed that business. And the other thing to keep in mind is the increases in [indiscernible] have been pretty moderated in that part of the world compared to what you saw happen in AFP and CI.

Can I just ask on the free cash flow in the quarter and year-to-date, it looks like there has been a bit of a working capital bill that presumably is going to reverse in the second half of the year but can you just sort of help us understand what's happened and what's going to happen to get to the billing dollars.",1.3847919,0.836
EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,85,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, so as we talked early in the year, our working capital requirements are seasonally higher in the first half of the year particularly in the first quarter. If you just take the first half of this year versus last year, you know our working capital requirements were 300 million this year versus less than $200 million last year. So, part of that's again, our history as traditionally working capital requirements are released in the second half of the year, just keep in mind last year our seasonal increases in working capital kind of were helped by lower input costs. So, if you take than $300 million first half of the year impact of our operating cash flows you help a good portion of that reverses in the second half of the year.",0.8050263,0.727

To give you a sense of the amount, the best way to look at it is if you look our other segment, you'll see that our run rate for the first half and '17 is little higher than last year.

But that has been more than offset right now by ethylene margin compression in the second half of the year. So, when I look at trends for CI, I would expect some sequential decline in third quarter to these lower ethylene prices and seasonal demand for means in the egg sector. But still favorable year-over-year. That trend will be similar going in the fourth quarter, but we will no longer have this favorable year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter.",0.6805216,0.665

And so, we do also -- we're not buying -- we buy about 40% of our propylene needs, so that's relevant, we are producing the other part on it in the propylene.

We're seeing the Chinese strictly enforce environmental regulation for the first time in the last sort of 6 to 12 months. And it's really been pretty dramatic in its impact. We have a lot of small competitors in AFP and saw big ones in CI out of China.

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But those segments of within AFP just naturally have lower spreads per KG than the segment average. So, it's not margin compression, it's just a bit of a mix shift. I want to emphasize that the high value stuff is still growing with the market. So, we're not having any volume growth in coating or high value tire additives et cetera. Those are all growing fine and a little bit above market actually but these others are growing a lot faster and so you're just changing the weighted average spread a bit. So, you've got that going on, that's going to cause the net margin to be a little bit lower but it's not actually margin compression. Of course, we continue to improve prices, benefit from a little bit of trailing off raws in the second half of the year and that will help on the margin front.",0.0138549,0.93
EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,134,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And then in the innovation programs as you think about this going into '18 and'19 those are all above segment and company average margins. And so that will start driving mix in the other direction as we go into those into '18 and '19 just like we do an Advance Materials. So overall it feels good but the average margin is going to be a bit lower than the last couple of years as a result of that. But we still feel good as its been around that sort of 20% maybe just a little bit below.,0.0277099,0.676

We discussed this in the last quarter call and nothing has changed from those comments which is I know market growth rate is actually quite strong, we've sort of upgraded our review about underlying market growth in hygiene and user packaging which is the biggest drivers of our demand. You know it's now sort of growing at 5 to 7% which is great. Its caused the market to be tight, especially in '15 and '16 as there was limited supply and has led this business to having some attractive margins.",0.202934,0.944

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,142,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, not a concern long-term, the margins here are quite attractive above segment average and we're happy about how this business is performing. The margins will obviously be pressured by some of this. But what's more exciting for us is we're actually seeing a new trend of innovation in this business that we haven't seen in a while.

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,146,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, demand overall, I mean globally you get a better look at demand just by looking at tire companies for PCR and Truck. And we're growing at the market and then in some places better than the market. As I said where we had some competitive disruptions by environmental enforcement in China, this is one of those places where we are seeing that benefit in both ingredients in a material away and to some extent as well as in us inside our Sulphur Crystex products. And so, we're growing faster than the markets and that's quite helpful. But overall, we see the demand is solid and continuing to grow, but the underlying market is pretty modest.",0.0293399,0.882

Right now, I think discussing the effective tax rate beyond 2017 is a little premature given all the discussions that are going on right now in DC. Again, as Mark mentioned, we're going to continue to pursue however opportunity to optimize our business and tax structure for earnings and cash flows for the remainder of the year and going forward. And I'm also very confident that we have a great tax finance and legal team that know how to navigate whatever changes and actions are inactive that come at us.

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,151,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well in terms of China, and Asia in general, what I would say is I don't think that the underlying market growth rates are materially improving, they're still pretty modest. But we are growing quite well in Asia for a few reasons. One is the macro trends that we've talked about for long time around product safety as well as the emerging middle-income class is driving a lot of demand especially in China where people are looking for higher quality products in our specialties are key to enabling those higher quality products we're seeing better than market growth as a result of that trend.",0.0415648,0.968

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,153,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to that, I mentioned some of this environmental enforcement is helping us out where not just local customers but more importantly our multi-national customers who operate around the world including China. You know security supply is very important to them and they want to make sure that we're going to get specialty products that are essential to enabling the production of their products and not inhibit their ability to produce. So that's helping drive people to us on that front.",0.1711491,0.946
EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,154,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, a lot of different things going on well. When you look at our revenue growth in Asia Pacific, it's quite good especially when you include the headwind of fibers and it's also important to keep a mix set in mind that the majority of what we do in specialty is almost all of it is specialties, right. So that growth is high quality mix.",0.0199674,0.883
EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,155,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And one more trend that I should mention as I alluded with the question Kevin had and we'll see if this trend continues is the weakening of the dollar which helps our specialties as they compete across the globe. So, if that continues the trend, that will be favorable to Eastman. For the second half of the year we assume that this would-be kind of roughly [114, 115] as an example.",0.1268747,0.527
EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,158,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J.

I think we've demonstrated a fantastic and impressive acquisition track record both large and small in integrating and creating value from acquisitions. So, we certainly see bolt-on M&A as an avenue for growth. To be clear we're not working at large M&A. But on the bolt-on side we're looking I'd say the pipeline is in development, we're been so focused on the innovation programs and delivering organic growth and making sure we're doing everything best possible there, haven't wanted to get distracted but we are certain to build that pipeline now. So, you know hopefully we'll be adding to our growth by very accretive bolt-on M&A as we go into '18 and 19. But there is nothing imminent.",0.394458,0.974

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think you can pretty much sense that that we're seeing the growth in our specialty businesses given the trajectories, the sequential declines in our chemical and intermediates business, some modest improvement in fiber sequentially. So that our earnings growth that we'll looking for is coming from those specialties. But just keep in mind, fourth quarter tends to have a seasonal impact in our specialty so you got to just factor those things altogether.

I guess what I'm wondering is I've seen a recent study that says from a share performance, be it specialty, be it commodity but won't be something in between.

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,167,Question,2017-07-28,2,2017,Robert Koort,Goldman Sachs,"So, I'm just curious, strategically what can you do, do you buy more specialties, do you maybe change your reporting structure to isolate your best businesses or STUs better? Do you get more aggressive on the portfolio adjustments as you stay maybe go beyond just ethylene maybe some derivatives? Or do you think it's just simply getting back to attractive double-digit range growth that gets people to say.

EMN-2017-Q2-2017-07-28,168,Answer,2017-07-28,2,2017,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And I think that it's when we sell and think about making sure that everything we're doing in our strategy is focused on value creation for our shareholders.,0.2387938,0.813

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As I said, I actually think we've got a very unique capability as a specialty company, not just in the things I talked about in world-class technology and AD capability and market connect which other specialty companies pursue as well. But I actually think the integration is a unique advantage in delivering sustainable long-term growth and very unique products that our competitors can't do. Meaning when you think about integration of our technology across streams allows us to build and develop products that our competitors can't do because they don't have that breadth. The scale allows us to have dedication and expertise in different technical areas and operational disciplines that specialty company frankly can't have and a specialty company typically has much small size. They don't have experts on anything they can't afford it. This large scale gives us the ability to drive cost productivity and product development in a way that these small companies can't do.",0.5419723,0.791

Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Obviously, we're committed to minimizing volatility in our stock as much as we possibly can, that's why we're trying to get rid of the excess ethylene. There's a lot of valuations driven right now by extremely aggressive cost and CapEx cutting and buying back stock in some of our peers and as well as lots of speculation about who is going to breakup, combine and everything else. And it creates a context of looking at what we can do to also create value and we're doing everything that we can but I actually think the way we win is delivering consistent earnings results year-over-year.",0.4132029,0.856

You're going to see the three segments overtime grow including fibers because with all the new application development capability we've got the specialist becoming greater than 80% of the earnings of the total company. You know chemical remediates trying to do everything we can to always dampen volatility, exit everything we can that is not necessary for the specialties.

And you know as I mentioned in the last call, China demand is down to sort of 10% of the revenue of this business or 1% of the revenue of the company. So, the uncertainty of imports next year on that side is less relevant.

When it does will essentially be integrated back to propane with our propylene needs. So currently we produce about 55% of the propylene that we need and 40% to 45% comes from the market. In terms of the financial impact several years ago we indicated that maybe there was a $30 million benefit from that unit coming online for us.

We have been building, as we have talked to you about on the Innovation Day, a very powerful growth model that combines how we engage the market, how we leverage our technology and bring it together the application development capability. And you are seeing that right now. One of the strongest drivers of growth that we had in AFP with our animal nutrition and care chemical business and there is a place where we've combined the products of Eastman and Taminco where we have a broader portfolio of organic acids making us much more relevant to the market. Taminco team was somewhat geographically limited in their commercial execution capabilities. So we've now built the broader global capability. We've added application development capability of that, so we can be much more of a formulation expert and enhance what we are offering to the marketplace.",0.1854116,0.981
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,62,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And that's all combined to drive significant growth, incredible growth in fact for that combined sort of portfolio to the marketplace. So it's a great example. Same thing is true in tires. We've built integrated capability now where we started with what Solutia had which was somewhat limited in what they had to offer to the market, expanded it with our resin portfolios and other products that we are developing for the innovation side. So now we are not just Crystex and PPDs, but have innovative resins that can improve the performance of tires, built strong application development capability where we are insightful and now we design those products and it can be a true advising consultant in formulating the tire and we've gone for debating the price of Crystex in 2012 to being an innovation partner with all the top MNCs in this space as well as some of the key leading agent players. So these examples of the growth model bringing capability together is driving double-digit growth in tires across that portfolio, strong double-digit growth in animal nutrition and we are doing this in a bunch of other places.",0.2000815,0.993
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,68,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So first on the question on the enterprise contract, that has not had a material impact on our first quarter input costs or performance. On the balance of propylene remember and consumer propylene we produce - I think we are pretty balanced on what we produce now, what we need for derivatives, including that enterprise contract.",0.7302363,0.494
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,70,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So let me just recap the change in revenue recognition hopefully just this one time. In 2007 let me remind you revenue was recorded based on confirmed delivery dates. In 2018 revenue we recorded based on goods shipped which will accelerate when revenue is recognized compared to previous years. So we believe this method is more consistent with industry practice. To transition to this new method, let me also remind you we've recorded an increase to return earnings for $53 million, what this really relates to is the net earnings of approximately $200 million of revenue for product that had shipped and now you delivered at the end of 2017. So this transitional revenue will be recognized in revenue or EBIT in 2018. There is a new method. So this ensures both 2017 and 2018 only have 52 weeks of revenue in each period. So, as such again as you mentioned this change is not expected to have a material impact on revenue or EBIT for 2018 taken as a whole when compared to previous years.",0.5647922,0.743
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,71,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"However, as you have seen in the first quarter, this impacts seasonal trends of revenue and EBIT within the year. So looking specifically at first quarter, the first quarter revenue impact under the new standard in 2018 was driven mostly by fibers as mentioned in my prepared comments. We had a similar but smaller revenue impact on advance materials offset by similar change in chemical intermediates. So when you put it altogether, the company probably accelerated $30 million of revenue and roughly $18 million of EBIT or $0.10 a share in the first quarter of '18 that would otherwise be recognized later in 2018 if we are under the old method. So again this change has not impacted our expectation of strong revenue and EBIT growth for the company or any segments when comparing 2008 versus 2007 full year.",0.4119804,0.902
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,75,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we don't provide specific breakup. What I can tell you and we said in the past is Tritan as an example is around $300 million double-digit growth, very powerful story there where we continued to be the most unique offering of clarity chemical resistance and toughness in that marketplace and extending into a lot of new applications and that's just one third if you will of the premium products, so the heads of display [indiscernible] is of similar size, also growing double digits and very attractive margins to the segment and the company and performance films also similar size to Tritan growing at double digits with very attractive margin. So it's a pretty big percentage of the overall total, but it's still got a ton of room to grow double digits for quite some time because these markets are quite a bit bigger than where we are today.",0.1462918,0.867
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,77,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J.

As you think about the long term, we still view the long term in the 8% to 12% range, there are some unique advantages we have this year in currency for example that you don't plan on repeating in the future years, but we think that's a very compelling range for us to grow sustainably and consistently every year as we go forward and with an increasing free cash flow to go with it, I think it's a very powerful story for the market.",0.1495518,0.966

We remain engaged with multiple parties with a long term view who are interested in leveraging our integrated ethylene position in the United States as well as there's parties interested in our land utilities and other infrastructure to build a derivative project at the Longview site.

EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,84,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So the specific change in the marketplace is Exxon's bringing on some capacity in Asia this year and we expect that to have some impact on margins. It has not yet had an impact on margins, they're still in the process of starting up and qualifying that product to the marketplace, so it's really more of a back half of your risk at this point. To keep in mind of the amount of capacity outings is around 90,000 tons, the market's growing around 25,000 to 30,000 tons a year because it has this incredible underlying market growth of 5% to 7% hygiene. Also the markets are incredibly tight right now, so there's a lot of pent up demand for hydrogenated resins that we expect to help fill out that asset and accelerate fill out rate. And another thing to keep in mind is their market trend's now driving rosins to be converted to resins, rosins is about the same size as the resin market - overall resin market. And there's a lot of pressure on that there's a very strong order to raw and not great color and so the market has become very sensitive to order in adhesives especially in Asia, so a lot of people are looking to sort of convert from one to the other, so that's another way of demand sort of filling up this asset. Overall, we feel comfortable that this is a great attractive business long term. Obviously we'll see some short term pressure here as that capacity comes to the marketplace, but there's such strong demand potential we see the long term margins being quite attractive.",0.0271585,0.907
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,90,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, it's a great question and it goes back to something I talked about in the first question. As we have built this growth model and seeing the power of how application development connects sort of markets and technology together, we launched a program last year not just to build this capability but to reexamine how our business teams are structured and making sure that we have the right products aligned to take advantage of that capability. And we realize that there are some products that were still being sold in CI that would be much more effectively sold in AFP by bringing our better market connect and our application development capability to bear in these products we could accelerated growth sustain those margins. And these products are actually pretty attractive margins to start off with and some of them are already being sold partially by AFP and we're just consolidating all the product into one place to be more efficient in how we manage the assets. So it just made sense, so animal nutrition was one of those places where we saw that opportunity, with the success we're now seeing in that marketplace and we're cleaning that up and there are also some products in coatings that made sense to sort of have all sold in one place with that greater commercial and technical capability. So the natural thing you do is you're still revolving your strategy and see what you can do and want to maximize your growth.",0.3207009,0.995
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,92,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So as Curt mentioned around revenue recognition, the principal driver of the revenue looking higher on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter was actually revenue recognition method being different this year versus last year, it's a very long supply chain for a lot of that tow to go from Kingsport, Tennessee to markets around the world. And as a result of the coal gas incident we weren't shipping as much in the beginning of the quarter as we normally do as we were bringing out asset back up and then ramping up the production of the downstream tow product. So a lot of that product shipped in March that would have shipped earlier and so we have these two different methods it just gets caught up as recognized revenue this year, but would've not shown up in the same way last year, so that's part of it P.J. The other part was obviously some of the revenue being transferred, the 30 million revenue from other two - the fiber segment, so we actually sort of put it on an apples to apples basis from a revenue recognition basis. The two volumes within this story are about flat year-over-year, so it isn't a story of growth or decline in tow. It's stable as we said last year, we expected to volume to be stable this year to last year and that's what we expect and you'll see on a full year basis that will be stable.",0.0741646,0.911
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,98,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Jeff, you can't translate that in that direct way. You've got different set of products you're selling in specialties with different supply demand dynamics and selling on values, the price of those olefin derivatives are going to be determined by those market conditions and even within CI, in the market prices and the value captured isn't directly correlated to ethylene and propylene. I know that everyone sort of tends to make that simplistic assumption that there's all going up and down with propylene and ethylene prices, but it doesn't work that way. We don't sell propylene at all, right. We sell derivatives and specialties and chemical intermediates and the value in the pricing of that's actually holding up quite well through the first quarter as well as into the second including ethylene. Of course some of that is being offset by the bulk ethylene that we're selling into the marketplace at much lower prices, so you can't sort of do that translation one for one like that.",0.3441427,0.923
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,102,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So Aerafin has been a product we've had in the marketplace for over a year and the growth rate in interest of it has been quite strong fifty some a component over all of overall more polyolefin program which in total is showing very strong double digit growth but in this particular area we're seeing a strong uptake and we had some capacity limits or expect to I should say as we go into this year. And we're right and expand capacity going seeing any risk of missing orders but we're rushing to get this capacity online to continue supporting the strong interest but we're not going to provide the detail breakout on a quantitative basis.,0.3207009,0.976
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,104,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So animal nutrition has been tremendous volume growth as well as improvement in pricing as a markets become tighter for two factors. The first would be the answer to David's question around how we build a better commercial technical capability the second factor driving it is China environmental enforcement has shut down some of our competitors in this space as well as competitors in the tire space and some of the coatings sourcing benefits across the segment AFP as well as CI. And that's helped on the pricing front as well as the volume growth from a sustainability point of view the innovation the commercial executions all very much sustainable it's just growing in the marketplace in China environmental force and part of that question I think is we'll have to see oil plays out. I mean these are players that have been shut down for environmental violations they have to either rebuild in a chemical park and operate a higher cost structure under better environmental standard if they can get the financing or they will come back. And so in a few places you can see people trying to build and that and they will come back bench a little higher cost structure and in some places we don't expect that they will so that we'll have to just see how it plays out over time but for this year we expected to be to be very attractive. Both pricing and volume growth I would emphasize that there's a sustainable advantage that we get out of all this and that many of our customers both the big MNC around the world as well as many of our Chinese customers have learned a painful lesson about how much they want to depend on a small private single plant in China supplying their needs on critical products so pretty much apartments are having to revaluate how much of that risk they want to take going forward. And I think it really emphasizes the value that we provide as assists and sustainable supplier on a global basis.,0.2624287,0.975
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,107,Question,2018-04-27,1,2018,Kevin McCarthy,Vertical Research,Good morning Mark back at the Investor Day and I think on various earnings calls you've alluded to the concept of upgrading your mix across a variety of specialty products is there a way to quantify the benefit from that either or either retrospectively or prospected Lee in terms of margin uplift you've got a lot going on across a lot of different products just wondering if you have in your mind any sort of path or rule to help us understand better the benefits associated with those efforts on the margin line.,0.1724826,0.92
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,108,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes So one this is the heart of our story and our strategy it's a great question we've got double digit growth in a wide range of products across AM and AFP from Triton to heads up display could secure layers, to performance films to some display products that the resins in tires touch or shield and they in AFP, the list goes on. So all these are above segment average margins as well as above company average margins and so as they grow the weighted average mix on the variable margin of the corporate line is going up so it's attractive from a specific point of view we actually provided several slides that innovation day that actually give you sort quantitative look about how we've dramatically improve the margins from 2010 to '17 and our outlook for how those margins will continue to improve at the corporate level and as well as an example in that in advance materials from 2018 to '20, so I think those slides will be helpful for you.",0.5162999,0.981

EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,110,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so the tariff question is a good one on that acetate flake side. It's unclear - first of all it's unclear what projects will finally be implemented versus what's on a preliminary list, they often change. Second, it's unclear when they might implement this if ever and in this case it's unclear how the tariff would be applied seen to she's a government entity so you're sort of just moving tax revenue from one pocket to another pocket, so we'll just have to see how that all plays out.",0.101467,0.026

EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,113,Question,2018-04-27,1,2018,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you just a question on the tow volume. Mark, you referenced a very long supply chain and I've noticed that two of the larger tobacco companies reported already and they've got volume down about 6%, 7%. So I'm just wondering you're expecting to be flat for the year and cigarette volumes move around all the time, so I don't read too much into to one quarter of their results, but when would we expect to see that type of a down quarter flow through your tow volume?",0.8262865,0.19
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,114,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Good question, Vincent and you said the key thing in the beginning or at the end or your comments, which is one quarter is not something we're active by a couple of companies, I think we need to see how they all report, you share ships around a lot between these guys on a quarter-to-quarter basis and what the overall market trends are. We're not seeing anything that says that there's certainly been an acceleration or the downturn of cigarette demand from what our customers are telling us. So at this stage we're not expecting a change in tow demand in a material way. I think we're just have to see how this plays out. There's been a lot of very consistent steady sort of 2% or 3% decline in this business for a very long time and I think we need to give it a little more time before we start to sort of reacting to sort of that one quarter benefit.",0.0028525,0.817
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,115,Question,2018-04-27,1,2018,Vincent Andrews,Morgan Stanley,Okay and just is there sort of a wisdom on sort of how long supply chain or so?,0.677155,0.613
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,120,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Curtis E. Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"No, negatives in AM, I think we're just going to see a strong high single digit revenue growth for the year driven by the things you just mentioned, volume, significant mix of grades that we've consistently done for several years now, some pricing improvement, FX tailwind all sort of come together to sort of deliver that. On the AFP side, it's obviously been incredibly strong in the first quarter, we expect to continue the strength in the second quarter and by the way AM and AFP we do expect seasonal improvement in revenue and earnings from first and second quarter. But there is a tougher comp in the back half of the year AFP. You have to remember last year we had very high solar fill volume for a couple of huge projects come in, in the third and the fourth quarter. That won't repeat this year, we do see fills coming in '19 and '20, so it's just sort of chunkiness issue in this year versus last year and the future. There's also the other dynamic. This environmental China enforcement drove constant and meaningful share improvement for us through last year, so you saw the benefit of that really in the third and fourth quarter. There is an additional environmental enforcement on top of what we benefited from, so we're holding our share this year but obviously that's a tougher comp to last year in the back half. And then the third thing is some price pressure in adhesives as I already mentioned. All those sort of make the comp tougher. We do expect earnings growth year-over-year in the back half of the year and just to be clear and we actually expect margins to sequentially improve from first quarter to second and third as the mix continues to improve the specialty innovation products, but will just be a tougher comp to '17.",0.2099716,0.989

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"It is not a primary demand story, we go to extensive effort in our market segmentation and targeting where we have the best value proposition and aligning ourselves with the customers who we believe are going to have the highest growth, so we have really seen benefits in Asia in particular of aligning with the winners in that market and seeing the benefit as they're taking share and consolidating frankly failing Chinese tire companies into themselves and so we're benefiting from that. On top of that you have the share gains as I mentioned from environmental enforcement, on top of that you have the innovation growth that's happening where we have double digit growth and things like our tire resins, it all combines together to a story of where we're creating our own growth in a market where the underlying primary demand as you noted is not that strong.",0.0944467,0.985

EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,130,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So as you saw in the first quarter tremendous growth in Europe and Asia and we'll continue to see strong growth in those regions as the economies are improving in Europe, Asia still may not be the growth of old days in China, it's still very attractive growth compared to the rest the world and we're benefiting from our positions in there as well throughout Asia. And their overall sort of automotive market is going a little stronger than people expected at the beginning the year, so that's great for us of course. So I'd say it feels good everywhere. To be clear forecast isn't forecasting improved economy, so if that does happen that would be upside to our forecast. We believe in sort of realizing the growth that we're having. It's also important to member that revenue growth doesn't just include volume, it includes FX and price improvements et cetera.",0.4547677,0.991
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,134,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So let me sort of take that in two parts, first is sort of our overall view of demand in the world and then I'll get to sort of the second part of the question. Overall, demand as I mentioned, we don't see a significant change in the overall demand of cigarettes, we expect sort of slow decline outside of China. If you look at Chinaman at primary level, I think it's actually been a lot more stable than any of us thought, there was a overbuilding of inventory that was occurring in '11m '12 and '13 and then there was a destocking in that backward integration that they had with JV's with us and others that created a huge serve up and then down in tow in that marketplace. But underlying it I think it's stable. I'd also note that at this stage the exposure to imports into China with tow is down to about 5% of our revenue in the segment or half of 1% at the company level, so the exposure we have to that question right now has been dramatically reduced on what happens inside China.",0.2371638,0.764
EMN-2018-Q1-2018-04-27,135,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark J. Costa,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The key element of how we think about this business stays the same as it always has been. We're focused on running our business the best we possibly can and I think we're doing a good job of that. So we've secured a lot of our volume outside of China, two thirds of it in these long term agreement to provide stability and volume and pricing for our customers and for us. We're obviously pursuing productivity aggressively this year in amount of cost we think we can improve including our raw materials and that's going to help offset - will offset the price declines that we expect this year. But most importantly to our story is on the asset side when we added capacity in China we took out capacity in UK and now we're down to our last asset in flake largest lowest cost asset back with integrated coal and our tow capacity that we have left matches that flake. So we're focused on how we fill that remaining capacity, that excess capacity including what declines may come with their innovation, so as I just told you in the beginning of this call we're seeing tremendous success in textiles, we're also seeing success in the non-olefins where we're going to get strong double digit growth this year over last year in this space. And while the margins on tow, they're decent attractive margins somewhere to sort of company average. And that's how we feel these assets and driver - earnings growth net for this business. And so we're going to repurpose those assets - this excess capacity to markets where we see attractive growth, the ability to value them up over time and where markets actually grow and that's what we've done for 90 years in cellulosic and we'll keep doing it.",0.1320293,0.996

Espeland,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, over the next two to three years what we've been talking about is we do have cost productivity goals. To some degree those are being used to help offset some of the increase in manufacturing costs, some of the turnaround cost et cetera. So our productivity is helping us grow in the right places, but you all will see some growth in some of the SG&A and R&D areas. Manufacturing does an outstanding job offsetting inflation and trying to give us a little bit more than that, but again those investments what we call cost increases they are investments and you need to see those in great increases because that's what drives the future growth profile of this company.",0.085529,0.974

It's very attractive business, we love it, but it has a tendency to be a little chunky.

Our supply chain does sort of miraculous things every day. When you think about how we didn't miss an order through the hurricanes last year, when you think about the phenomenal things we did of bringing acetic acid into the site during the coal gas interruption and then also managing a very complex inventory supply chain problem to serve all of our customers last year and not miss any orders through that recovery effort and we're really good at this.

It's been good pricing improvements through the first quarter, we expect those mostly to hold into the second and that business to be stable through the year. I think it's obviously a different story, but even on there the out lenders are pretty stable, so just down to the ball cap win where obviously prices were lower, which is really a second half impact.
