This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products, and continued robust Open Trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth, and reached a record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million, was up 6% compared to Q3 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million, and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02.",0.4194139,0.972

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,9,Remarks,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatilities fell, and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads, and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions has been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong, and position the company well for future growth.",2.1423993,0.976

Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter, and was up 58% to a year record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion, also up 58%. Open Trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price-makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter.

Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity.

Our U.S. high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior, leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year, and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit.

Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year. A slight increase in estimated market share accounts for the uplift in trading volume as U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated U.S. high-grade market share is up one percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets, and U.S. high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate.",0.951832,0.7

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Healthy market share gains was the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volume, 27% growth in high-yield volume, and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level.",0.929189,0.961
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,17,Remarks,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. The 11% increase in trading volume resulted in 5% uplift in commissions. New data contracts accounted for the $800,000 increase in information services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and we customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%.",0.7039934,0.71
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,18,Remarks,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter, and 21.6% year-to-date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range, and now expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares.",0.3692878,0.935
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,19,Remarks,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years of maturity and higher yields caused a reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture.",1.1202141,-0.511
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,20,Remarks,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"That said, U.S. high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially, and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade size bucket. Our Other Credit category's fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. So percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter, and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels.",0.7871552,0.586

Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and tradeshow spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses was 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. Our full-year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense.",0.815562,0.459

Cash and investments as of September 30th were $446 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $15 million, and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $178 million.

We are pleased with the overall growth in estimated market share across all products during the quarter.

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,30,Question,2018-10-24,3,2018,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market forum was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps from the efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space?,,-0.317
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,31,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I think this is a continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead Axess in the system and identity offsetting interest in that trade, they could do so with any trade size and have the opportunity to work up trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols in newly issued bonds that would introduce faster means of execution for highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trade sizes.",1.452381,0.691
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,32,Question,2018-10-24,3,2018,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking to add around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period-end employee count, and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter-to-quarter, so should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual give what the volume environment looked like during the quarter?",,0.919
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,33,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes, so Patrick, two things in there on the headcount, and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefit. On the headcount, we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have start days in the fourth quarter, so we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit we don't know what will happen with attrition, but we are sitting on 15 additional add.",0.4405105,0.431
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,34,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was just a slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits. It was around a $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower. The cash bonus accrual is formulaic; it is tied to operating performance. And quarter-to-quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you should see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes Q2 to Q3, you saw pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there.",0.2762454,0.989

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,39,Question,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"And congrats on the uptick in the Open Trading percentage, I guess the first question is on Open Trading. And it seems like quarter-to-quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in there, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield. The others went up by like a percent or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter, from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove that big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in Open Trading?",,0.952
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,40,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, a couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of Open Trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that Open Trading is providing the highest value in less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield, that we've just seen better take-up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way and reduce transactions costs and in a less liquid market, like high-yield.",1.202381,0.913
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,41,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other thing I'd point out is we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT.",1.1199634,0.511
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,42,Question,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Thanks, Rick. A follow-up on Open Trading is, I would assume the ETFs -- well, just some comments on auto ex as well, just the trend there. If Open Trading pick up I assume the auto ex and the drivers -- one of the drives is ETFs, that you would see auto ex also increasing?",,0.727
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,43,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right at auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you all know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on, to low-touch, and now even moving into no-touch, where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they're able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfection willing to auto-execute a transaction on the system.",0.3498168,0.969
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,44,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade. It's really about do the price responses come back to meet the clients' preset expectations. And if they do they're willing to auto-execute those trades.,0.349359,0.743
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,45,Question,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q, and I think these are from your comments that July and August were a different story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think, even more volatility in October. And you may have covered this, but if you did I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October. But can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility, like September, October.",,0.758
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,46,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, October, if you look at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield, very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months. And September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall. But we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October, and the product mix will drive the fee capture.",0.4940476,0.888

Just a follow-up on auto ex, but maybe more so on the Composite+ product, really just want to updated thoughts on the future of Composite+ and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem.

No, we're really pleased to see both dealer, investor, clients embracing Composite Price Plus, which is a real-time mid-market now in about 20,000 global securities. So, incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products; it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well.

And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking streaming price protocols, and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices or RFQ as we are looking out maybe over the next three or five years?

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,55,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices, and so the technology here. It's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And to date, institutional investors have stuck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up, I do think it's possible that streaming prices especially to more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency. And when the market is ready to go in that direction then we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective.",0.4807692,0.982

So the high yield open trading has really accelerated in the last couple of quarters. I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters; previously, it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETF, I just want to understand is are the ETF market makers what has driven the vast majority that acceleration or there are other factors?",0.3270018,0.612
MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,61,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There are other factors as a key ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high yield trading overall and open trading adoptions specifically from one only investment managers. And a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high yield trading environment which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in funds flow. So I think it's a combination of adoption by not only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield.",0.992674,0.963

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,69,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"You saw from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets in Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think that one thing that points to -- this is more particularly for the emerging market than Eurobonds right now, market volumes are still struggling. So even we gave some commentary that October market volumes for U.S. investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one it's while healthier than the third quarter, you are not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October.",1.896978,0.718

Or it's just the environment has got a little bit better and trading activities are kind of picking up?

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,72,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would separate the two but the clearly the broad based gains that we are seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products this is shaping up to be one of our strongest years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual for fact it's being driven more by EM, high yield and euros this year than it is in high grade, but even high grade up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively, the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we have ever had.

There is open trading at the bigger piece across all of our core products. Open trading is the bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products. That's up hundred clients just in the past year.

We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We have been -- and the thing that we look at more is around years of maturity and where absolute yields are.

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"You know, it's a little bit of both, I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility that would be helpful to our share gains and as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where when new issues are extremely active there is a slice of trace that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of. So the new issue market has that impact, but we're playing a long game. We take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be five or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me.",0.6895842,0.974

MKTX-2018-Q3-2018-10-24,84,Answer,2018-10-24,3,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes, sure Jeremy, so we hadn't completed the budget process yet for 2019, so we're not prepared at least today to give you definitive range, but that said I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you look to 2018, and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate would be right around 24%. That's really the jumping off point for 2019. But the difficult part is -- it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this that sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefits there would be around $2 million. So jumping off point -- and again, budget's not complete, jumping off point 24%, rolling some excess tax benefits. So, to be something less than 24%, but when we get to this January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you.",0.7254014,0.908

You talked about some headcount that's coming on in the fourth quarter.

We are -- you know, we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There's some regulatory related spend as well -- and just on the tax rate, you know, we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January, but you know, again thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9% and then if you look longer term the past five years, the compound annual growth rate has also been about 9% and we're going to continue -- we had plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion in our infrastructure. I suggest taking history into account and at least -- from modeling out sort of early models on 2019, will give more color in January, but that 9% that's where we've been and that's probably a pretty good starting point.",0.7324002,0.949

So again if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture, but there are -- there's so many things that influence fee capture around, years of maturity, trade size, dealer mix.

Global trading volumes passed $1 trillion on a year-to-date basis, up $132 billion year-over-year. U.S. high-grade volumes were $201 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 9%, while estimated aggregate market volumes for emerging market, high-yield, and Eurobond was down 5% year-over- year. There has been a fairly consistent pattern over the past three quarters with strong growth in emerging markets trading on our platform and lower than average growth in high-yield in Eurobonds.",0.9271305,0.931

Total variable transaction fees were up 2% year-over-year as 8% increase in trading volume was offset by a mix shift and the impact of our new high-yield fee plan. U.S. high-grade fee capture was up $7 per million on a sequential basis maybe due to a roughly half year increase in years to make sure the on bonds traded over the platform.",0.7212845,0.71

Our other credit category fee capture was down $22 on the sequential basis. In addition to the typical swings and fee capture was only resulting from fee mix among products and protocol.

MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,45,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Patrick. Today the retail segment has largely remained separate and apart from the institutional business that we operate and we don't really see any changes to that dynamic. And, our Tradeweb acquisition of BondDesk four-five years ago as an example of where that business to this day remains largely retail business without much intersection into the institutional business. We have great respect for Japanese team at ISE and what they have been able to accomplish and we are sure that they've been thoughtful about the acquisition.",0.382326,0.961
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,46,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think our calculation in thought process for a variety of reasons was a little bit different and as Tony pointed we are very active in that segment of the market already and our share has been growing very rapidly in $250,000 under trade sizes. And, when we look at it today, our share of those trade sizes is greater than all of other retail ATS systems in the aggregate.

If we were to see more competition in the institutional space, what would, I guess, concern you more, would it be - somebody entered with an aggressive pricing strategy if somebody had new trading protocols, is there anything out there that somebody can do that, you would say, hey, this would really kind of concern us and it would look different from everything we've seen in the past?",,0.659
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,51,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think we've seen a lot Patrick as you know, you've been following us for many years, but we've seen various competitors come with new pricing schedules including zero pricing in some cases, we've seen them come with new protocols and new approaches, but what has proven to be the case through time is that our 17 years of very heavy investment in building our technology platform with a variety of trading protocols relevant to institutional investors. And, building the broadest network of liquidity providers and clients on our system has made it difficult for new entrance to come in to the space. And, there is no sign of that changing, I think all the competitive data that we picked up again during the third quarter demonstrates that we continue to be the strongest E-trading platform in credit markets and that our growth rates are extending that lead.",0.1904762,0.802
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,52,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, I think what we worry is that we were not investing, if we were standing still and hoping to maintain our share based on what we have done in the past, I think that would be an enormous mistake. The reality is we're investing more than anyone in the space by a wide margin. So, we continue to add client segments, we continue to add new products to our trade systems, we include, we continue to add new trading protocols. And, importantly we are investing very heavily in data tool for our clients. And, to me that investment is what gives me confidence, so we can continue to extend our competitive lead.",0.6904762,0.772

I think as you would expect, we are very interested in acquisitions they are going to add important clients to our platform or new product capabilities or new geographies.

MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,58,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, our calculation on this one was that this is a very modest add in terms of earnings accretion for our shareholders in a very full price.

We've been gaining a lot of attraction in retail. And, we're happy to put together more specific numbers, but the retail liquidity providers and increasingly the wealth advisors and retail brokerage firms are important part of the daily trade that takes place on MarketAxess, and that is why you see our share of 250,000 an under larger than anyone else by a wide margin.",0.0137363,0.948
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,63,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,What we would need to do to compete directly with the retail ATS businesses is to convert what is now an institutional protocol which is highly competitive RFQ into a price stage for above which is a pretty straightforward change and add a bit more sales focused in terms of convincing retail market participants to take advantage of the pricing that's on our system.,0.2028388,0.895
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,64,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, the reason that we have the largest share in the $250,000 an under trade segment is because we have the best places in that space and that is why the most price competitive clients in the world use MarketAxess for micro lots and I am highly confidence as we focus more on this we have an organic opportunity to continue to expand our retail business.",0.8846154,0.944

We've been targeting about 1/3 pay out of free cash flow in earnings.

So, really no plans, but we do have - we have the flexibility to change that. But today it's a bit status flow on the capital policy and it's a little bit jump right now, yes, I think if there was something to do in the retail space right now, we would have leverage on, and it wouldn't have been an unusual amount of leverage to put on the balance sheet, but that would have been an event that would have made us add the leverage on to the balance sheet.",0.8999588,0.759

MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,71,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We are happy with the growing participation that we see in open trading, but there is no doubt that the market environment has an impact on those growth rates as it does for our overall business. And, I think when the time was out for open trading is going to really show its value to our clients as we move from an environment that is heavily one way with investors looking to add bonds especially in U.S. credit to a two way market where investors and dealers are both looking for alternative sources of liquidity.",0.3415751,0.81
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,72,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, this is far from a normal secondary market environment that we are dealing in right now. But when we see the participation numbers continue to grow for both dealers and investors in open trading, we think we're positioning the business very well for the future in terms of being an extremely valuable source of liquidity when the market conditions change.",0.6446886,0.699
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,73,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Christopher Shutler,William Blair & Company,"Okay, great. And, then on the global regulatory changes that you guys talked about MiFID and everything, the expenses; can you maybe quantify what you're occurring this year and what the next year can be higher or lower, and then in any sense from a revenue perspective or an opportunity perspective just, how you may benefit, I know you talked to quantify at this point, but any broad sense?",0.220339,0.649
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,74,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes, Chris, I'll give you some sense on the expense side and then we'll have Rick cover a little bit on the revenue side. We are occurring additional expenses this year, this is not only what you see in the professional consulting line, what you saw that in the third quarter, the majority of that uplift year-over-year professional consulting and the majority of the uplift from the second quarter to third quarter had to do with planning on MiFID II embraced it and establishing new trading venues and other jurisdictions and responding to all these real changes, but there was an additional expenses this quarter in particular, we expect some of the expenses to recur, some of them are non recurring, but chunk of that will recur.",0.4849732,0.214
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,75,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And, other piece which is more technology related, we've had to do some things to respond to the evolving regulation that has become Arm and APA register and it's somewhere around $4.5 million this year that we have incurred this has been capitalized once MiFID II goes live, we will start to amortizing those costs over a three year period, but that's another addition to the - the item that hit the expense line, you're also seeing about $4 million-$4.5 million in capitalized costs as well, some of that can recur, some of that will - as the landscape changes here, we registered more jurisdictions and we are meeting clients need across the globe, you will see an increase in expenses like that.",0.4289831,0.85
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,76,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the revenue side Chris, I think we are well advantage or well position to take the advantage of the changes taking place primarily through MiFID II, first of course our track status business should benefit from the increase in regulatory reporting obligations for both dealers and investors and given the clients option of tractions, the reporting mechanism, we do anticipate the reporting revenues will be higher beginning in January of next year.",0.1053114,0.889
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,77,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Secondly our data products are doing well and a lot of that generates from tracks data products and its clients are really required to think more specifically about that execution and transaction costs data and the critical component of that analysis.,0.2307692,-0.052
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,78,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, then finally on the trading side, clearly their advantage is for investors and dealers to trade on regulated trading venues built into MiFID II, and we would continue to expect that our trading activity will grow on a regulated trading venues, and we think we are already seeing signs of that as our growth rates in trading volume with European clients are currently outpacing growth rates elsewhere in the world.",0.2797619,0.836
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,79,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we really think we will benefit from all three sides of our business from an increase in electronic trading adoption from growing regulatory reporting revenue and then from a bigger base of revenue coming out of our data products.",0.260989,0.718
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,80,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Christopher Shutler,William Blair & Company,"Okay, thanks. And, one last one on the high-grade fee rates Tony, it looks like October quarter today that the volumes are little more tilted to larger bonds, so is high-grade fee capture turning down a little from Q3 levels so far in the quarter?",0.2364115,0.743
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,81,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"As much as I would like to tell you, this day-to-day and month-to-month with the high-grade fee capture, it looks like even our overall fee capture looks like, we are typically not providing that level of granularity, you are right that when you look at trades volume for this month in October, the larger trade sizes have picked up a little bit. But Chris I'll tell you one thing on fee capture one thing to be defensive about going forward is if you look at that other credit category you just remember that we didn't have the full set of the high-yield fee plan selected in third quarter. So, you will see often being equal, you would expect the other credit fee capture to go down to fourth quarter. So, just be cautious, just be cautious of the balance. And, outline that they - you have to bit of a flip between distribution fees and variable transaction fees, and I don't know high-yield plan is actually today's volume level is actually mildly accreted. So, it's a bit of geography which just sent to that fee capture line of another credit.",0.7982709,0.902

MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,84,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi, good morning. Just I guess a follow up on MiFID II, you just outlined that could accelerate electronic verification in the market. You believe that's going to accelerate electronic verification in the market. But in the quarter we saw MarketAxess in other trading platforms in Europe addressed to letter to ESMO then MiFID II could drive business away from Europe. I'm just trying to understand if you could - or you could help us understand this dynamic or its potential risk?",,0.823
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,85,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Our concern is that the regulatory reporting requirements are so onerous that any client that does not need to be captured within the MiFID II environment will choose to operate outside of it. And, you see some signs of that already with client segments that are not directly in the EU. So, I think that's a view that we had set out, I don't think it necessarily changes the amount of trading that clients will do within European fixed income or emerging markets which are very active within the European region, but any client can avoid the obligations that are built into MiFID II is working pretty hard right now to do so.",0.1414835,0.549
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,86,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And, the point of letters, the reporting obligations in our thing, our acceptance, trade-by-trade reporting requirement is 75 PLs is something that we have never seen and we are working very hard to tracks to make that easiest possible for our customers. But I think anyone would acknowledge that, that is a significant burden for institutional investors that have thousands of transactions for day in many cases.",0.3740842,0.512
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,87,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay. And, then, I guess one more on MiFID, just adding color on what you're seeing in terms of changing behaviors at this point from MiFID II, I know you said Europe growth is outpacing the U.S. growth, but are you having discussions with some of these global asset managers out there entire business including the U.S. or is this really going to be isolated to the European business in your view with kind of the U.S. trying to stay out of - a lot of these regulations?",,0.519
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,88,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"That's an open question right and I think global asset managers are grappling with that right now, if they run a global portfolio and unfortunately it's in Europe, do they need to adopt MiFID II standards for the entire portfolio or just for the component that's in the Europe? And, I think every firm has a slightly different view and opinion on that. But I think it's safe to say it's having implication beyond just Europe.",0.9020147,0.572
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,89,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The primary areas we are focused right now, is not an area we deal directly - the whole area about dealer research. So, there is a ripple effect going on beyond Europe. Most of the activities that were involved within Europe as clients get ready to comply with the new reporting requirements, the new best set requirements and fulfill all of their obligations that are built into MiFID II.",0.3663004,0.904
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,90,Question,2017-10-25,3,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay. Just one more for me, really there is a recent article in the journal written regarding the increases of ALGOS and automated trading by dealers in the U.S. corporate debt markets. I think this is an opportunity that you mentioned in the past, but just wondering what the impact could be to your business, are you seeing increased adoption of ALGOS by dealers in your platform, and just wondering if you think this could increased hit rates in your platform overtime?",,0.71
MKTX-2017-Q3-2017-10-25,91,Answer,2017-10-25,3,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We have - it's part of the growing success that we are having small tick sizes is that the growth in ALGOS is significantly increasing, the price responses for smaller trades. And, most of that activity that is fully electronic from the ALGOS is 500,000 an under trade sizes in corporate bonds. But we've definitely seen an increase number of ALGOS that are live and that work on the MarketAxess System and we are aware more that are coming, and I think it's very positive development for the small ticket business and corporate bonds because the clients will see more pricing and more competition on the back of those investments.",0.4583333,0.945

So, my first question is, Ricky talked about in this other credit that emerging markets, the growth has outpaced high-yield in Eurobonds and certainly that's the case year-over-year. But if you look more recently it's probably a lot more mix. So, I guess, if you could, I don't know whether there is any different any insight you can add to the growth rates in that bucket, the other credit bucket between high-yield emerging markets in Eurobonds like, what's going on there that cause, now emerging markets looks like it's dropping off quarter-over-quarter and so forth?",,0.978

And, I think you can look back at previous periods and see when credit spread volatility this benign, you do get flatter growth rates that when credit expense are more accrual especially when they're arising and we have reached the level in credit spreads where I would suggest that the next big move is going to be wider spreads, because we are now at levels that where spreads do not normally go any lower, the key question is when that starts to happen.",0.2399267,0.944

I assume one last question on BondPoint, way you explained in fact that you have a lot of the customers, you have a lot of retailer, you have a lot of small liquidity, and I guess you would expect given your liquidity, your match rates I would assume be much higher except for this what you pointed out the streaming coding capabilities. So, I guess, my question is, how fast could you build that and is that, if that's the case like why do people have been using BondPoint, if you have the liquidity other than the streaming capability, how fast can you build it, and is it a question of allocation of investment or capital and so forth?",,0.727

But you're right it's all about prioritization, right? And, when you look inside the retail market in U.S. credit and you look at trade, Rich, what you will see is the total market share trades in $250,000 an under trades is about 5% of trades.

And, the new fee plan obviously includes benefits for our clients and liquidity takers as well, because the variable fee is roughly half of where we had been prior to change.

And, all the ETF are - that are very active trading the shares versus the bonds, those trading opportunities right now are very limited and you can see a significant drop-off in their activity, not just here, but Patrick if you look at each share trading in the major high-yield funds, ETF funds, you will also see significant drop-offs in HYG, J and K, share trading, and that's really the story of this quarter of our high-yield business.",0.2188645,0.848

And, it's quite possible that tomorrow might see beginning of a change in ECB quantitative easing policies, the market is awaiting their announcements on what they intend to do, but it would be a significant change if the ECB stops buying corporate bonds and storing them away on the balance sheet in terms of more trading opportunities going back to the private market and to institutional investors versus what we've been dealing with over the last 18 months.",0.2252747,0.884

As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High grade and high yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years.

Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%.

Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher US high-grade fee capture. US high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. Combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets and sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution fees was due to variances and unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans.",0.0337587,0.922

The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors including M&A transaction and integration costs, and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform along with the amortization of acquired intangibles.

With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past five years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation. Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of the March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants.

We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses consistent with the trend over the past several years. We have built the plan using a sterling to US dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance.

I guess my first question is for Tony on the expenses, and just kind of the outlook. Looking at the organic expense growth, it's slightly higher than where I think you started out last year in terms of what you were going to spend on. Could you maybe highlight some of the areas to spend, and kind of initiatives that might be different year-over-year? And then -- yes, so that, and then also just any other kind of normalization of spending that might be factored in in terms of travel and spending around kind of the macro and COVID related expenses.",1.0094689,0.963
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,34,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Sure, Dan. Happy to take that one. So on the expense guidance, we tried to give you the pieces, it's easier to explain in the two pieces, which is the organic growth and then the the Regulatory Reporting Hub overlay on top of that. I'd say, we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGRs. If you look at the expense CAGR over the past five or ten years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history. And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders will continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece we, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path.",0.552079,0.929
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,35,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really head count driven. You think about the 80 or so people that we added in 2020. We have plans to add another 60 or so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021, so it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase. The other piece, you look at -- and this will be along the investment theme. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in Trading protocols and the platform, and specifically it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items. And I'd give you two other items just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now in our models we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers.",0.3828736,0.906
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,36,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The other one, just to give you a little bit of color. We are expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just two minutes on that because there's two components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit, and then you have clearing costs related to US treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat. The savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the UK, those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in US Treasury -- and an increase in US treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady state savings from the transitioning in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset.

I had a question on automated trading but Chris covered it so well I can skip it. So I'll go right to the other -- the long-winded answer that Tony had. On the self-clearing, you mentioned that you reduce it by, I thought you said a third. But I thought that percentage, I thought it was like -- it's running at 12% of Open Trading revenue right now, and I thought that could cut in half. And just trying to understand why -- it doesn't seem like we saw any impact in this quarter and I thought we ramped or started to launch it in August. And where are we at as we enter the new year in regards to fully have all the capital in place etcetera?",0.0872787,0.917
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,41,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So, Rich -- and I'm happy to answer the follow-on question on this. And really you need to look at the clearing cost in two pieces. And we have the cost associated with clearing Open Trading corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the US, transition to the settlement agent in the UK. And that's why we've been talking about a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of a third. But the second component -- and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction. The second component is clearing costs for US treasury trading where market access intermediates those trades. In the near term we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries runs somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term. But you have to look at those two pieces.",0.3330589,0.815
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,42,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, in the fourth quarter -- and admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing costs. So for example as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit, clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running -- the prior year was a little a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledge that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses, third-party clearing cost expenses for credit. We believe that the savings will be upwards on a -- of a third on a steady state basis whether you look at it as a percentage of open trading revenue, on a per ticket basis, on a per million traded basis, we are still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with -- again with -- we have 2 elements to our clearing cost, both corporate bonds, and then on the treasury side.",0.5815018,0.947
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,43,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Rich, just to complete that thought, if you look at our self-clearing it's fully converted in the US across our products and OT. So we're fully up and running. Our conversion in Europe is targeted for the end of the first quarter. And then with regard to our treasury platform, anything that we recently launched, as I mentioned our Click to Trade solutions and our integrated Rates trading platform, that all comes through our self-clearing solution today. So growth in rates in 2021 as part of our new offering -- our unique new offering, will be self-cleared. We're also looking at our third-party clearing relationships and -- with regard to our current DDD platform and we continue to look at optionality whether we want to self clear and when.

Just going back to 2020 on our Rates business, we launched auto hedging which is really a dealer solution to protect dealers on their hedging capability. Net hedging was launched late in the fourth quarter and rolled out on a pilot basis. It is now go live in Q1. And we're seeing obviously a long list of clients that have had interest in that net hedging solution for some time. So the client take up should roll out here in the first and second quarter with additional enhancements to net hedging over the first half of the year. With regard to the fully live Rates solution, couple of movements there. I think one of the more exciting things is our integrated trading solution, fully Click to Trade liquid streams and both on the run. And more importantly, our very unique off the run streaming solution, which really no other platforms have streaming off the runs to institutional clients. So that's new as part of our offering.

Looking at both of EM and especially Munis, they have low level of electronification, limited data and transparency.

But I'm glad you pointed out two enormous growth opportunities for us and we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020 and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead. And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there is a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know the Muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world. So Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value, where we can connect all market participants into our all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade. EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic, and global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM but 26 local markets all on one marketplace with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all our Open Trading.

We are seeing really good client take up going on there and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large and Munis and global EM are just two of many examples that we're looking at right now. And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top five banks alone had global FICC revenue of $68 billion. Market access had a record year at about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see is the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity, and that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business.",0.0027473,0.0

Just wanted to circle back to some of the commentary earlier around automated trading. Hearing that the size of the trades going through there is increasing. Just curious if you could add any color on the block size penetration, where that is now, how that's evolving and how you might be able to increase the block penetration on the automated trading side even further, whether it's in terms of new protocols in innovation, just how you're thinking about that?",0.3516484,0.936
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,54,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. And again, the automated trading solution has been largely adopted by clients for small ticket solution. It hasn't been targeted for larger ticket. However, as we think about developing the automated suite of products, our target is for block trades, particularly when you start to integrate both Auto Responder which is the ability to provide liquidity to other parties who were requesting price, and Auto-X. And putting together those products into a single suite or a single order similar to a client algorithm would allow larger block quarters to provide liquidity throughout the day, and then Auto-X at the end of the day. So both, be a liquidity provider and a liquidity taker all in one automated solution. Those are some of the targets that we have in 2021 as part of the initiatives around automation. But today as we see the current client experience, the execution quality for trades somewhere around $2 million in size is quite similar to anything $5 million in size.

Just curious to hear your updated thoughts there, and if it changed at all just given that we've just seen tremendous growth in high-yield electronic trading last year.

This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess seeing the inflection point in high yield during the course of 2020. But I'd point to a number of things, it's the size of our Open order trading -- open trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading, and the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution of the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving. I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients, is through the MarketAxess system.

So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go. The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last three or four quarters is that a year ago, the bulk of our activity in high yield was really in $1 million in under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we are really pleased with the results, but we think there is a long way to go. We are 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means.

Just another big picture question to kind of follow up on that last one. I know market share is going to vary in any given year based on the conditions in the market, but over let's say a five year horizon at this stage, what is your expectation for your market share gains in high-grade and high-yield given the acceleration we saw in 2020?",0.0032051,0.989
MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,61,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I just think that there are many favorable macro trends that are working their way through the global credit markets and leading to very positive market share trends on MarketAxess. And I've mentioned them briefly earlier, but the growth in ETF funds under management is driving a lot of activity in the underlying bonds. It's creating a lot of relative value trading activity between the ETF shares in the underlying bond market. Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in blocked both transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see five years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next five to ten years is likely to be electronic.

We witnessed that in 2020 and we expect that to continue. So as the electronic piece of the market grows, and certainly people in the industry forecast they can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge fund -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform and that -- we've seen those entries in other asset classes where turnover does increase.

And then we obviously see activity on our platform as a result of those trades. I think one area of evidence that we're benefiting from some of the block trades aside from just our overall block trade growth rate and then IG block trading were up 11% in Q4. It's just our dealer RFQ initiative that we really were pushing throughout 2020 has seen exceptional growth where dealers are coming to us for liquidation of positions. And largely those liquidations are as a result of a larger block trade that was done and they have either pieces of that trade that they are unloading or other pieces of a portfolio that they are liquidating. So really our dealer RFQ growth rate and in Q4 in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume and overall dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020.

I think I said a year ago that I loved Munis, and if you look at our performance in Munis in 2020 we're more excited about the opportunity in 2021 given our growth rate. We had a record day for Munis and in January just recently, so continue around that . Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help point clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a time to auto execution later in the day. So they can still see the success of the position getting executed but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day. Features where we're providing own masses with trades.

And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it still expected to be an active year. On any normal basis, it was just last year was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. So we would temper our views on new issues secondary trading activity this year relative to last. But we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that.

And we had new data sales last year with about $6.5 million, it was about 5.5 million the year before that, we've got a pretty good pipeline entering 2021. But I would reiterate what we've said in the past around data that we're also using data to incent clients to trade more on the platform, and that's a a principal use of the content that we're capturing. So we expect to grow the info services revenue double digits. But again, it is an important piece of the information we're delivering and to help clients make make pricing decisions.",1.6597985,0.637

We gave some color in the third quarter. Take that piece. It's somewhere around $1 million per month in revenue is what we're expecting, maybe a little bit higher than that what we're expecting in 2021. On the organic side, we're expecting double-digit growth on the organic side and it's really a full year impact of SFTR reporting which came online midway through 2020. And it's also, we've been adding clients organically. So that -- the combination of those two items, we think we're looking at double-digit organic growth, overlay Regulatory Reporting Hub $1 million or so in revenue a month and that gives you a sense for what we're expecting for 2021.",0.1117216,0.765

MKTX-2020-Q4-2021-01-27,84,Answer,2021-01-27,4,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, happy to take that. I think it's early days in the new regulatory structure in Europe post-Brexit in terms of where this all lands. Clearly MiFID II included some commentary on consolidated trade tape. I would start by saying we are big fans of market transparency. We think the transparency increases participation and creates a fair marketplace, and Europe is lacking some of that transparency today. So we are supportive of transparency improving in the region. We obviously with our Reg reporting and our e-trading business, have a substantial amount of transaction data and we do think we have a role to play, but it's not exactly clear yet where this will all land. I think, we'll learn more about it over the next year or two, and it will take time before anything is implemented.

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Great question, I appreciate your question on the Green bond initiative, because it's something we worked closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the Green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients, we certainly made Green Bonds much more available on the platform. The nice thing about this solution is we were planting trees for every million dollars of Green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well, and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. Green Bonds and really ESG related bond saw a record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our Green Bond trading for tree solution.

So they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. There is another initiative that's related and I think it's worth mentioning, because it cuts across many of our products and that's our diversity dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting, because it really solved some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG.

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,38,Question,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"I guess my question is around automation, and great results on the Open Trading and as well as the automated trading. And I guess my question is around market data and I've heard from past panels and from calls, the importance of market data to continue to grow the automated trading. And so could you give us an update, either Rick or Chris on the market data offering and how important it is and I'd also like to find out why Chris hasn't wrestled more this $312 million of savings from Open Trading back to MarketAxess?",,0.9
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,39,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I was planning on talking about that savings, Rich, because it's unbelievable that a company of our size can deliver that much savings in a quarter where the savings actually dwarfs our revenues. So when clients see that savings, obviously, they are migrating to the platform. But to answer your question directly, you're absolutely right, Rich. Market data is a key component of automation. If you look at all the automation innovations, both here at MarketAxess and elsewhere in the industry, this highly dependent on very solid, accurate market data and price information. And it has to be real time in order for the automation to truly succeed.",0.3521062,0.952

So, that is a critical part of our automation strategy, both in terms of how to price the instrument as a guide for clients but also as risk parameters to protect them against large market moves while they have automation launch.

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,45,Question,2020-07-22,2,2020,Jeremy Campbell,Barclays,"Thanks for the update on the capability side of the algo. Maybe this is from both Rick and Chris here. Obviously, it seems like Open Trading and trade automation are kind of critical to the market share gains that you guys have had here today. It looks like both the number of firms, as well as the volumes went higher. So, I guess from a client perspective, given the unique working circumstances that we're in doing the virus. Can you maybe just give us some color on the outlook for cementing both Open Trading and automation into trading work flows from maybe both a new user and deepening wallet share perspective? And then also just kind of wondering if you see any slackening engagements in either of these systems this past month or so since some large dealers and asset managers have had traders move back into the office?",0.6875,0.943
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,46,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I'm happy to start and quick Chris can follow up as well. But the beauty of our Open Trading solution is its simplicity. And we've really leveraged the broad base of institutional order flow that we have on the platform to create an open network where more people can participate in that order flow. And, I do think that the share gains first half of this year are largely attributable to the benefits that we see from the open marketplace; first, the cost savings that we've mentioned; and secondly, by expanding market participation.",0.1460623,0.966
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,47,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And virtually every quarter we see growing activity from a growing base of alternative market makers who are committing new capital to the credit markets. We see growing activity from ETF market participants. It's interesting to note when you look at the second quarter, ETF high yield share trading was up 52%, very close to our own overall trading growth. So, we're growing hand in glove with the ETF industry as well. And that base of market participants has been enabled for a new way of trading through Open Trading.",0.4391026,0.957
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,48,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're also starting to see very positive signs from quantitative fund strategies, which historically have not been active in credit. And then finally, I'd point to growth that we're seeing in the hedge fund client segment, which is relatively new as well. So, when you look at the volume and share gains for the first half of the year, it is a very healthy combination of more volume with existing clients and new entrants into credit markets, which also then drives our optimism about market turnover. On your other point about work from home, there's no question that that has created a tailwind for electronic trading just out of necessity. Moving away from trading floors into a home office, it's much easier to connect with global liquidity electronically than it is any other way.",0.1254579,0.973
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,49,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"However, given the results that we're delivering to our clients, we personally don't see that going back to where it was as clients return to their office environments. And this quarter, we do see some gradual return among dealers to their trading floors. Although, it's still at relatively low levels but asset managers continue to trade primarily from home. And our belief based on lots of conversations is that that is likely to stay with us through the second half of this year.",0.0283883,0.402

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","If you look at the size of the credit market and how large its recently grown, the challenges continue to get more complicated to source liquidity and to execute both large and small sized trades. So, the work flow demands certainly are leading to a higher adoption rate of our automation solutions, both our Auto-X and our Auto Responder.

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,54,Question,2020-07-22,2,2020,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Maybe just a question on the fed primary and secondary market corporate bond facilities. Just when we're thinking about the direct and indirect impact from these. I guess first question, have you seen any fed buying directly on your platform? I'm not sure if that's happening for the dealers or BlackRock or something else. And then on just the fed facilities more broadly and in an indirect way. Do you think they're already helping to compress credit spreads and credit spread volatility? And if so, could that be a headwind to market turnover and the velocity of trade?",,0.717
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,55,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Kyle, I'll take a crack at that. But first of all, we would never comment on any individual client activity on our platform. So, we don't have the liberty to answer your question about fed activity electronically and I would refer you to your corporate bond trading desk and others for further color on that. I think the fed has had an active role in the recovery of credit markets over the last four months. Most importantly, the short-term liquidity programs back in March and early April that unlock financing markets that really started the march toward more normal credit spreads that we observed throughout the second quarter.",0.360348,0.917
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,56,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"What you see in the media is consistent with our understanding is that the fed has been active in both ETFs and corporate bonds but the levels are not outsized. And the reality is that with the changes in the liquidity and financing markets, the credit markets did a really good job recovering themselves. And asset managers saw inflows through the quarter that they were putting to work, which caused credit spreads to compress significantly throughout the quarter.",0.0769231,0.945
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,57,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think the fed is there when needed. It's clear that they have a vested interest in the capital markets and the cost of funding through this crisis, and they've had an impact on helping credit markets get back on their feet, which then allowed corporations to issue $700 billion in high-grade debt in one quarter. So, they definitely have made a difference there. With respect to secondary trading, I don't think their activity has been outsized versus normal market participants.",0.0485348,0.827

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,59,Question,2020-07-22,2,2020,Ari Ghosh,,"Maybe just looking back to your comments around Open Trading. The value prop right now around liquidity cost saves that's fairly playing out nicely and driving rather auto activity, share gains and new firms from the platforms. So we already seen that. And I think you touched on this a little. But curious if you can just bar some of these recent share gains? How much of this is more environmental driven that could potentially dissipate on a more normal backdrop versus greater utilization from either under penetrated clients or regions, be it [Audio interrupted] participation, APAC something like that that could end up being a lot more sticky. So, just trying to ascertain if these elevated levels should be viewed almost as higher reset level driven by diversity going forward with the platform?",,0.954
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,60,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's a good point. There's no question that the cost savings from Open Trading benefited from extreme volatility during the quarter, and the much wider price dispersion the clients observed in levels coming back on order flow in any form. So, I do think that the cost savings will ebb and flow based on volatility and price dispersion in each quarter. Having said that, we are confident that our Open Trading marketplace is unique. 95% of the order flow that I mentioned comes from institutional order flow and about 5% from dealer-initiated orders, and that's creating a tremendous opportunity for not only alternative market makers but also for institutional investors to find more matching opportunities per day and drive their transaction cost down on a consistent basis.",0.297619,0.83
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,61,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we do believe that this is a long-term benefit to fixed income market structure. And it's great to see dealers embracing it more actively as well for their own liquidity with the levels of dealer initiated order flow where they can end up transacting either with an end client or another dealer on those orders. And it's nice to see that the profitability of MarketAxess is growing while at the same time, the dealers had very good quarters as well, which reflects how big these markets are. And we do think that longer term you're going to continue to see market share gains and increased market participation that will deliver transaction cost savings back to our clients for many years to come.",0.2271062,0.98

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,66,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we are seeing our biggest users continue to grow their order sizes on the platform. Obviously, I mentioned the launch of a client algo sometime in the second half of the year, that tool is also designed to take larger size orders and break them up into smaller size orders to allow clients to while trade a large size to do it over the course of the day or week in much smaller trade sizes.

What we are seeing on auto execution with investor clients is mirrored with the dealer community and the increase in size through their algos. So, I do think it reflects confidence in trading automation in the system and it makes both dealers and investors more efficient interacting with order flow on the platform. And in addition to the increase in trade size through Auto-X, it was also interesting through the credit event in Q2 that our overall trade size in U.S. credit increased during the quarter and we had a record quarter for block trading volume.",0.7788086,0.944

But the market share gains were, we experienced market share gains across all trade sizes and all maturities. And when you look at, if we just broke it up between block trading and non block trading. On the block side, our market share was up about 2.3 percentage points and our overall market share was up at 2.8 percentage points, and then the non block was also up about 2.8 percentage points.

Again, you had some pretty impressive market share gains in the quarter, especially on the back of a lot of new issues that came out during the quarter. So kind of by our back, it looks like your market share of new issued bond rating was actually higher than in prior years. I'm wondering one, if that's correct?

It's a little bit later than what we have anticipated but probably understandable, given the pandemic impact on us and on our vendor partners. What we're doing is once we do go live in the third quarter, we do expect clearing costs as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for our credit business to decline.

And typically, clearing costs on the credit side as a percentage of Open Trading revenue have been 11% or 12%, and we do think we could drive that down to the single-digit. It's even more important today because if you look at Open Trading revenue in 2019, our credit revenue was about $100 million. If it goes down, for example, 3 percentage points, that's $3 million in savings. If you look at the first half of this year and we're on $170 million run rate for Open Trading revenue.

MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,90,Question,2020-07-22,2,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"I just want to get back to the, sort of the impact of issuance in the quarter. And Tony, you've done and I think this sort of mentioned earlier, but a calculation that sort of removes the issuance and sort of normalizes what the market share excluding the issuance. And could you go through that and what you calculate 2Q as? And then also maybe one last thing, the variable fee capture, and it's elevated because of the longer duration. Would you expect that to fall back somewhere between say this quarter and the first quarter? Is that a reasonable rate going forward? How would you view the variable fee capture?",,0.601
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,91,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So Rich, I can't say I did a whole little science project here on what market share would look with and without the new issues. But well, this is what I can tell you is, when you look at the proportion of TRACE volume that related to newly issued bonds. And let's just take the second quarter. If you look at just the first four weeks of trading, it was about a quarter of TRACE volume related to newly issued bonds.",1.8691406,0.802
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,92,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And if you look for any period prior to that it may have been 10% or 11% or 12%. So clearly, the portion of the market related to newly issued bonds increased dramatically. And you look at our market share, our market share gains year-over-year were up, for high grade were up 2.8 percentage points. And again, without getting too scientific, if you've pulled out the new issue piece, you would see our market share gains would have been even healthier. On one of the earlier questions that Rick responded to on did our market share go up in newly issued bonds? It did, not appreciably. But if you look at the first four weeks, our market share is typically around 5% or 6%. It was up a little bit but not a lot. So, you see when you do the math around a big increase in the portion of the market that relates to newly issued bonds the market share gains were even healthier.",2.2519531,0.95
MKTX-2020-Q2-2020-07-22,93,Answer,2020-07-22,2,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And just on the variable fee capture, there is so many factors and this particularly for high grade that we're talking about. The fee capture for high yield euro bond emerging markets very stable and not duration impacted at all. It's the U.S. high grade plan where it is dependent on trade size. It is dependent on duration, which is years to maturity and yield. It's dependent on protocol. So, there is a lots of factors that can move it. The item we flagged was on years to maturity. You look over the past 10 years now, the years to maturity is ranged between seven years and 10 years. We're not at the absolute high. We're in the middle of that range, it did extend out a little bit in the second quarter here. Hard to say what will happen going forward.",1.8125,0.42

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We've given some color in the past that and this is just, if you look it, all else equal, one year change in maturity could move the fee capture by something like $10 to $15 per million. So, if we move from say nine to 10 years, all else equal, fee capture move up, going from nine to eight years fee captures would move down.

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Kyle, it was much more on the years to maturity, because even though, you're right that yields were lower, spreads were higher, so -- where treasury yields were lower, spread to treasury was higher. So it was much more about the years to maturity. Anything we had a slightly negative offset because we did better in larger trade sizes. Not only our market share was up in larger trade sizes, the average trade size moved up as well.

We do look at the ETF participants, and typically this is going back over the past five years. The ETF participants for our high yield business have ranged between 15% to 30% of our business. That 30% actually, you may recall, it was the blowout of the energy sector going back almost five years ago now. In the second quarter, that percentage was below 20%.

And a number of new participants have come onto the platform. And obviously, we launched an effort late last year to target systematic fund strategies and they do make use of ETF arbitrage strategies and other signal based strategies.

So, we're pretty excited about the dealer feedback on the Dealer Direct Streaming tool. And what's great about it is, it allows dealers to customize streaming liquidity direct to a disclosed client.

Obviously, it leverages APIs for the dealers. So, it's a fairly streamlined set up for them.

I guess I believe Chris said April-to-date was up 35% year-over-year. If that - and just making sure that's correct, but if it is, just wanting to get sort of the open trading percentage and I think he said that algo responses had gone back to pre-crisis levels. So does that speak to open trading as well?",,0.535

In - yes, you did hear my comments correctly for April volumes. We have seen liquidity stabilize across the market in April and we have seen consistent market share of our open trading platform. As you are well aware liquidity in March was much like toilet paper was hard to find but OT or open trading solution clearly was a critical part of the ecosystem throughout the March crisis. And so its market share did increase, but relative to the first quarter we continue to see open trading perform at quite high levels in terms of the overall volume on the platform, but even across individual assets like minis, like EM and other products; so continued to see robust performance in the open trading solution.",0.5844727,0.966
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,33,Question,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"So I guess I interpret that as the open trading percentage of volume is similar to 1Q on the percentage basis? And I guess, and the last...",,0.0
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,34,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,I would just say it's actually similar to March levels. So we still have very high credit market spread volatility and that is creating an important layer of new liquidity through open trading and the open trading percentage of our volume is actually closer to March levels.,1.404304,0.708
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,35,Question,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Wow. That's impressive. And then my follow-up would be, yet the Fed stepping in and just trying to get to see whether you can sort of parse out sort of the impacts, did that - how does the Fed stepping in? Improved liquidity and improved volumes during the month that carried over and I know there was a lot of new issuance at the end of the quarter. So that probably is trading in the secondary market more freely now, so just trying to parse out sort of the impacts of those two things on volumes?",,0.951
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,36,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, sure. Happy too. I think the Fed's initial focus was on short-term funding markets and the liquidity programs where we're generally focused on repo and other short-term funding markets to make sure that they were functioning properly. It's our understanding that they continue to make preparations to be able to participate actively in the primary and secondary corporate bond markets and the ETF markets for fixed income shares. We are not certain that any of that has started yet, but we believe that they're making their preparations to be able to do so. So right now, in terms of the bond activity, I don't think that is directly related to the Fed, but they obviously had a material impact and improving liquidity conditions in the short-term financing markets.",1.6282051,0.897
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,37,Question,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,So do you think that with all the volumes in - at least on - while the volumes in appositive more driven by the incremental volumes by the issuance?,,0.0
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,38,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think that they're driven by ongoing credit spread volatility. Credit markets bottomed out around March 23rd and fortunately credit spreads have been narrowing and we've retraced about half the move over the four weeks since the lows. And it is - these are unbelievable new issue numbers and we were up around 250 billion in new issuance in March most of it in the last 10 days of the month and it looks like we're going to be even higher than that in April. And that those are remarkable new issue numbers as, as corporations are really tapping the high grade market in particular to create more liquidity on their balance sheet. But to put that in context, a good month for high grade new issuance is normally a bit over $100 billion, this will be the second month in a row that we've been up at around $250 billion. And for you and others that have been following us for a long time, you'll know that when new issuance is high you normally see some short-term dip in our share. That has not been the case in March and April. So I think it speaks very well to the long-term trend in market share on the MarketAxess system that share has remained high even though new issue levels are so robust.",1.6955128,0.98

I guess following up on that last portion, just trying to desegregate some of the long-term structural changes that continue to be at your benefit versus the near term benefits of spread widening. And so you gave some good stats around price improvement and activity. I guess, if you could just elaborate in terms of how you're thinking about either new customers that have been interacting with your venue or how we can think about kind of - at some level of normalization and one thing I think would be interesting is, the work from home environment, one of the dynamics around adoption of electronic trading has been behavioral from a user perspective. I'm wondering if you think this is sort of a kick start or a catalyst around some of that.",,0.953

But in March, was a really interesting month because we started the month with all of the major dealers and major investment managers trading off their main trading floors. And by the middle of the month everyone was trading from home. And I think it's personally remarkable that TRACE volumes grew the way that they did and MarketAxess volumes grew the way they did through that difficult transition. And I do think the work from home environment puts a premium on electronic trading. It's just easier to access the entire market from home using electronic venues. And I do think that that was one of the reasons for uplift in share and volume on our system. We expect that to last through most of the second quarter when we look at the plans to return back to main headquarters and trading floors.",1.4647436,0.949

So I think this quarter will be a full quarter of work from home. Third quarter will be a little bit of mix of both as people test getting back into their main offices. But what we saw in March and carrying into April is that our volume gains were a very healthy mix of more volume from existing clients and new clients using the system for the first time, and not only new firms but new individual trading users within existing firms. And the net result was in March, we had a new record in terms of the total number of active trading firms and a new record in terms of total active individual trading users. So we're really seeing this as an inflection point where more firms and more individuals are taking advantage of the efficiency of electronic trading as well as the transaction cost savings that are available.",0.6533883,0.956

And obviously BlackRock is a very large user of the MarketAxess' electronic platform. I'm just kind of wondering if you guys are seeing any disproportionate part of the Fed purchase flow through the electronic venue, either on, you know, a first order level, like BlackRock Fed purchasing cash bonds themselves to the electronic venue or maybe through a second order level, like the Fed purchases of credit ETFs or the underlying oddlot baskets might trade through electronic pipes?",0.4764785,0.893

There's also more credit spread dispersion than we've seen a long time across different sectors and across different issuers and that leads to more trading activity. So our expectation is that, you're going to have higher levels of credit spread volatility than we expected throughout this year and combined with active new issuance and that combination is likely to keep market trading volumes elevated throughout the balance of the year.",1.5654762,0.865

Obviously as you could see from our prepared remarks, our employees were phenomenal throughout the COVID crisis in their ability to migrate to home office, while maintaining high levels of performance and even in some situations improving their overall performance that we've seen. And so we are on track across all of our initiatives for 2020. There are a couple initiatives where we're relying on some third parties that are likely going to be slightly delayed.

Our hedging which went live in Q4 is continues to roll out. We have several dealers already live and a robust pipeline of dealer's right behind them. Our integration of the liquidity - the formerly known LiquidityEdge platform into our institutional business is underway as well. Our first phase of that integration begins at the end of May where we will have institutional clients trading through the MarketAxess network, the MarketAxess broker-dealer into the Rates platform.

The data business had great success in the first quarter as well. We've launched a treasury composite product and CP Plus, our pre-trade analytical tool continues to grow. So right now I think the only impact that we're seeing from the crisis and the pandemic is really a slight delay in our self clearing project, largely due to our reliance on third parties as we roll that project out.

First is just on the U.S. Treasury market, there's a lot of press around liquidity in the U.S. cash treasury market in late March. The dealers kind of stepped back from providing liquidity, especially in off-the-runs. Just wondering, if your experience in the U.S. credit markets with open trading being a real solution to the market as dealers stepped away? Did that experience make you more confident? That's some form of all-to-all trading solution could eventually be successful in U.S. cash treasuries?",,0.966

And so it was an unusual liquidity event for the treasury market. We did however on our rates platforms see market share increase because we think the unique liquidity solutions that our platform provides. It's not a traditional club. It does allow for customized liquidity provision both for dealer and for clients. So we do think that, that model is the future of the liquid product market.

We do expect that an all-to-all solution that does allow you to customize liquidity for rates would be a very viable solution as we go forward.

On the investment grade side, you know there's lots of different factors that influence the investment-grade fee capture. You've got a year's maturity where yields are trade size matters under our tiered fee plan. Dealer mix matters whether dealers are on distribution fee plans or all variable plans. At times, floating rate note activity also matters. But when you look at it - you look at it sequentially, the fee capture was up $5 from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, a years-to-maturity we're a little bit longer and less than a half of the year longer there was no impact from changes in the size buckets. There was a little bit of dealer mix change there. So it really was all about years-to-maturity.",1.3240016,0.103

But again, that was all duration related. It was longer years-to-maturity, on average lower yields. Going forward and on the April numbers, what I tell you on, on April right now is not just for investment grade, but looking across the Board. It's early in the quarter right now. There are lots of factors that I just mentioned that could influence fee capture, but if you're looking at April activities, there is not a lot to report on any variance of note at any product, not only investment grade but for high yield, emerging markets, Eurobonds, right now the fee capture all looks similar to the first quarter.

The number of client firms that are providing liquidity on the system continues to grow and we think that's the differentiator. When you have volatility like we had in the last five weeks of the quarter, the more trading connections you have, the better off you will be in terms of sourcing liquidity and reducing transaction costs. So we had a record during the quarter of over 900 firms that provided liquidity on the MarketAxess system. The vast majority of those over 700 were asset managers. So this is where we think we're making a big difference is that when markets get to these sorts of stress levels, our technology connects investors and dealers all around the world and the best price can come from anywhere.",1.7504579,0.943

So we think that this as an important quarter in terms of the advancement of all-to-all trading. And clearly the transaction cost savings that were approximately three times greater than the average quarter in 2019 validate the value of what we're doing and create behavioral changes, because the pricing during the stressful days oftentimes were just so significantly better than what clients were able to find through other means.

I was hoping to peel back the layers a little bit on the trading activity that you saw in the course of margin, maybe what you're seeing today in terms of the average trade size both on the IG side and the high yield side.

You're looking at the market share gains where we're obviously pretty healthy year-over-year and those market share gains were across all trade sizes and all maturity buckets.

MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,78,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Good question, Alex, happy to take that one. Two things, when you have a period like we're seeing currently with more downgrades than we've seen in a long time and fallen angels, it does create trading opportunity. Those bonds oftentimes have to come out of investment grade portfolios and move into high yield or crossover portfolios or insurance portfolios that have the flexibility to operate in either place.",1.834707,0.939
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,79,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it's good for overall trading activity and yes, at the margin as large high grade issuers slide into high yield and begin to trade on price not spread that is also positive for our fee capture. And you can see from the first quarter volumes by product, high yield was the standout, volumes were up nearly 30% overall, but high yield more like 70%. So that's where the standout has been. We're taking share there and high yield volumes have been robust. This two is something I would expect to carry on throughout the year.",1.6630037,0.93
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,80,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We have not had an active period of default concerns in nearly 10 years; there really hasn't been a distressed market, large concerns about defaults until we got into this crisis earlier in the first quarter. So this is a very different credit market than what we expected when we started the year in January. And I do think for a host of reasons, that it will require more risk transfer, which leads to secondary trading. And I think we'll also continue to bring out the importance of all-to-all trading to source liquidity from any place in the world.",1.6071429,-0.803

Maybe most of the questions have been answered, but maybe just to follow on the issuance question in the market share. Yes, obviously the market share tends to dip when new issuance is heavy. And appreciate your comments about the calendar likely remaining pretty intense. But is there any way to - in this environment assess what kind of headwind do you think that is on your market share? In other words, if that did normalize, how much your market share would increase, and the underlying question there is how much is the - is sort of the permanent changes that you think might occur in electronification of trading the underlying growth of that actually increasing and being masked by the new issuance, having new issuances?",,0.985
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,84,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It varies and there are so many factors that come into play in terms of overall market volume as well as the electronic share volume that it does vary, but more often than not when you get a new issue as high as it's been the last couple of months, you also see the block trading percentage of TRACE grow and our share can be 1%, 2% lower during those months before those bonds are distributed and start trading with the rest of the secondary market over the following three or four weeks.",1.6895604,-0.25
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,85,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we do feel really good about March and April share expense, given that new issue activity is well above anyone's expectations for the pace that we would be on this year. It's clear that, there's a transition going on with institutional client behavior, 95% of our order flow is initiated by institutional customers. And when we look at our institutional share of TRACE for high grade, for institutional customer volume, it's now up around 24%.

Wanted to build on, so you guys had a lot of success with Open Trading during the quarter, we also had that exposed in new issuance activity, but I kind of thought something like live markets which was supposed to build on the Open Trading activity could help maybe kind of get you guys into a little bit more flow on the new issuance as it kind of gets into the secondary market there. I was hoping to comment, I know that's still early days, but maybe kind of the recent activity you've seen in the market has helped some clients along getting live markets kind of going on their platform or if you're seeing any increased interest because of that.

So live markets which we were piloting in the first quarter late fourth quarter, obviously we've been focused on on-boarding dealers to provide their streams. That process obviously is a bit of a setback given the current crisis, but what we have seen is a number of our clients, as Rick mentioned looking to provide liquidity, seeking methods and techniques for providing liquidity, live markets is an obvious solution for them to provide liquidity because they can join the bid side or the offer side of that market.

MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,94,Question,2020-04-29,1,2020,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. There's a lot of press, especially in late March around HYG and some other bond ETFs that were trading at pretty significant discounts to their NAVs in today, what could have been made worse due to the lack of liquidity at that time. Just wondering if you think the regulators will be looking at the bond DTF market in the wake of this in terms of maybe putting certain liquidity requirements on underlying holdings or something of that nature or do you think that's going to be low on the priority list for regulators?",,0.361
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,95,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So happy to take that one, I guess I have a different perspective on the ETF performance during extremely volatile times, it's important to remember that the credit market is so fragmented and there are so many unique issues that oftentimes in my opinion what you were seeing was that the, the bond NAVs were behind not the ETF share price.",0.5600586,0.758
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,96,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So when you've got 7,000, 8,000 different bonds in an ETFs and anyone with a real time pricing mechanism is dealing with the level of volatility that we had during March, those prices are whipping around. There's an actual transaction taking place between two parties when the share is trade. And in my opinion, that's the best form of price discovery is an actual transaction. And when you look at the major ETF fixed income shares in March, it's a great story for risk transfer and market liquidity, share volumes were up over a 100% in the major fixed income shares and up over 70% for the full quarter. So I actually think that the ETF market held up incredibly well, it was part of the liquidity solution, not part of the liquidity problem.",1.3393555,0.957
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,97,Answer,2020-04-29,1,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And I think, you're, you're seeing very clearly this new liquidity model evolve where ETF share trading is definitely part of the fabric for the institutional fixed income market now, almost all dealers and investors are using ETF shares as a way to transfer risk when they need it. They clearly did that in March. Portfolio trading held up well in March and that's another way to transfer risk and of course all-to-all trading is providing an essential layer of liquidity for all market participants as well. So I think it was a great indication that the reason the TRACE volumes were able to grow in March when they fell so sharply in 2008 is because all of those liquidity tools were at work during the crisis, ETF shares, portfolio trading and all-to-all trading through MarketAxess, Open Trading. That's why market volumes were able to go up and clients and dealers were able to transfer the risk that they needed to during those chaotic weeks.",1.1826172,0.84
MKTX-2020-Q1-2020-04-29,98,Question,2020-04-29,1,2020,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Thanks. And then maybe a second question for Tony. Obviously it's been a really strong volume environment to start the year and especially through April, over 35% year-over-year growth, if we see similar type volume growth for the remainder of the year and that 30% type range. Just wondering how you think about the expense guide and where that leaves you in terms of the current expense guide from when you started the year, because I think there's multiple things. Obviously the volumes are going to push up certain areas of expenses, but then the COVID-19 impact specifically; maybe that reduces TNE in some other areas of expenses. So just wondering how we should kind of put those pieces together, because any help there that'd be great. Thank you.",,0.963

The fact that we didn't say anything in the prepared remarks about the expense guidance, you can probably assume from that, we're still expecting the expenses to be within that original guidance range of $297 million to $314 million. But under this scenario, you suggest there or propose, if market volumes for the balance of the year were consistent with the first quarter, we could be near the high-end of that guidance range. And I would tell you that that would be good news. And we've got a number of variabilities in there, so people; we've got a fairly healthy hiring plan as we entered 2020.",0.8797859,0.891

If that continued that would be good news. If that expense line item is running higher than expectations. Same thing with clearing costs, we clearing costs doubled year-over-year and that's because open trading volume was up massively and we had a great quarter in treasuries as well. So those clearing costs are running higher than expectations that's all good news. So I would suggest that if we hit that high-end of the range, it also likely means that that topline performance, topline revenue growth is higher than expectations as well.",0.8855496,0.963

There has been a significant increase [in algo] generated price responses over the last two years.

We get excellent advice from them on protocols and things what they believe would work well in the market and the piece that's also an important part for both of us is the integration with the Latin client network.

So I guess the first question is on the fee per million and China understand and sort of the pricing dynamics. Can you give us any you know if rates continue to go up, with the different moving parts and you sort of outlined what moves the rate per million. How would you expect it to generally play out. Is it a general trend? If you looked over the last you know [Indiscernible] turned it down. If you looked way back before rates went down to zero, you know the high grade was significantly less so, so any scenario analysis that you've done that sort of can help us think about the rates going forward?",,0.897
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,65,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Rich, we can. And I said three big items in the prepared remarks around trade size, duration and the dealer choice on the fee plan. And at times we've given some guidance or rule of thumb on how to look at those variables and you just to put in perspective. The yields movements is probably the least important of those three items, so if you had a for example, a one percentage point change across the yield curve, that could equate to something like $10 or $15 per million and that's all out equal that would give a rule of thumb or sensitivity around the yield change. When I say the bigger pieces they're probably - they are probably around maturity and even the dealer mix has a big influence.",1.140387,0.751
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,66,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"On the maturity side, we did see some of that impact in the first quarter where yes the maturity came in almost one year versus the fourth quarter. Every year the maturity could be $10 or $15 per million as well, so you have some influence there. I would tell you this on a longer terms basis, if you look at the high water mark for fees per million for high-grade which was a little over $200 per million, by far and away the largest impact has to do with the dealer mix or the dealer choice of plans.",1.1193907,0.586
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,67,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Today we have 33 dealers on the distribution fee plan. When we hit high water mark of $205 per million, we had 22 dealers on the plan. So, if you recall there's a just a geography switched in where we have more fees coming through distribution fees and lower fees coming through variable fees. So longer term it's a dealer choice influence the outcome significantly. Shorter term you see those mixes around duration and around trade size as well.",1.7044051,-0.026

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,69,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"It's tough to predict what the dealers are going to do. We do provide choices in particular in U.S. high-grade and high-yield. It's tough to predict what dealers are doing. They're responding to their own forecast and projection. They're responding to the economics of our fee plan, so it's tough to predict. Every time we say we're not tracking any dealers who are going to migrate up. We get one or two, but right now we have 33 under distribution fee plan and another 40 or so on the variable plan.

And there is still some swing factors that we have going forward.

If you look at Q1 versus the expectation for the rest of the year, we do expect tech have to go up. We've been pretty at forecasting headcount for the last several years.

I guess first is on the post-trade line obviously really strong growth you realized in the first quarter. I think you mentioned that some of those may be one-time implementation fees for MiFID.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,79,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. You saw we reported was about $2.1 million increase year-over-year in post-trade in three quarters of that, that is new customers and new services related to MiFID II. So that's - the largest chunk is we do believe this repeatable. There were some implementation fees, it was around $300,000, so I would take that out, that's more one-time in non-recurring.

So you see the sort of step function increased from last year to this year that is MiFID II driven. Going forward its going to be dependent on our ability to bring new customers on line to add new services, but looking at what we have is sort of a crystal ball right now for the next several quarters, I'd narrow that - to that arrange to $4 to $4.5 million per quarter.",0.7381639,0.485

I think you said a decent portion of the 2.1% market share gain was from block trading. Looking at the charts and the slide deck it looks like about half of that in the right range.

We had market share gains across all size bucket so it wasn't that - it's a block trading.

On the block trading peaks it does vary from period to period, it is depended on duration as well, but if you were looking at over 10 million in trade size.

I think you disclosed Eurobond specifically, 13% of Eurobond volume was open trading. I thought it was lower than that maybe 5% or so last year just due to fact that buy side clients maybe weren't as comfortable using a price protocol to respond to inquiries.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,94,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So on the balance sheet, Conor, the nature of our Open Trading business today is matched principal trading using a clearing agent. It really does not influence our regulatory capital requirement. Having said that, we are consciously holding excess capital in our regulated entities, so if you look at end of March we had somewhere around $100 million of excess capital in the regulated entities and that to support open trading. I guess my counterparties up to trade through us.",0.7554549,0.402
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,95,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"If we look at estimated credit losses based on historical default models and even if we use stress environment, the output is significantly lower than the capital that's residing in the business is great now. So we're comfortable with the balance sheet position. So that even if we - and we will, this Open Trading will continue grow even at multiples than what we're trading today. We still feel that we have healthy capital position does get - help to get counterparties comfortable with our credit.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,97,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I think as our activity grows we are working on long-term solutions. We are as you know working with the settlement partner today. We would expect at some time to examine more carefully the pros and cons for self-clearing, but we would expect to be part of industry initiatives around how to improve the efficiency of trade settlement overall. And this is where I think you'll see the most progress and we would be big supporters of that clearly because we think that would be yet another benefit of greater electronic trading in the credit markets.",1.3360806,0.985

And then, I know you had been pretty clear that one of the drags on your market share gains in 2017 was some of the [e-TFR] traders had really pulled back from the market, just I'm remembering it, I think it was 40% of volume in peak and it was down to more like 20% last year.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,99,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,It is absolutely better year to-date than where we were especially through the last two or there quarters of last year. And my own view is that we are starting to see the very beginning of global quantitative easing unwinding and that is going to move more quickly over the next three or four quarters. I believe this is a significant change in the market environment versus where we have been over the last eight or nine years with consistent bond buying in all three regions from quantitative easing.,1.2399267,0.79
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,100,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And you see a very different posture from the Fed. You see important changes taking place with the ECB and the Bank of Japan also wondering whether they need to keep up this level of stimulus. That to me is a very, very important change for the market that is likely to lead the higher rates and more volatility.

The 14% what I referenced was market volume, so what we're seeing coming through trades what we're seeing coming through our Trax business across U.S. high-grade, high-yield emerging markets and Eurobonds we're seeing about 14% decline in market volumes versus the first quarter.",0.9246604,0.402
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,103,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would just add to that and tell about a week ago the direction of interest rate had reverse in first couple of months of the year, treasury 10-year yields went up about 40 basis points and then beginning and around mid March when the trade more discussions really heated up, treasury yields went the other way and credit spreads did as well. So we had a short term shift in the market environment, which also created a pause in some of the short end block activity that we have seen in Q1, obviously over the last week the direction of rates has reverse yet again and rates are moving higher, so this situation is pretty fluid but we did have a three-week period there where the market environment different than it had been through most of the first quarter.",1.3397436,0.7

But we have been peacefully co-exiting with new issue syndicate technology for the entire existence of market access beginning in 2000. And there really isn't [Indiscernible] overlap in the technology solution that's at work for underwriting in syndicate and the technology that we have invested heavily in for secondary trading.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,111,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. A large of it around the new obligations that investments managers have for regulatory reporting, and I'd say, in the near term that has been the biggest changing was the source of the client expansion that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So pretty big change, right, because previous with MiFID I the non-equity reporting requirements reside purely with the dealers. Now they include investment manages. But a lot of that work as you know was going on throughout 2017 so that everyone would be prepared to comply beginning 2018.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,112,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other part of it is around demonstrating analytical measurements for best execution. This opens up new data sales opportunities for us, which is one of the reasons that we're seeing consistent growth in data sales in Europe. The third part, the prevailing view in Europe is that any low market impact trade is better off on a regulated trading venue where the regulatory reporting obligation shift through the venue. So we think that has done an impact on trading behavior for the low market impact trades resulting in the volume increases that we reported earlier.",1.1428571,0.844

Do you guys have the ability to look at the yield curve and look at how changes the yield curve has impacted the revenue caps on the past and say, okay, given what the yield curve looks right now here's how that might impact your high-grade pricing or there just too many variables involved to really trade that analysis?",,0.718
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,114,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Patrick, there's so much of work in so many different levered that impacts fee capture and we're talking specifically about U.S. high-grade here. We could go back and look at longer term trends and look at the yield curve compared to our fixed rate fee capture as the oppose to floating rate note fee capture, you're going to see that when the yield curve is flatter, clients are trading - and if you trade shorter dated paper you're going to see the fee capture come in a little bit. I caution because you have lots of other factors that work. And I gave the sort of rule of thumb before on what movement in yield means to what and to get much more granular and isolate that we can do it, but it's probably not telling the whole story.",1.668956,-0.085

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,And even in the short-term Patrick this month is the good example of all the different moving parts being fairly complicated to predict fee capture because while the treasury cure has flatten our fee capture is actually up due to fewer block trading programs being in the market versus what we saw earlier in the year. So there are lots of moving parts and the best we could do is we fully transparent with you on how our fee model works and report on a regular basis on how they're impacting average fee capture but it is very difficult to predict one month to the next.,0.0004117,-0.175

I'm just kind of wondering if you give us any characteristic in terms of what durational profile look like this past quarter versus maybe prior peaks and prior trough, just maybe give us the kind of rule of thumb there as well. I know its been a concern for some investors in terms of moving forward that's going to revert at more normalized levels as rates revert.

MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,121,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Peak and fee capture, I mentioned it a little bit earlier, but third quarter of 2010 our U.S. high-grade fee capture was at $205 per million. At that the years to mature was about nine years and the 10-year treasury yield was about 2.9 percentage point, so not much change in the 10-year yield versus where we were in the first quarter. Here's the maturity were about a year and a half longer, so that did influence fee capture when we reported the $205 per million. The other difference would have been around our fee plan where in the first quarter this year we had more trading accruing in larger trade side. But as mentioned before by far and away the biggest difference between the peak and where we are today would be a post crisis trough, but by far and away the largest impact was dealer choice on the fee plan as they were on.",1.7554945,0.026
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,122,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And just to put in perspective, if we were at 205 third quarter 2010, we just reported 154 per million in the first quarter of 2018, $51 difference, $35 per million has to do with the choice of plan that the dealers were on. And we given rule of thumb before for every dealer that moves from the variable plan to the distribution fee plan at today's volume it reduces the fee capture by about $3 per million. So if you're looking at today in about $35 per million that decline was because of the dealer choice of plan. And I'll just mention just briefly on sort of the pre-prices trough, the biggest difference on the pre-prices trough where we were down if we're just for the variable fee plan we were down at something like $128 per million.",2.2985348,0.361
MKTX-2018-Q1-2018-04-25,123,Answer,2018-04-25,1,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The biggest difference there was 30% of our business at that time was floating rate notes. 30%, you look at today, 5% of our business, floating rate note very short duration, the fee capture is appreciably lower, that's a big difference in fee capture, and the years to maturity were 5.5 years, and they were 7.5 years. So its different environment and again lots of moving pieces here, but today is difference than eight years ago, we reported 205 and its difference than 12 years ago when we reported something appreciably lower than where we are today.",1.6222527,-0.527

We did make some changes in effective January 1st and that is the Eurobond stake and Eurobond specifically it is competitive stake, so we did reevaluate outpricing schedules in light of the increase transparency post MiFID II, so that we have a lot more visibility on where fees are in the market, so we did make some adjustments to put us in line with the market. And as we've predicted we don't fees to be obstacle to growing our business and then we don't being obstacle to growing our Eurobond business. There is lots of momentum with European clients. You saw the numbers we posted. It was 1.9 billion a day in average daily volume, your volumes up almost 30%.

It is size-based. We have different fees for European high yields than we do for investment grade, so I do caution, but the first four months here the range been about 110 to 120 per million.",0.6957596,0.0

Kyle, I probably covered this on prior calls, I don't remember right now, but we have emerging market corporates and emerging market sovereigns and that will be the two big break point on fees, so typically for emerging market corporates its $400 per million and again regardless of size, regardless of majority 400 per million and then if you look at emerging market sovereign bonds including most of what we do in local markets is sovereign bond its $150 per million. And I'll tell you we are completely transparent on this. We have posted our fee schedules under the new SEF rules. It is posted on our website.

Record new issuance in the quarter led to record trade volumes in both high-yield and high-grade. Seasonal factors and the anticipation of higher rates drove record U.S. high-grade new issuance up 13% from the same period a year ago. We believe that the record high-grade new issue activity led to the increase in trade volume and the increase in block-trading during the quarter. U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate debt outstanding is now approximately $8.5 trillion.,0.8626374,0.758
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,9,Remarks,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Demand for a new issuance was driven by heavy inflows of high-grade and high-yield bond fund. We believe international investors continue to flock to U.S. credit markets in a global search for yield. Market conditions in the first quarter were far from ideal for normal secondary trading flows. Yet despite the record new issuance and low credit strengthen and interest rate volatility, we were able to grow trading volume 27% and revenues 17% this quarter.",0.9130037,0.883

Open trading volumes reached another record high of $59 billion in the first quarter with average daily volume up 56% from the same period last year. Approximately 145,000 open trading transactions were completed in the first quarter, up 76% from 82,000 in Q1 2016. The number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform continues to increase. The first quarter saw 672 firms providing liquidity, up from 527 in Q1 of last year. This expanding pool of participants help drive a 103% year-over-year increase in open trading price responses.

Our ongoing investment in international expansion is leading to significant gains in clients and market share in Europe and showing promising signs in Asia and Latin America. Our global emerging market bond trading business has become an important engine of revenue and earnings growth. European client volumes were up 55% year-over-year driven by 24% increase in a number of active client firms.

The plan on fee grade have been in plan and unchanged since 2005. Because our plan is tiered based on ticket size and because the fees we earn are depended on bond duration, fee capture will vary from period to period. In addition to our distribution fee plan, we offer dealers the choice of an all variable fee plan. As a result, the dealer mix also influences the fee capture outcome.",0.8711404,0.0

A shift to bonds with lower average years to maturity and larger trade size were responsible for the drop in fee capture. We also had one dealer switch from the all variable plan to the distribution fee plan at the beginning of the quarter. An important factor this quarter was the significant increase in block trade where we not only saw an increase in the percentage of block trading in the broader market, but our share of such volume increased to record levels. This is all additive revenue albeit at a lower fee rate. Our other credit category fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis even though there was a mix shift between products.

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,36,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's a good question, Rich. You know there's - there is lots of items that influence our high-grade fee capture. But it's not only that, that duration element which is years to maturity and yield sensitive, but it is trade side sensitive and dealer mix sensitive and the number of factors that flow in there. I would give you a little bit of a rule of thumb and it is imperfect or exact science, but what we generally is that every one year in maturity - every change of one year in years to maturity that equates to roughly $10 to $20 per million and then every 1 percentage point change in yields would be another similar amount, $10 to $20 per million. Now I give it as rule of thumb, they are not exact, but that would generally frame it out. And one other thing I did mention in the prepared remarks, we have that one dealer move from the all variable plan to the fixed plan, a move like that typically one dealer that $3 or $4 per million. So there is a number of items that factor in, but using those as a benchmark or rule of thumb you can do some pluses and minuses off of where we are today.",2.4024725,0.778

The record Open Trading, we know that that's an important aspect of the story here and the dealers, I guess, making up, I believe is 22%. I guess my question is can you talk more about, which dealers are doing it? Are these the large dealers or is there any like more specifics you can tell us about, so we can understand a little bit about what's happening on the dealer side? I will leave it at that.",,0.74
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,38,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Absolutely. No, it's a mix of dealers across large and regional and smaller dealers, so it's - the participation level is across the board. It's not every dealer, but the vast majority of dealers are now taking advantage of the liquidity pool that we have built through open trading. And, obviously, Rich, as you know, the comment I made earlier is just dealer initiated trades at 22% of our volume. Dealers are also responding to trade opportunities through open trading when they have not seen the order disclosed and they represent roughly a third of the respondents and liquidity providers in Open Trading. So we're really encouraged by what we see in the growing participation in usage from dealers in Open Training both in taking liquidity as well as in providing prices.",0.3186497,0.957

And one last quick question, the tax rate volatility you spoke to Tony, does that have to do with the share price or actually share - maybe the same and shares issued, is that what's going to drive potential volatility in the tax rate quarter to quarter?",,0.681
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,40,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"It's a couple of things, Rich. So it's - it's not only where our share price will be when awards vest or awards are exercised, but it's also the timing of when options, for example, are exercised. So we can predict with the perfect knowledge when a restricted stock award will vest. What we can't predict is the share price; at least we know the exact timing. Options on other side, we know, for example, we have a batch of options due to expire in January of 2018. Every one of those options are in the money, every one of the options will be exercised the exact timing, we just don't know right now. So we size it up and we can tell you based on today's share price, we do expect the tax benefit for the balance of this year to be around $10 million, the exact timing is what we struggle with a little bit. So, I say for lack of anything else right now, honestly, I'd straight line the impact in the effective tax rate over the next three quarters, but it could swing up or down a little bit.",1.065459,0.98

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,45,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Tony, just a follow-up on the rev capture. Is there any way you can disaggregated how much of the decline in the high-grade capture was related to the higher average trade size because I think just a bit of unusual quarter for industry wide volumes with more of the volume being block trades in the past, I'm just trying to get a sense for if block trading falls back to more normalized levels in the second quarter industry wide and for MarketAxess, what could that mean for a fee capture?",,-0.7
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,46,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Right, right. So for the - if you are looking sequential, that fee per million drop was $23 per million, but the biggest and - this is in order of magnitude, the biggest item and it was a little less than half was years to maturity dropping about half of the year and then yields were up a little bit. So a little less than half of that $23 per million was on duration. The second biggest piece was the larger trade size. And order of magnitude, that was responsible for $7 or $8 per million and then you have the third piece which was the smaller one on the dealer mix. So if you're trying to disaggregate and isolate the trade size impact, it's at $7 or $8 per million. And Kyle when you look at - if you think about going forward, it's tough to predict where this is all going to - where it's all going to come out. I could tell you that looking at April, the block trade size is back consistent with where it's been in the past eight to ten quarters. With the first quarter anomaly, it looks higher than where it was in the prior eight or nine quarters, April is back down to where it's been right now.",0.9522437,-0.66

And then just one on - more of a strategy related question, but, I mean, clearly you've been focused on the institutional side and have a full plate there on growing market share in institutional business, but, Rick, I'm just wondering if you could revisit some of your thoughts around whether it could make sense for you to eventually get into the retail side of the business, especially, if there's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful asset in that space?",,0.976

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,49,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay. And then one last one for me, I think in the last call you talked about opportunity that MiFID II presented for your business. I think generally there's been focus on the need for demonstrating best execution and what that can mean for electronic trading in Europe. I guess, my question is MiFID is more on the potential for spill over into the U.S. as some of these large global firms might take best practices globally adhere to these, so just Rick can you give us any color as to what you're seeing on U.S. side and if you think there could be an acceleration of electronic trading because of MiFID more globally?",,0.92
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,50,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I think it's a very good question, Kyle, thank you. And, first, within Europe we have little doubt that the new regulations will cause an increase in electronic trading in European fixed income and I think it's partly related to the best execution requirements that you mentioned, it's also related to the huge burden placed on market participants for trade reporting. Some of the rules that require as many as 90 fields on every trade to be reported are so onerous that it's almost impossible to imagine doing those trades the old fashion way manually.",0.4468864,0.893
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,51,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, I think, it's a combination of best execution in the trade reporting requirements that are likely to cause an increase in electronic trading within Europe. We are seeing more and more global investors that are active in European fixed income that are starting to apply those same standards beyond Europe because they're running global portfolios. And as a result, we see an increase in the demand for best execution analytics across regions and not just in Europe. And I think there were two common themes there is that one is the regulatory focus on best execution arguably led by the changes in Europe with MiFID II, but not exclusive to Europe.",0.4606227,0.825
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,52,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Regulators throughout the U.S. are also more focused on best execution and they have been in the past. So that trend is there and the other is that the asset owners themselves we hear consistently are regularly asking more questions of asset managers about how they think about best execution in their fixed income portfolios. So there is a widening interest and focus on best execution. And as we've mentioned in calls in the past one of the investments that we've made in our analytical capabilities is related to that and that is we're now providing TCA analytics for all trades that are conducted on our platforms to serve that need from our clients.,0.3667582,0.976

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,65,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I do think it reflects the growing comfort that clients have in executing blocks on the platform and what we notice is that that block orders not surprisingly garnered the most attention of any orders on the platform. So the quality and breadth of price responses grows with trade size. And as a result, good experiences we think will lead to repeat activity from those clients that have had great execution results executing blocks on the platform.",1.5398352,0.559
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,66,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it. That's helpful. A question about industry-wide volumes, you know it was a very strong quarter for both U.S. investment grade and U.S. high-yield issuance, but industry-wide high-grade volumes were up, I think, 14% year-over-year, while industry-wide high-yield was basically flat on an ADV basis. What do you think really is driving that divergence, why don't we see more trading in high-yield?",,0.493
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,67,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think it's a couple of things. First of all, the high-yield new issue calendar did not grow to the same extend that high-grade did. So, there was not that direct connection from growth in high-yield issuance that we think drove the high-grade TRACE volume. The other factor that's impacting both but I would argue high-yield more is the lack of volatility. And this was a highly unusual quarter in terms of credit spread volatility and we believe that that caused a reduction in turn over for active portfolio managers in high-yield.",0.8864469,0.393
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,68,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it. That makes sense. Going back to the conversation on best ex requirements in Europe, can you talk about how your best execution and TCA solution is may be differentiated from some of the others that are out there because it is something that we're starting to hear other companies talk about as well?",,0.893
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,69,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. There is room for multiple solutions. We think that we have a logical place in TCA for global credit markets. And it's really two things, Patrick, first is access to quality data. So, you need a comprehensive database of fixed income transactions in order to do a credible job on TCA for clients. And we have three main sources for data to compare execution quality. The first is obviously the TRACE data in the U.S. The second is the comprehensive data that we have in Europe for European fixed income through Trax. And the third is our own trading data. And as a result, we worked really hard to put together a database that is meaningful for our dealer and client - investor clients so that they can compare execution quality of their trades irrespective of whether they're conducted on the platform or through traditional means. And that is why we think we've got a role to play in TCA within the global credit markets. We are not really doing much on the rate side because we do not today believe that we have those same comparative advantages in rates for TCA that we have in credit.",0.3278388,0.957
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,70,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it. And then one more, Tony, going back to the tax rate question, I appreciate that this is all kind of work in progress but as you think to 2018 and beyond, should there be a sustainable tax rate benefit from your new accounting or is that kind of a 2017 item, and then your initial guidance going into 2017 of 32% to 34% that's probably the appropriate starting point for 2018 and beyond.",,0.775
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,71,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Patrick, never take these items lightly but we've been - you know how we performed which is, we've been in a situation we've had a rising share price for a long period of time, and even when you look back the past five years, the EPS benefit had we been under the new rules, the past five years, the EPS benefit would have been between $0.10 and $0.30 in ETS. You look forward, so this is more forward-looking. I could tell you sitting here today, based on where our share price is trading and assuming that every restricted stock we invest and every option is exercised, I could tell you we're sitting on somewhere between $60 million to $70 million of excess tax benefits to be recognized over the next four years. So, yes, they hurt the fees and sizeable fees that we expect to be recognized in 2018, in 2019, in 2020 but again it's all predicated on where the share price is. It's predicated on the timing of when would options for example get exercise but that's a little early to start talking about guidance for next year but I would bake in some elements of tax benefits going forward as well.",1.0275834,0.966

Not sure if you have any idea of what the addressable market is or large firms that are current - meaningful firms that aren't currently active on the platform that could be? Just kind of trying to get a sense of how much more run rate you have to add active trader firms outside of North America?",0.5991365,0.945
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,75,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think the majority of the large global firms I know they're already active on the platform but the asset management industry outside the U.S. is more fragmented and we think that there is still a much larger list of potential clients. And we were encouraged by what we see in terms of the growth rates across our product capabilities from European clients but also really encouraged as we ramped up our sales commitment to the region in Asia at client on boarding that's taking place in the region. So if we are over 500 active firms outside the U.S. now, I would not be at all surprised to see that that number double over the coming years.",0.3269231,0.974

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,77,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It is - on the data side by way of history on that one, we've been growing the data business around 10% a year in data revenues. It does get masked a little bit more recently because of the FX impact. There's a chunk of our revenue that is generated out of the UK so it does get matched a little bit. But we're providing volume reports and pricing reports and reference data all content that resonate with clients. It is part of the growth story. We think we can grow that data revenue going forward.",1.7907509,0.511
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,78,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Just in terms of costing, can data be 25% of our revenue going forward? I think we still have tremendous room to grow market share and tremendous room to grow our commission revenue and volume. So I do believe we're going to grow the data revenue but we are also in early stages on market share penetration. So, yes, it's going to be an important element in part of the growth story going forward but it's - I don't know we get that 25%.",1.8836996,0.918
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,79,Question,2017-04-26,1,2017,Conor Fitzgerald,,"Thanks.

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,80,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think that a couple of factors there. We are developing new data products in conjunction with our clients every quarter. And as our trading activity grows in terms of share but also in terms of the breadth of products that we cover, it does give rise to new data opportunities going forward. And so the short answer is, yes, we do believe that we can increase the set of data products that we provide. I would echo Tony's comments that given the momentum that we have in our trading business, we still expect the main engine of revenue and earnings growth to come from the trading side but our data products are increasingly providing a necessary important service back to our clients.",0.503663,0.944
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,81,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And the other thing that we said many times is that the key part of data is also enhancing our trading platform. So we are constantly thinking about how we can add more value to clients in both pre-trade price discovery and those tools have continued to advance over the last three or four quarters with a real time composite prices now available in addition to trades and track price to help all of our dealer and investor clients with pre-trade price discovery. And that's an conscious effort to make the trading system more valuable and help in the goal to continue to increase trading market share. So some of what we do in data is for standalone growth in our data business and a key part of it is also enhancing the trading experience on the platform.,0.6671245,0.948

[indiscernible] really difficult to transfer about some of the variables but give a sense of your average client who can provider or pays for your data services their propensity to trade in your platform versus those who don't? I know it's probably a tough question to answer just because the larger firms are obviously buying the data and trading more.

I can tell you that there is no doubt in our mind that our data products in our post-trade TCA and the other things that we work on extensively to add value to our clients are a key part of why they come to the trading platform and trade every day. And oftentimes when they recognize the value of that data, then they want that data delivered into their - directly into their own trading systems through APIs. And so often that's where it gives rise to the data revenue opportunities for us.

Can you just give us some sense of how concentrated that trading is today and are you seeing any greater sense of urgency amongst asset managers just kind of changed their work flows?",0.0298071,0.872
MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,91,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, I think the pool of open trading price providers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks with 670 firms or so would tell you that it is not that concentrated. The vast majority of our clients have set up electronic watch list in the system for the bonds that they care about and match their portfolio needs and when they find matched opportunities as many of them are now clearly in practice of being able to lead with the price. So I think that's a really encouraging sign for future growth. And with respect to the sense of urgency, it varies by firm and there's a lot of work involved in changing the trading process with the coordination, with the order management systems, and the coordination that's required between PMs and trading managers. And when you look at the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth, we're making progress every quarter and we're really encouraged by what we see in terms of shifting the dealer and clients behavioral pattern to participate more actively in open trading. And I continue to believe that the market environment will have something to do with the sense of urgency. Right now things are pretty benign.

Our European business is much broader than Eurobonds as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and we have similar activity levels with European clients in EM and U.S. high-grade, and the growth rates were better there this quarter than they were in Eurobonds but I don't think there's anything specific to call out. And when we look inside the Eurobond market, we see many of the same dynamics that we reported on today in U.S. high-grade with a pretty active quarter on a relative basis for Eurobond new issuance and extremely low volatility of credit spreads.",0.470696,0.933

MKTX-2017-Q1-2017-04-26,106,Answer,2017-04-26,1,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So, Rich, if you ask me today expense guidance, I think we're going to come smack dab in the middle of the guidance that we provided originally which was $192 million to $208 million. You're right, if you analyze the first quarter, it will get to the low end but there are a couple of swing factors in there, headcount is part of it. We do expect to add headcount over the balance of this year. We were up eight or 10 people in the first quarter. We expect another 30 or 40 new hires over the balance of the year. So that headcount does play into it. You may have seen that marketing expense for example was lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, it's a bit episodic. But we do expect the marketing expense year-over-year will be up around 10% that's going to influence Q2, Q3 and Q4 as well.

And thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Global trading volume for the quarter was up 5%, led by record emerging markets volumes and continued growth with international plans/plants. Open trading volume also reached record level in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $99.6 million in Q4 was up 5% and pretax income was down slightly year-over-year. EPS of $0.88 was flat to last year. We believe these results on a relative basis were very strong given the extremely benign market conditions and comparative results all throughout the industry through the quarter. Based on our estimate of market volumes during the quarter, US high grade market share rose to a record 17.6%. The competitive landscape continues to be an area of interest for our investors and stock analysts, unfortunately very low consistent volume and revenue data is available from private company competitors. As a result, we believe the Greenwich Associates annual e-trading survey provides a relevant and independent review of market share trends. Their investor survey results released in Q4, confirm that our competitive position continues to get stronger with an estimated 86% electronic market share in US high grade and high yield trading.",0.9935897,0.97

Credit spread also continued their one way path of tightening ending the year historically low levels. On a broader scale, the past six to seven years have been extraordinary times in global bond markets. Central Bank have injected nearly $12 trillion in new liquidity from quantitative easing into bond markets around the world, sending nearly $10 trillion in government bonds to negative yields.

Our strong year-over-year volume gain of approximately $150 billion was driven by record volume in US high grade and emerging markets. High grade volume was up $94 billion during the year, extending our lead in the space. The growth in overall trading activity was driven by share gains with existing clients, as well as the continued growth in new clients. For the full year, total active client firms grew to over 1,300 firms and all of our major products showing increase in active clients. We are especially pleased with the continued momentum in our emerging markets business. In 2017, emerging markets volume was up 37% year-over-year to a record $307 billion.

You would notice that we also recast our revenue reporting to provide a clear picture of our information services and post trade businesses. Information services revenue is up 20%, principally due to new recurring data contracts. The uptick in post trade and services revenue is mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees.

Total variable transaction fees were down 6% year-over-year as the 5% increase in trading volume was offset the impact of our new high yield fee plan and mix shift within certain products. US high grade fee capture was up slightly on a sequential basis and down $13 per million from the fourth quarter of 2016.

MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,30,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Yes. Hi, Rick. Hi, Tony. Good morning. I guess the first question is with the MiFID II, that appeared to be -- or appears to be strong catalyst for electronic trading in the European markets. And just trying to see in January and one of your peers has reported an uptick in trading but again like you said the private company comps and difficult to sort of get a clear look. But what's your experience in Europe in January? Are you getting the benefit of MiFID II in your electronic trading?",,0.906
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,31,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think we are encouraged by the early signs and the growth in January volumes that outlined earlier is led by European clients. And by way of reminder, we have a broad based and diversified business with those clients in EM, US credit and Eurobond. And we believe that the reason that their trading activity up is attributable to MiFID II. And I would also say that we've seen a significant increase in phone trade processing which of course we do not include in our electronic trading volumes. But those numbers are up as well suggesting that European clients do want to get more trades on regulated venues for reporting purposes. And then as Tony mention earlier, it's also having a positive impact on our reg reporting business was tracked. And we continue to be encouraged about the development we see in our data products.",1.9876374,0.954
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,32,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Thank you. That helps. And then I guess one for Tony. You mentioned that the 11% midpoint expense increased year-over-year, it was a little bit higher than usual. And could you get -- expand a little bit more on where the spending and did that -- is the increase partly driven by increased cash flow from tax reform as well or just a little bit color behind that, the increase.",,0.936
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,33,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Sure, Rich. I'd say I think the tax reform piece of it or any benefits from tax reform really influence our plans around investing in and we are going to continue to invest. We are investing to expand the geographic reach expand the addressable market, launch new protocol, launch new products and also address what's happening on the regulatory front and just to give some color while that 11% midpoint slightly higher than the five years CAGR, a couple of items in there and I say for MiFID II and for Brexit there are discrete incremental spending upwards of $5 million that will be in the recurring run rate going forward. But that's incremental spending that will result in 2018. So that's a bit of an uplift. I'd say the second piece, you have to remember that 30% of our expenses right around 30% is denominated in -- and the functional currency is not the US dollar, so we are subject to FX swing, just as FX movement with the dollar weakening, it does add around $2 million or $3 million in year-over-year expenses. And so if you -- this isn't to make an excuse but if you were to carve out those two items, you are looking at an expense increase somewhere around 7% or 8%. But just, again not to make excuse. WE are trying to explain where the components are.",0.719226,0.772
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,34,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,Got it. And just one last quick one. You gave the tax rate guidance for the year that's very helpful. But you said like the first quarter can be more volatile I would assume because of the stock vesting. Any help on first quarter sort of a range for the effective tax rate in the first quarter?,,0.886
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,35,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So, Rich, in those prepared remarks I had said the tax benefit right now and again you have to realize they were -- we are making estimate based on what we expect to vest based on where the share price will be. But what we are seeing right now that the excess tax benefits in 2018 would be somewhere around $2 million and most of that will occur in the first quarter. Actually most of it occurs today to be quite frank about. So most of that additional tax benefit will happen in the first quarter. And just rough numbers that we are guiding to a midpoint of 24%, you might see something like 21% in the first quarter and then 25% in Q3 and Q4. So it's not going to swing that much. So it will look a bit lower in the first quarter.",0.8913133,0.956

On high yield the changes went through in August and we believe it's fair and scalable fee model for all market participants on our system. Quite honestly I think the flatness in high yield share is had a lot more to do with the benign market environment, the lack of volatility than anything else. And you did see that we put up a record high yield market share number in December, as well Tony picks up we are optimistic that we have a unique liquidity pool that serves the needs of our clients. And I think it will be important to watch the trends over the coming months and quarters to make sure that we are benefiting from the changes that we have made.

MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,42,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"It's a good question, Conor. Because we -- there is no secret that we have the fair amount of cash and securities sitting on the balance sheet. And year end it was right around $405 million. And we don't need $405 million to run the business. So when we look at the money we need for regulatory and working capital purposes, we do have excess capital earmarked for -- to support open trading. So we have excess capital in our regulated entity. There is still a fair amount of excess cash on the balance sheet. We could use upward of around $200 million of our cash and securities if the right opportunity came along. We don't have any leverage on today. We just posted the year where EBITDA was north of $250 million. So we have a fair amount of leverage that we could put on the company. So if the right opportunity comes along we have the flexibility and we can act opportunistically that way. And it would be 2x or 3x or 4x EBITDA will be the type of leverage that we put on comfortably.",,0.973

MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,44,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi, good morning. First one I guess just on the Thompson transaction with Blackstone just curious to get your thoughts on the transaction. How it could potentially impact the competitive environment with Tradeweb? And then just more broadly maybe a follow up to kind of Conor's question about maybe you could help us understand your interest in potentially acquiring to other asset classes outside of cash corporate bonds if there are assets for sale? Seems like in the past you've been kind of just of the view that there is such long run rate here that is important to kind of focus your energy on a core bond space?",,0.963
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,45,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. On the first question, the news was new to us, yesterday along with most everyone else we spoken to so all we've done, Kyle, is read the same media reports and press release that you have. It would appear from what we know that Tradeweb will be included in the assets that Blackstone is investing in. And that creates an additional owner of Tradeweb as well as all the other TR financial assets in Blackstone. TR by all appearances will stay involved with the meaningful equity stake. So it's too early to really predict or even speculate on what changes may come. At face value we do not see any significant difference there in the competitive landscape. And on your second question in terms of M&A. Clearly, we've been growing organically in many products beyond corporate bond. And our interests are well beyond corporate. I would say we believe our competitive advantage is in credit and the credit opportunity is very significant and we think we've served our shareholder extremely well to focus on organic growth. We started another year with that as our primary focus. But there are assets within the credit market that could be complimentary either in clients or products or regions to help us expand inorganically and we would be very interested in anything that fits with that long term vision.",1.3960623,0.992

MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,47,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think with the ADD numbers that I outlined earlier, it's safe to assume that we've seen broad based growth across products. And we'll have as we always do a full detail on our January monthly result out in a few days across every product but as I mentioned we are really encouraged by the start to the year.

Just the other credit fees per million I think are a little bit lower than we expected. I mean high grade was a big higher. Tony just on the high yield product specifically, did that come in where you expected? I think you are guiding towards around $350 per million or did it come in a bit below that on high yield side? And just trying to think about how we should run rate that going forward.",,0.73

So what we've seen post August first implementation of the new fees schedule that those high yield fees are right around $350 per million. Now realize that when you look at high yield we have high yield that trade on price, high yield that trade on spread, , we have all been trading so we have different fee plans or structures working across that.

MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,51,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"So, Rick, you mentioned trade spotting and how you guys had some traction with that. Is that something where trade spotting for voice trade, if you do it you kind of brings people into market access ecosystem and that leads to more electronic execution over time or is that in your view kind of the completely discrete type of activity?",,0.0
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,52,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, to be specific Patrick I mentioned foreign trade capture. And so these are trades conducted bilaterally by phone or their communication mechanisms between clients and dealers the trade off system. And then one or both parties won that trade processed on system. And so we believe that this is a post trade activity that's obviously not in electronic trade and the platform. But it's an ancillary service for clients obviously carry very low with any fees. So it's a service but it does help our clients to increase their efficiency and accuracy at trade reporting. Of course, we are attracted to those clients staying on the system for more of their activity throughout the day.",2.6804029,0.948
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,53,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it. Thanks for that clarification. And then as we think about your investment initiatives for 2018 and where you are going to be investing your technology? I think there are a few things you've talked in the past. One is retail pricing functionality, having streaming quotes; another one is maybe having some sort of auction process throughout the day. What's your most updated thinking on where that spending goes in 2018?",,0.504
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,54,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. We got four or five different priorities and I don't think any of them will come as a surprise to you. First, as we mentioned over the last two or three quarters, we are really encouraged by the momentum that we have in global or emerging markets trading. And that is a vast market that requires investments because we have created a comprehensive trading solution and market place for our clients that includes hard currency, sovereign debt trading, EM corporate bond trading and increasingly EM local market trading with about 25 or 26 local markets available for trading. So one of the investments is to continue to expand EM product offering, while at the same time increasing sales resources to attract more EM local market dealers to the platform and more EM clients around the world. And international client diversification is a key priority for us. So a disproportionate of those sales resources will continue to go into Europe and Asia and Latin America to really take advantage of what we see as a very large and growing EM product opportunity. Within our credit businesses, we are also encouraged by what we see in the investor and dealer desire to continue to increase trading efficiency. And one of the ways that we are helping with that is to invest in auto execution which we rolled out in Q4 in Europe and we are in the process of rolling out now in the US. For small trades this allows investors to execute electronically with absolutely no manual labor whatsoever. So another way that we can further increases their efficiency. And as you mentioned in retail, as we look at that space, we are encouraged by the liquidity pool that we have for micro lot trading, and we do believe that they can be extended further into the retail client segment with the combination of some modest investments in technology to fit with retail and client trading activity, as well as sales resources to focus on the retail wealth advisors and brokers. So something those are so many areas but it's a full agenda. And we are pretty excited about the return on investment that we are seeing currently.",1.1153846,0.981
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,55,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it, very helpful, thank you. And then one for you Tony. And you probably are going to groan when I ask this. But now that we have kind of 2018 OpEx guidance just initial thoughts on 2018. And I think specifically for your occupancy line. Do we basically just think of it as the $8 million from your new headquarters stays in and then what you are currently paying for your existing headquarters rolls off?",,0.707
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,56,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"That saying -- how can I groan, Patrick? You are asking about 2019. Its outside, it's clear it's possible on that. So you have to remember its part of this. Today, we lease about 55,000 square feet in three separate locations here in New York and what we are doing with Hudson Yards, we are taking on 83,000 square feet and the rent expense of per square foot cost for Hudson Yards is right around 50% high. So there will be an uplift, there will be an uplift in rent expense. Now trying to be as clear as I can, if you are taking the GAAP numbers for this year and last year occupancy cost wee around $6 million. If I am telling you that the duplicate rent is about $8 million that means this year for 2018 you should probably modeling something close to $14 million for occupancy cost. And when the new space comes online fully and we exit 299 Park 10 floor, 299 Park 12 floor, 560 Lexington, you can expect those occupancy cost to come down around $3 million. So $6 million last year to up to $14 million down to $11 million for 2019. That's about as clear as I can get.",0.108275,0.778
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,57,Operator,2018-01-31,4,2017,Operator,,Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.,,0.361
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,58,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Christopher Shutler,William Blair & Company,"Hey, guys, good morning. Regarding progress on larger trade sizes, can you give us the block percentage in the quarter and maybe just can you quantify in some way the progress you've made on the work up functionality or [Indiscernible] matching. Thanks.",0.2118644,0.818
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,59,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I think that as we look at our share gain last year in high grade most of it came from larger trade sizes both $1 million to $5 million and $5 million and up. So around 70% of our volume in US high grade comes from $1 million and up trade sizes and about 23% of our volume comes from $5 million and up. So increasingly the share gains are coming larger trade. I think I am right in saying that we are running around 9.5% or so what we see in trades block trades for high grade. So there is definitely progress there in terms of clients getting more comfortable especially with liquid bonds, trading larger ticket sizes on the platform. Now I point out two things. One, we are having some success with work up and sometimes that starts with a $2 million trade-in and ends with a series of trades that add up to something more meaningful in the block trading category through open trading. The other example I would give Chris is in emerging markets trading during the course of last year we introduced a request for market protocol for two way responses in EM local markets and we've seen very fast pickup of block trading in EM local markets through that protocol. So we will continue to invest to deliver technology solution that really fit for both investors and dealers to continue to do more large trade sizes on the system.",0.0508242,0.97
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,60,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Christopher Shutler,William Blair & Company,"All right, thanks, Rick. And then just one more, you talked about the -- you are seeing really strong growth in emerging markets. Is more of that growth being driven by existing clients or trading more or is it being driven more by addition of new client. I know it's a combination of both but just trying to figure out what's the more important driver historically and what will be the more important driver over the next couple of years?",0.3623612,0.886
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,61,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I honestly not sure we have the exact number but you are exactly right it has been both. We've taken on a lot of new clients in EM over the last 12 months globally. And I will tell you that there is a disproportionate share of last year of our EM growth that came from international clients in Europe and Asia, which is why we are increasing our resources there. Those new clients have been incredibly important to our EM growth. The existing clients were prior to 2017 were primarily in the US and their volume are up. But if you looked at last year the growth of newly international clients I think would be the distinguishing feature for the year. And we have reasonable estimates on EM market size given the numbers that we can see from trace EM corporate bond reporting but importantly our tracks database in London and as much as we've grown over the last two or three years in EM, we estimate that we are around 9% of the market opportunity currently. So with client adoption really heating up and our investment in both protocols and sales to attract new and onboard new clients, we are really encouraged that this could be a long-term growth opportunity for the company.",1.4239927,0.989
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,62,Operator,2018-01-31,4,2017,Operator,,Thank you. And our next question is a follow up from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.,,0.727
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,63,Question,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Yes, Hey, Rick, just a little tries to learn from your experience in the fixed income market. But you look historically your market share in December a lot of time; most of the times are highest of the year. And it comes down in January. Could you explain a little bit of color behind that? I know we can look at issuance and we can look at the trade size and block but can you give us a little bit deeper inside on why that happens and I guess what we could expect this year? I know you gave the range, some of the range is already but what's really going on? What's the market catalyst for this to happen all the time?",,0.353
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,64,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, first of all thank you for that question because I think December and January results create a really interesting story of what's really going on in the fixed income markets and why it's extremely difficult to measure trends in electronic trading on market access on monthly basis. Because you are absolutely right we set new records in estimated market share in high grade, high yield and EM in the month of December. But obviously it's a month where market volumes are significantly lighter. And the distinguishing feature is there December as you would expect given the holiday environment is typically one of the lightest months for new issue activity and it is also a month where investors have a lot of yearend portfolio rebalancing to conduct and tax trading. So there is more secondary activity leading into yearend around those rebalances. And when new issues are very high which they are in typically in January and they have been again this year. You see the focus go to the underwriters, that new issue bond trade very actively in the first week or two. Market protocol currently is that that new issue trade generally gets done through the underwriters and the block trading percentage of trace goes up. So if you look at the last two months in December you will see that the block trading percentage or trace was at the low end of the range around 40%. If you fast forward to January, you will see it's up around 46% or 47%, that is reflective of the difference in the new issue calendar and all of the activity in trading those new issues in block size with the underwriters for the first week or two. Now if you ask us which we do prefer, clearly, we like January better than we do December even though our share numbers are lower because market activity is much higher which is driving record trading volumes for the company. So what we do know is if you set back and you look at quarters or years, it is clear to see that there is secular trend going on for greater electronics trading and global credit. And I think that we are highly optimistic that that trend will continue but it's impossible to measure those trends month to month. I can promise you that the fact that our January share is lower than December has nothing to do with client behavior changing and how they feel about market access. It has all do to with what's in trace. And that's what make it really, really difficult to measure market share changes month to month and then we all have to step back and look at them in a longer term basis.",1.5581502,0.89

And just other last quick thing on I guess market share but from what I understood you saying earlier to my first question is that the way you had experienced the benefits or one way you experienced the benefits of MiFID II would be through European clients trading EM in the EM market. And so do imply that's what you are seeing in January. Do I have that picture right? Is there any way you can sort of ballpark quantify that because again I think people are excited about the opportunity that's been produced, that seems like occurring in Europe with this regulatory change.",,0.962
MKTX-2017-Q4-2018-01-31,66,Answer,2018-01-31,4,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Yes. So as you know our European business yield, you'll see an active contribution across products. And I think it's a mistake to view euros in isolation because our business is diversified with EM, US credit and euros, and we are seeing that behavior will change in the first month of January. It's hard to know exactly what MiFID II is and what part is because the market environment is a bit better starting the year than it has been in the fourth quarter and during 2017. But when we look in January year-over-year, our European client activity across products is up about 35%. So we are encouraged by the start to the year with European client activity. And the fact that it does look like the regulatory changes are causing a behavioral shift in electronic trading activity.",0.2371795,0.907

Overall revenue was a record $132 million up 30% year-over-year. The 37% increase in trading volume resulted in a 32% uplifting commissions. Information services revenue was up 7% and on a constant currency basis up 11%. Post-trade services revenue was up 9% and on a constant currency basis up 17%. Expenses were up 19%, and operating income was up 42% year-over-year. Operating margin was up 4.3 percentage points and reached 50% in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 19.8% in the third quarter and 20.9% on a year-to-date basis. We expect our effective tax rate for full year 2019 will be near the lower end of our guidance range of 20.5%.

Total variable transaction fees were up 46% year-over year, driven by the 37% increase in trading volume and an increase in the overall fee capture rate. Our U.S. high-grade fee capture can vary quarter-to-quarter due to variety of factors including duration and trade size. U.S. high-grade fee per million was up $11 from the second quarter level, due to the favorable impact on duration from lower yields and longer years to maturity. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $6 on a sequential basis, resulting from a heavier weighting in trading volume attributable to high yield and emerging market bonds.

Can you talk about in terms of contribution for, kind of, 2020, what you think could have the biggest impact, incrementally?",,0.7
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,35,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, we mentioned a number of new initiatives, some obviously feeding our core business, like portfolio trading; some feeding our market data business, like eNAV and data products. I would say, LiquidityEdge is probably the most exciting opportunity given it's the largest market in the fixed income arena and one we really don't offer today. So having the LiquidityEdge acquisition close these coming weeks and then making available our clients a dealer solution sometime in the first half of next year is an exciting addition to our current offering of corporate bonds across our largest clients.",,0.957

MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,40,Question,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Shocker. But it is about our favorite topic, automation. And I guess, one thing I just noticed the algo responses wrote Open Trading, and I guess the other, I guess, was in the automating when you just talked about all automation. The algo responses were down quarter-over-quarter, but the number of trades were up. And I'm just trying to see is this a more efficient, people getting better, what you call, responses to their - the fewer responses but more trades?",,0.879
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,41,Question,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"And then the bigger part that goes along with this, is this portfolio trading? There's a lot of people that think that's that the next big initiative and not to downplay LiquidityEdge, but as far as moving the corporate bond market more electronic, I guess, would you share that view that this portfolio trading could be the thing that really pushes the automation forward? And that's it.",,0.487
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,42,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Okay. So on the - above the algo execution trade volume, I think, really what we are seeing, Rich, is the adoption of our auto - current Auto-Ex solution is largely in the smaller trade size. So many of the large firms that have adopted Auto-Ex tend to target smaller ticket sizes to allow them to just automate that feature. It allows their traders on their desk to focus on larger, more complicated trades. So it's proven to be quite efficient tool for most of the trading desks that are deploying it.",0.855957,0.896
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,43,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","With the algo responses, you're seeing - they're responding to an Auto-Ex smaller trade size. So you tend to see growth in the transaction volume and with less growth in the algos, if that makes sense. But we are seeing - if you think about our launch of Live Markets, that's a market that calls for live algo streams. So it's a - we'll be seeing much more activity in our algo streams as a result of Live Markets as streams start to join the market. So when you think about the automation of the overall market, we're offering multiple features, and we're just starting really that roll up.",0.0263672,0.751

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The autoresponder that we talked about today is a key function to bring more of the investor interest into an automated feature. If you think about it today, we offer - Auto-Ex is allowing them to auto RFQ, requesting liquidity and you typically get algo responses to those Auto-Ex requests. Autoresponder allows them to actually respond to other RFQs that are in the market, using Open Trading the anonymous feature. So we expect to see higher growth rates of transaction volume as well as volume feeding through our entire auto functionality.",0.3183594,0.772
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,45,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Rich, I'll just jump in on the second one, but I agree with your thesis that portfolio trading has been growing and likely to continue to do so. And I really think it's an important part of the new market-making model that's showing early signs of increasing overall market turnover in credit trading. And it's sort of a four-part answer, but investors in certain situations are finding a more efficient means of transferring risk through portfolio trades with the dealer community. It is still a relatively small part of TRACE. We estimate 2% to 4% of TRACE volume but growing rapidly, and we want to be sure to have the solution in place for our clients, which we will roll out this quarter.",,0.97
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,46,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's also important to remember that these portfolio trades create a lot of secondary activity around the tail risk that investors or dealers are trying to manage, and a lot of that we see. So the growth in portfolio trading is already been part of the growth that you're seeing in our volumes. But I think the other pieces that are improving turnover are the increase in all-to-all trading primarily through our Open Trading solution, which is bringing new participants into the market. And then also the adoption of the ETF share trading in a much bigger way by both dealers and investors is another way to move risk. So you really see this whole new risk-transfer model emerging that we are excited about because we think it will not only be healthy for our volumes but it also comes with the prospect of increasing market turnover.",,0.856

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Rich, I would just add on our portfolio trading solution that we're launching next month. We'll be able to offer clients the ability to trade up to 1,500 bonds, which is unique. We also will allow them to market that to - up to five dealers. So it allows investors that are currently conducting portfolio trades in a less-than-efficient environment, some even e-mailing spreadsheets to conduct it in a much more efficient way and improve the pricing. We'll also be putting in front of our clients, our CP+ calculation.

So I remember weak volatility used to be a little bit of a headwind for you guys, but it's clearly picked up over the past year. So one question we keep hearing from clients is about the impact in the next year volatility settled down a little bit. Now I know this would really ignore like your new product capabilities and launches, like portfolio trading, net spotting, et cetera, but at a conceptual level is there a way to kind of untangle the year-over-year growth in volumes and market shares between some of the market-based tailwinds like widening spreads and revolve versus your organic initiatives, like the rise of algos and the increased use of Open Trading over the past year?",0.1488575,0.973
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,50,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I'll take the first bracket at that one, but this year, we - if you look back at the fourth quarter of last year, we had significant widening of spreads and higher volatility and we did exceptionally well on market share gains during that quarter. If you look at the totality so far in 2019, the trend has been for credit spreads to narrow. That is usually not the ideal market environment for our share gains, but we've managed to gain a significant amount of share across products in spite of that market environment.",0.16163,0.967
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,51,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I do think you're right to point out that one of the risk is low volatility going into 2020, very difficult to predict and there are plenty of geopolitical and sector risks emerging that could change the volatility outlook in a hurry. But very low levels of interest rates and credit spreads for a prolonged period would be a risk to overall market volumes and market share. But we've been through so many different market environments over the years, and I think the consistent theme has been year-on-year market share gains that drive our revenue and earnings growth.

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Rick, I would just add that we are adding to our portfolio the U.S. treasury market, which is certainly one of the largest fixed income markets on the planet and one that we don't offer our clients today. So in terms of organic growth opportunities if you hold market volumes constant, we're tapping into quite a large market with really a large competitor in Bloomberg and their dealer-to-client solution in the rates market followed by another competitor in the client-to-dealer - the dealer-to-client market.

So Kyle, you'll recall that, just generally speaking, when we set up these schedules, we're looking at bid-offer spread in most cases. And we expect the trading in Live Markets, it'll be the more liquid end of trading. It's larger trade sizes, typically with tighter bid-ask spread. Also remember, this is a - it's a liquidity take-or-pay or a markup model. This is - that's the model we think scales best.

I think if you look at high yield and EM in euros, there's a slightly different story in each one, but with high yield and EM, we think it's further adoption of electronic trading by investors and dealers, moving more business away from phone-based trading to electronic trading, which is great to see because those markets are still in early stages of electronification and they are kind of in low teens areas and plenty of growth runway still in front of us.",0.0746337,0.85

There is certainly part of the story is further adoption of electronic trading, but I think, the combination of our Open Trading liquidity and the trading automation tools has really increased our market position in the European region. And remember, European clients are active with us in multiple products. So euros are only a piece of the story.

Is the lower fee capture that you had mentioned kind of a function more of kind of the types of securities that would more likely to trade on Live Markets?

Again, think about how we set up our fee schedules. The bonds typically that tighter bid-ask spread, we charge less. And the community that we're going after here, it's new issue activity, it's the first several weeks after new issues come out. They typically have a tight bid-ask spread.

So it's not a case where we're cannibalizing existing trading activity and market share for transitioning the Live Markets. These are newly issued bonds and benchmark bonds that trade in tight bid-offer and often trade in blocked trade sizes. So even though the fee capture is likely to be lower than what we observe in the rest of our RFQ protocol, it is added to revenue and it's designed to attack a part of the market where historically our share has been low, and we will commit to do what we always do. If Live Markets becomes a meaningful part of our volume, we will be transparent about the fee capture and the volume in that area, just like we are elsewhere.",0.4157509,0.106

Any distribution fees changes that we should be thinking about as we roll into 4Q or early 2020?

So on the distribution fees - and we're always little bit cautious about giving guidance on distribution fees because we give dealers the choice of plans, and in most products we have couple of different choices and some of them have distribution fees, some of them are all variable. If it's all variable there are minimum fee commitments. So it's a little bit difficult to predict.",0.2923014,0.762

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Looking out right now, we are not tracking anything of real substance in terms of movement looking up, but I caution on one thing, the bid swing is around unused minimum fees on plans where dealers have minimum monthly fee commitments. We report those unused minimum fees within distribution fees. It does vary period-to-period depending on activity. So I do caution again, we are not tracking anything of significance, going into Q4, but I do caution those unused minimum fees can move period-to-period.",0.399753,0.527

I mentioned that the transaction cost for the full year are expected to be around $1.5 million, and that's included in our expense guidance range. So we're pointing you to the high end of the 2019 expense guidance range of $256 million inclusive of that $1.5 million. The majority of it came through in the first quarter.

Really, the way a client would use the autoresponder, it's typically going to be a client that's already using our Auto-Ex functionality because they'll understand the parameter settings and have more comfort with the autoresponder as well. It will be likely sold in combination with both. But a client will load a list of bonds that they have some price levels that they are interested in and they can actually allow the autoresponder to monitor for other RFQs that are going on in the market without having a watchlist today and manually responding, which they can do today.",0.237793,0.912

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Most of the clients feedback on autoresponder already was, I'd like to watch this list of bonds, but I just don't have time to then engage in an RFQ process. So this allows them to have certain pricing limits. Certainly, we will be using our CP+ data feed as a guide as well, but it allows them to have certain pricing limits or other criteria around liquidity in the bond, how they RFQ is being formed, and so they can simply respond to RFQs in a fully automated manner and hear back. They can either have an accept button, where they actually make sure that they are priced right for that RFQ.

MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,85,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I would point out a couple of things, Patrick. We have been independent now. We're about to celebrate our 15th anniversary as a public company. And it does, in our opinion, a number of positive things for our clients. One, we're able to take into consideration the priorities for both investor and dealer clients, so we can be very balanced about our decision-making and our strategy with both investors and dealers in mind. I would also point out that our Board of Directors is a tremendous asset for the company, and adding people like Nancy Altobello and Richie Prager and now Justin Gmelich to our Board just this year brings us a really important outside strategic advice to the firm.",0.1863553,0.941
MKTX-2019-Q3-2019-10-23,86,Answer,2019-10-23,3,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we're really pleased with the way the Board interacts with the management team and collaborates on company strategy. On the dealer side, obviously, some of our competitors who have dealer ownership, one of them is going through a transition right now. We would expect that decline in dealer ownership to continue. And ultimately, it's likely now based on what we're reading that LSE will be the majority shareholder longer term. What we think that does is just kind of level the playing field on the dealer side where dealers are agnostic in terms of which platform is delivering the most value, the high-quality client order flow and the right pricing. So we think that, that helps to level the playing field a bit as well.",0.1259158,0.909

When firms - new firms adopt auto execution, do they tend to increase the usage over time? Or is the big hurdle just kind of getting it turned on and then you see a lot of volume come through the pipes? I ask because I'm wondering if we're going to see a similar adoption volume cadence with autoresponder or since clients are more used to automated trading could be more robust and lead to a stronger read-through to trading velocity and volumes?",0.5695565,0.833

Typically, clients would adopt a small set of the Auto-Ex feature, try it out on certain bonds, get comfortable with the pricing and the execution quality, look at the transaction cost savings, do a lot of analytics around it before really rolling out to further bonds or bonds of different types of liquidity. Most importantly, we do see some clients increasing the size of their Auto-Ex. So they would typically launch an Auto-Ex feature on $1 million or smaller tickets and then over time increase those ticket sizes upwards of $2 million to $3 million, and we're seeing some clients adopting a $4 million and larger size limit on their Auto-Ex features. We'd expect to see the similar rollout on autoresponder.

That step function, that was around - right around $10 million in expense in 2019. You tack on the $1.5 million for the LiquidityEdge deal-related costs, you're close to $12 million. And you look at our historical expense CAGR, even including the $256 million this year, the five-year CAGR has been around 12%. And if you just humor me and you say, you take out the senior higher impact and the impact of the deal cost, you're down at something like a 9% or 10% increase year-over-year in 2019. So we were actually little bit lower than our five-year CAGR on an adjusted basis.

MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,46,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It does provide further insight on the competitive landscape in institutional credit and their way of presenting financial information differs from ours. But I do think there are ways to get to pretty good estimates that provide some apples-to-apples comparisons. And the first one that I would look at Jeremy really starts with the revenue section on credit, which last year for Tradeweb was right around $140 million. But it does include all three client segments, the retail business, the interdealer voice brokerage business as well as the institutional electronic trading business.",0.5343407,0.92
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,47,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And if you think about parsing those three, the information we have has the retail business at about $78 million or a little over half of that $140 million. It's hard to know exactly where interdealer voice brokerage is, but we estimate $10 million to $15 million per year is probably a good guess. So that combination gets you to $90 million and what is left that is about $50 million in annual revenue for global institutional electronic trading. We would attribute about half of that to corporate bonds or $25 million a year and the other half to CDS and SDP business. And apologies that we don't have the estimates right, but I think that's one way of thinking about it.",0.3685897,0.565
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,48,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And what it reflects is what we've known all along that Tradeweb has a very strong business and institutional rates through the acquisition of BondDesk now an important business in retail. But the true institutional electronic credit trading business is further down the line and we believe represents something around 3% of total company revenue.,1.0631868,0.869
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,49,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, that would also demonstrate that the area of overlap is just not that great.

MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,50,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The other place I would look is really the volume reports that we and Tradeweb both put out every month. And the three credit products where we compete with Tradeweb for institutional electronic business or U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield and Eurobond credit. And if you look at those three for the first quarter and the numbers that Tradeweb has already put out, the fully electronic high-grade business was $478 million ADV or up about $120 million year-over-year.",0.3232601,0.637
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,51,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The U.S. high-yield number was roughly flat at about $53 million, but euro credit went the other way. I do believe that their reporting mechanics are different for European credit than they are in the U.S. because we have not been able to find a split between electronic business and STP for euro credit. But the full number was down $280 million year-over-year about 18%. And we just took an estimate that 40% of that electronic is electronic and about 60% STP. But if you put those three together what it would suggest is that the volume in those three credit products for institutional electronic trading was flat year-over-year. And as you know from our numbers year-over-year and just those three products our ADV was up $800 million year-over-year. So this is what led to the comment that we are more confident than ever of our competitive position in fully electronic trading and in the institutional credit markets.",,0.976
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,52,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And Jeremy just one other thing that might provide some clues on the space that I would guide you to is that the retail platforms as well as the interdealer electronic venues and some of the institutional cross matching systems are all registered and report to TRACE as ATS. And if you look at ATS volume much of it in the retail space you will see that year-over-year their work growth rates which I think is another sign of the demand for U.S. credit in all client segments. But TRACE as you probably know also carries a flag on whether the volume is D-to-D or client to dealer trading.,0.0265568,0.7
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,53,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And what's interesting about the aggregate ATS volumes that were reported to TRACE in Q1, is one it represents 4.4% market share of all of TRACE and within that 96% of that volume was reported as D-to-D and only 4% is client business. So when you think about the other source of competition that has been talked about coming from platforms like Tradeweb retail or TMC or BondPoint or the interdealer venues. The lesson there is that today is still almost entirely D-to-D business. And there's very little evidence of institutional clients operating within those ATS venues.",0.0815018,0.751

Thanks so much for the detailed color there. just quick follow-up I guess on the auto execution, auto response side of the business here. I know you guys mentioned that the number of firms increased both for brokers and the buy side.

So, this is an exciting area because really what we hear mostly from our clients both dealer and the buy side is, how to reduce the friction around their trading day and much of that is delivered through auto execution services, so you can you can certainly have an RFQ market, but how you interact on that RFQ market can be automated to a point where we have clients that are even having a no touch experience on some of their auto execution.",0.9609375,0.0
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,57,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So I see it as just dramatic upside in our market for not only the growth of our clients remember it's around 46 clients today are using our Auto-Ex features that's out close to 1500 clients globally. So we have a long road ahead of auto execution growth. But, what it does, it reduces their daily job of executing orders across a very diverse market of products. So and it's one thing where you hear about expense reductions on the buy side, they are reducing -- looking to reduce how much, how many people they put on their desk to solve the broad number of products that they have to trade. So I would say the demand is high and getting higher. And it's not just from the buy side, it's also from our dealer clients looking to increase their ability to have algos on the platform.",,0.21

And Rick, you mentioned that you feel like we're at an inflection point and I guess what jumped out at me was the number of trades. I was just trying to see how the number of trades, it's up 11x or 12x year-over-year. What was it last quarter?

Auto-Ex in the fourth quarter that the trade count was around 60,000, so Q1 does represent another big increase sequentially. And these are early days, so these numbers we think can go significantly higher because the asset managers are very, very focused on trading efficiency right now and to the extent that they can fully automate the low impact smaller ticket, it makes a big difference to trading efficiency.",0.7142857,0.957
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,61,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I would point out that what is enabling this to happen is the quality of our real-time data. So you see composite price plus in particular as a primary driver in how investors think about their willingness to execute on an automated basis relative to where they would have expected the responses to come back. So I'd say, it's a combination of the investment we've made in data plus the technology to help them.

And anyway, the follow-up question would be -- the market share -- you comment on market share in April to-date I guess and be down in 1Q that would be -- it seems a little surprising given the march trends as well as what we see in April. And did you talk about -- did you mention duration and the pricing, I didn't hear -- I'm not sure whether I caught all that on April?",,0.87
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,64,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So, Rich, it's Tony. On April, the one prepared remark we said was that market conditions look similar to the first quarter. And what that means in a more granular level, if you look at the nature of the flow on the platform, it is continues to favor the offer wanted side. You know that the hit rates are lower on the offer wanted side versus the bid wanted side. So that trend continues. We continue to see narrowing spreads, which again a more favorable environment for us would be spread gapping out or more volatility and new issuance has been fairly healthy in April.",0.2774804,0.934

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The other pieces coming through in April which is a continuation of Q1 is that a block percent of U.S. high-grade is up at about 46%. So that would be close the high watermark. So, for us market conditions continue to be not as constructive as what you saw say in the first quarter of '18 or the fourth quarter of '18.

MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,67,Question,2019-04-24,1,2019,Dan Fannon,Jefferies,Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on Slide 6 on the international progress and kind of talk about some of the higher level trends. I was wondering if MiFID or any regulatory changes also part of the kind of pickup that you saw here in first quarter and really over the last several quarters.,,0.914
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,68,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I wouldn't really say that that MiFID this time around is driving any trading behavior changes with clients. That was an impact Q1 or Q2 last year, would MiFID II first went into place. The things that I would point to is clearly European investors and dealers are now benefiting from the expansion of open trading in Eurobonds and emerging markets. So that differentiator in terms of our liquidity pool and driving down transaction costs is clearly one of the main factors that is allowing us to take share from key competitors in Europe.",0.470696,0.765
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,69,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Secondly, we made big investments in protocols. We've done some new things around open trading protocols specific to European clients as well as in EM. And then, I would reiterate that the third piece that has surprised some market participants is that the quality and breadth of our real-time data for European clients is far greater than what's available through the APAs from MiFID II currently. And that's because the vast majority of corporate bonds are not deemed liquid by the regulators currently, so they don't qualify for real-time reporting. So our investment in CP+ and Axess all to provide real-time data tools we think is also part of what's driving clients to use MarketAxess more each quarter.",0.2293956,0.671

MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,71,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes, Dan. So, you're right. If you took the first quarter and you simply multiplied by four you're going to get to the low-end of the guidance range. But when we think about this year and we've talked about this on the January call, the investments that we're making to expand our addressable market, expand the geographic reach, support new products and protocols, all of that is embedded in the expense guidance. And at this point when you fast forward for the rest of the year there's -- you'd typically talk about three variables and the one big variable would be about around headcount. And right now headcount -- the headcount hiring are on track with our plans. We do have expectations that we're going to grow headcount throughout the balance of the year. So we're -- we feel good about the headcount numbers that.",,0.9
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,72,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The other variable typically is around variable compensation and we had a very good first quarter and April right now what we said was April volumes are tracking up 20% over April of last year. We expect to continue to deliver. So the view on the variable compensation is consistent with where we had planned. The other factor in there will be around foreign exchange, we do have 50 million sterling of expenses. So that that FX movement could influence expenses up or down, right now, FX rate is tracking close to budget. So I know looking at the consensus estimate, I think everybody as a group or probably more toward the lower half of the range than in the middle or upper half of the range.

It's been -- the demand has been quite high for some time. We've been looking at a variety of different solutions including building our own solution. But given the economics and ETF share trading and the economics in building new solutions for credit trading obviously partnering with someone made a lot of sense.

And then, just a follow up, I just wanted -- on the Eurobond, I know, we spoke a lot about it already, but just the open trading there continues said to take hold. I think just two years ago is the low single digit range in terms of open trading penetration in that Eurobond business and move substantially higher. And I think even grown sequentially from 4Q to 1Q as well. Just wondering if you could provide some commentary around the competitive dynamics not just between you and Tradeweb what you've given already, but between you and Bloomberg, is the larger player there on the Eurobond side. Just wondering how sustainable you believe the competitive maybe market share shift is here in terms of staying ahead of Bloomberg and in terms of protocol technology and open trading liquidity pool and suggesting that they can do from a competitive standpoint to kind of slow the market share shift.",,0.705
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,79,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Happy to take that one. We're very happy we got out in front on all to all trading or open trading five or six years ago and it's is a major investment as you know Kyle and it involves lots of work in technology, lots of work in risk management and the infrastructure, lots of client documentation. And so, we do believe that we've got a significant lead in the all dollar open trading space for institutional credit. I'm sure that our competitors are well aware of the progress that we're making in Europe and the growth there. I am not aware of any plans by Bloomberg to move into all to all which of course would require that they really establish a full fledged broker dealer and make all the investments in infrastructure to go there, which we have not seen yet. I would expect that with the new ownership structure Tradeweb will have more flexibility on determining their own path around all to all trading. So, we are expecting that all competitors will continue to invest more. Given the success that we are having and the growing demand from both dealers and investors, it's clearly here to stay and you're seeing a total transformation as the market making model in institutional credit where ETF shares are very much in the mix, electronic trading is growing all to all is an important source of liquidity. Portfolio trading is getting more active and we are right at the center of that and we would expect it to continue to grow.",,0.99

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Rick I would just add, in Europe, we're seeing a high demand for the auto execution features. We certainly see many of the dealers providing algos on our platform. So the demand for electronic execution in the Eurobond market is quite high and growing. So I think the overall market that market share which is electronic in Europe is growing to our benefit.

In other fixed income asset classes and one thing in particular treasuries, we've seen -- [indiscernible] providers like liquidity edge really start to make some inroads. Do you think that sort of market solution is a viable solution in the core bond space or because the core bond universe is so fragmented and illiquid, it just really wouldn't work.",,0.896
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,83,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think a little bit of both. When we really think about live market environments, we believe that the most liquid corporate bonds and especially new issues could move in that direction. And we also see automation really having a huge impact on small ticket. So, I think that there are parts of the market that could go that way. The number of bonds that are liquid enough on a regular basis in corporates is a small subset though, you see somewhere around 30 to 50 bonds that have enough turnover during the day where they could actually operate in [indiscernible] central limit order book model. So I don't think it's likely to take hold broadly throughout corporates, but there are segments of the market where automation could lead us in that direction.",,0.359
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,84,Question,2019-04-24,1,2019,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Got it. Thanks. And then, just curious about industry wide corporate bond volumes, most asset classes volumes were down pretty significantly year-over-year on the first quarter in corporate bonds and I think in particular high-grade or kind of outlier with industry-wide volumes up pretty nicely in the first quarter. Any sense of kind of what is driving that and I guess maybe to that point is growing electrification now starting to have an impact on trading velocity do you think?",,0.952
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,85,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Very much thanks for the question because that is our belief and it follows on the comments I just made about the market making model changing. And look there's no doubt that corporate bond demand was running extremely high in Q1 not just in the U.S. but internationally. It was all triggered by the rapid shift in central bank policy and the messaging from the Fed and elsewhere about concerns about the economy and slowing down the move toward higher rates. And what that triggered, for one example Patrick is the amount of government debt around the world trading in negative yields spiked from around $8 trillion back up to almost $11 trillion. And that triggers a lot of demand for U.S. credit. So that's clearly one of the drivers.",,-0.493
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,86,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But, what I really like about what we see is that the amount of corporate bond debt outstanding in the U.S. year-over-year was up about 6%, but TRACE volume was up 14%. And I think that's exactly to your point that we're now moving to a new model with investors and dealers embracing new ways of transferring risk including electronic trading and all dollar trading that is starting to have a positive impact on overall market turnover. And that could be a very positive thing for our business because those turnover rates have generally been trending lower since the financial crisis. And I do believe now with new entrants in the market combined with greater levels of automation we may be at the beginning stages of now starting to see those turnover numbers head back higher.",,0.476

MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,112,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So two things there. And you're right to pick on you know pick on the two items which is more market share and capture rates. If we got to an environment where you know where yields are rising here, or we have a flattening of the yield curve. We've seen with the flattening of the yield curve, we have seen the year to maturity come in. So that means duration for us is a little bit lower. But, when you look over the past five quarters now that's one factor the past five quarters are U.S. high-grade fee per million has not moved. So there are other factors that influence it. If the yield curve you know continues to flatten you could see some further decline in years to maturity.",0.5907781,0.503
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,113,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"On the flip side, on the market share piece of it, we do better across all trades sizes. We do better when -- with shorter dated paper and if with a rising yield environment or a flattening of the yield curve, clients are tending to trade shorter dated paper. Our market share is typically higher. So, all things being equal if yields go up across the curve, you probably see some dampening in our in our fee per million again lots of things go into that equation. But you probably see market share go up as well.",0.4965006,0.91

I'm just kind of curious the growth in international clients, the busy share gains you're seeing, the volumes you're seeing, they've been driven by new clients coming on or increased business from existing clients. And what do you guys think your penetration wise in terms of the international client base.",,0.936
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,117,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"I'm not sure we have the specific numbers on contribution, but it's obviously a little bit of both. We're really pleased with on-boarding more clients not just in Europe, but in Latin America and Asia as well that are helping us to drive the international numbers to new highs. But as you would expect Chris, the lion's share of the secondary volume still comes from the largest asset managers and we are definitely turning some of those in our favor that have been active on other platforms in the past and continue to do more on the MarketAxess system and are clearly benefiting from the broader liquidity model that we have.",0.8801976,0.983
MKTX-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,118,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",Yes. And Chris I would add that some of that growth is being driven by the diversity of liquidity that is on the platform. The EM local markets you need local dealers and we've been adding those local dealers to our platform across the international market. That's key to some of the liquidity that's being accessed by the some of the global institutional investors on the platform. So it is important that you just can't have a valuable network with the largest dealers you have to have a diversity of dealers to grow across all these international products.,0.0859375,0.858

And that's really the additive distribution that we expect to see from Refinitiv. And in one of the conversations that I had with them, when we were contemplating this partnership, their distribution network is massive right. There are 200,000 or 300,000 data clients and we are a small fraction of that in terms of the trading community. And they're truly global. And so some things like what we're able to offer an EM broad application around the world in places we just can't reach on our own.

MKTX-2021-Q2-2021-07-21,53,Question,2021-07-21,2,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I guess, Rick, the first question is market conditions dramatically changed from the same quarter last year and - but we have seen a little bit of volatility at least in the overall markets and I think some slight volatility upticks in the credit markets in July. Can you give us any feel for how - whether you're seeing the same sort of movement back in a more environment - more friendly to market access?",0.6840659,0.957
MKTX-2021-Q2-2021-07-21,54,Answer,2021-07-21,2,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. And happy to take that question. This - just the last three or four days, Rich, we've seen some better volatility and it has come through in our volumes and especially in high yield share. It's a little bit weird, which is why we really didn't comment on it because at the midway mark in July, the first half has the 4th of July holiday weekend with very low volumes on the short trading day on July 2nd.

MKTX-2021-Q2-2021-07-21,55,Answer,2021-07-21,2,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But you're absolutely right. If you look at just the last three or four trading days with even some signs of volatility coming back, it has been beneficial for our business. And the place where it's most noticeable is obviously that ETF community gets engaged in our high-yield product, in particular, when there is volatility in high-yield spreads, which we have seen more recently.

And I do think that different protocols work best in different environments.

We focus on the 75% or 80% of the market that's driven by institutional investors. So, as dealers have embraced electronic solutions, some of our competitors that have dealer-to-dealer businesses and voice brokers are benefiting from that transition in the short run slightly more than we are, but we're encouraged that we're participating in it through dealer RFQ into Open Trading.

And you saw the savings that came through this year, largely as a result of our self-clearing transition activities in the U.K. and our settlement agent transition activities - I'm sorry, in the U.S. and then the settlement agent transition in the U.K. But depending on market conditions and market volumes, those clearing costs can swing up or down as well.

And really the non-transaction will be around post-trade and on the information services side. And in the first half of the year on post-trade, you did see a big pickup because of the integration of the Regulatory Reporting Hub business. It's about $8 million in revenue in the first half of the year. It's more than meeting our expectations in terms of revenue contribution. We've also seen a pretty big increase in organic revenue. We have new services in the past 12 months around SFTR reporting and repo matching. There's new client additions as a couple of firms have exited the transaction reporting market.",0.0395224,0.921

And what that would translate to would be 30%-plus growth on the organic side and then overlay the Reg Reporting Hub side. So, the back half of the year is similar. Although, I will tell you something in post-trade it is - our transaction reporting revenue is somewhat tied to volume, so there is - there are tiered volume plans, so volume does matter, but use of first half is a pretty good proxy there.",0.2964183,0.7

It's much easier to conduct basket trades when volatility is low.

And thinking between MarketAxess and other platforms, it looks like the percentage of electronically traded is pushing something in the 40%-ish range, give or take, at least in the last couple of months. So, can you update us on your latest thoughts about sort of the ultimate penetration opportunity for electronic platforms here? 70, 80, 100, kind of how do you guys think about that? What does the growth path looks like to get you there, i.e., like what are the key kind of customer pain points that you think you need to solve to drive that share higher?

But the first disclaimer is that the estimates you see are just that they are estimates provided by venues that have wildly different reporting standards.

We have our recurring dividend in place, where we're targeting paying out about one-third of our earnings and free cash flow. And then we have the share buybacks. And really, we use share buybacks to offset dilution from equity grants. On those share repurchases, they come in two forms. We've got buybacks under Board approved or Board authorized plans. And then we've got net-downs on restricted stock vesting and some of the stock option exercises.

But you're correct, just looking at the buyback plans, repurchases were higher in Q2 than the first quarter. But we're going to continue to maintain that philosophy of using repurchases to offset dilution. That's why the diluted share count hasn't really varied in the last seven years.

Last 16 months has been impacted by the pandemic and in the near-term around the T&E spend. When you look at the second quarter, a little bit of an uplift and it's again - tends to be episodic, but a little bit of an uplift around some advertising campaigns and a little bit of a resumption of T&E.

Those are the - some of the key benefits of clearinghouse efficiencies. And so, as distributed ledger steps into securitized products, there are some limited areas where they do provide efficiencies.

It may actually be interesting in new issue markets, where it's much quicker to bring a securitized product to market.

I just - over the past five or seven years, it just feels like the organic growth rate and expenses has kind of been in this 8% to 10% range on average. I'm just wondering, how should investors think about the medium-term expense growth rate - organic expense growth rate of the business, given the investments that you're making. Is it in the double-digit range? Is it in the 10% to 12% range? Should we be thinking about that over the medium-term?

So I guess, the point here is, what are you trying to say versus your competition. And isn't - I assume that D2D space is much lower capture, but isn't a good liquidity as well?

So the build out in the investment and the cost, both in terms of time and human value to build that client network.

We're - we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity in Global EM and the progress that we are making.

Just here in January, we're seeing our month-to-date volume increasing from both December and obviously, prior year, January 2019. We're close to just over $800 million in volume in the month. So a pretty exciting area, we are seeing a shift from - among the retail dollars moving into SMA accounts, which are putting muni dollars in the hands of large institutions where we have a competitive advantage. So we've seen some uplift from adoption of our traditional, institutional clients as they shift how they handle their muni desks. And we're seeing rewards from both technology investments and also the OMS solutions that we provide those institutions. So we're excited about the muni space.

Well, first on the scaling, I think it's most evident in our automated trading solutions. Our Auto-X feature, as I mentioned, saw a $24 billion in volume just in the fourth quarter alone. So we didn't add headcount to offer additional auto execution functionality. And yet we are seeing those levels of volume coming across the platform. We are also seeing better penetration within clients that have already adopted Auto-X.

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So that's some of the growth is both new clients adopting auto execution solutions but also current clients increasing their use of auto execution. And then as I think about a portfolio trading probably has the most scale because it's built, we're adding features throughout the year 2020, but the largest part of the building has been done and now it's really client adoption. We have 93 clients now onboarded to execute portfolio trades. That's about 830 traders across our institutional client base and now 11 dealers supporting pricing in our portfolio trading solution.

So dealers and clients are still negotiating the bonds in the portfolio and the pricing benchmarks that they will use off system with spreadsheets and then taking advantage of the processing benefits online.

And also - the other thing that we do is track what we believe to be portfolio trades that hit the TRACE tape. And while the growth rate has been very high, the estimates that we have that we've confirmed with major participants in portfolio trading around 3% or 3.5% of high-grade TRACE volume. Taking place through portfolio trading and more like 2% to 2.5% in high-yield. So it's an important and growing segment but still a relatively small part of the secondary market.

While pricing doesn't change, they are continue to be automated RFQs over time how we execute an auto execution and the speed of the RFQ can be increased. So you get the similar benefits to a streaming price as you speed up RFQ into a continuous RFQ or a request for stream type of model. When I look at the rates business obviously that the most liquid asset class on the planet is our U.S. treasury market, it continues to be serviced by an RFQ model from the dealer-to-clients market - in the dealer-to-client market.",0.0449219,0.895

Two questions, in high-grade, it looks like Open Trading as a share of your total volume has been pretty flat over the course of the year. Maybe just talk about what's caused that stabilization in that percentage. And then secondly in portfolio trading, I hear what you're saying that it's early days, but over time is that functionality does become more automated and matures.

But when you look at Open Trading percentages, 27% is still a significant addition in new market liquidity for credit market participants. But it will also vary in our opinion with overall market conditions. And we saw a huge increase in Open Trading percentage in the fourth quarter of last year, when we had a significant pickup in credit spread volatility and widening spreads. That was not the case this year where we had a decline in credit spreads throughout the year and a decline in volatility. So I think you'll see it vary with different market conditions.",0.2330586,0.936
MKTX-2019-Q4-2020-01-29,107,Answer,2020-01-29,4,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,The other point to remember is that our trading automation tools have allowed dealers to be much more responsive on the system to client inquiries.

It's something that we have been striving to get in the middle of - portfolio trading solution, it really requires a great deal of efficiency today, dealers and clients are passing back spreadsheets.",1.0878906,0.657

Over time we think it can generate more secondary trading activity on the platform as a result of either dealers liquidating positions brought down from a portfolio trade. So the pricing of our portfolio trading and again its initial rollout pricing is lower than traditional RFQ but the size of the portfolios can get quite large. And it is a target market that we don't have on the platform today and one that we're chasing.,0.690918,0.245

So Rich, you're right that there's lots of factors that influence the high-grade fee capture. And we're really talking about investment-grade here. And years to maturity matters yields matter. We have a tiered fee plan. So trade size matters. We have the mix of dealers that are participating.

Some of the newer protocols of fee capture is different. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But Rich, you're right. Looking at say Q4 versus Q1, that's probably the best way to describe it. And when you look at those two periods, fee capture was down about $7 per million. A couple of items in there. Trade size was one of them. Not a big influencer, but trade size did tend to shift to a little bit larger trade size as our fee capture is a little bit lower.",0.8678469,0.243
MKTX-2021-Q1-2021-04-22,48,Answer,2021-04-22,1,2021,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Dealer mix. So when we look at dealers that are on all variable plans versus fixed plans, a little bit heavier weighting to dealers on fixed plans, fee capture a little bit lower. But the item you mentioned which is very interesting, as Rick picked it up on in his comments, we're at -- close to the post credit crisis high on years to maturity of bonds traded over the platform. Typically, that would result in higher fee capture dollar value of the basis points higher with longer years to maturity. But in this case, what offset the years to maturity was the fact that yields were up. So again, you're right, you look at fourth quarter to first quarter, you did see a rise in bond yields.

We're seeing more activity on Live Markets and it's quite encouraging, because it is a brand new protocol to the credit space. And what we have seen is we've got 19 dealers live on the platform. We expect to have new announcements around designated market makers on the platform as well. We would likely have up to three designated market makers.

Well, I continue to be excited about the muni market and our opportunity there. You're talking about a very large market, a difficult market to trade because of the breadth of product in that market.

I do think as you think about that market there's sizable costs to large investors to maintain their large -- small trade size across the muni market.

And think about where we are today. We're at about 2% market share. And we've talked about this before in terms of revenue opportunity. For us every 1% of share equates to about $10 million in annual revenue. We don't know where this will end up in terms of electronic adoption, but you can do a little math around it.

But listen, it's an important part of the market. We're investing in new solutions to address blocks, and we're seeing good progress in some areas as well. And I would point to high-yield in particular, where for many years, almost all of our volume was in odd lot trade sizes. And if you see the big jump year-over-year in high-yield share, the majority of that is driven by more success in what is considered to be block size trades in high-yield over $1 million.",0.0320513,0.661

I apologize, I joined a few minutes late. But just on -- back to the high-grade market share question, given the growth initiatives, and a pretty good client traction that you have across the different protocols, including Auto-X, and the transaction savings given that versus the challenges of the lower volatility as a sort of a more of a macro headwind. When do you -- maybe --start to answer but when do you think you could cross those initiatives and client traction could outweigh that headwind of volatility as we sort of move through 2021 in terms of having a year-over-year gain in high-grade market share?

Overall trading volume was up 25% as we experienced healthy volume growth across each of our core four trading products.

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Our other credit category trading volumes were up 40% year-over-year in large part due to gains in estimated market share. Our trading volume gains in emerging markets, U.S. High Yield and European corporate bonds far outpaced the year-over-year rise in estimated market volumes. The results were particularly satisfying for these products, given an inquiry mix during the second quarter that favored client buying.

Total variable transaction fees were up 27% year-over-year, largely driven by the 25% increase in trading volume. U.S. high-grade fee per million was up $9 from the first quarter level as the favorable impact from lower yields and slightly longer years to maturity was somewhat offset by a mix shift in trade size buckets.",2.6636476,0.494

The contribution to other credit volumes from emerging markets, high yield and European credit was little changed during the quarter. Our shift in dealer mix accounted for a small decline in emerging markets and high-yield fee capture. We had one dealer migrate from the U.S. high-grade distribution fee plan to the all-variable fee plan during the second quarter, which resulted in a sequential decline in U.S. high-grade distribution fees.",2.6694113,0.778

He's been at the forefront of the convergent to electronics and fixed income. So great addition to your board. I think the first question is on self clearing. Can you approximate the savings that -- maybe I missed it. But can you approximate the savings and when it will be implemented?",,0.893
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,51,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So Rich, it's Tony. So on the sub-clearing and the clearing initiative, today we use a third-party clearing broker to settle and match principal trades. And when we look at clearing cost as a percentage of open trading revenue that's one of the principal metrics we use, it's been bubbling around 11% or 12% or 13% of open trading revenue.",1.6286538,0.598
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,52,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So we're going to move to the self clearing model in the U.S. You also heard that we are changing out settlement agents outside of the U.S. And the cost structure, it will scale better. But even what's important is that it's going to improve customer service and better support our emerging markets initiatives. So we're -- there are multiple benefits here.",2.3318238,0.93
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,53,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"When we look at clearing cost as a percentage of revenue, you use that metric we believe that we can drive clearing costs in that particular metric into the single digits. So again if it's 11% or 12% or 13%, we think we can get it into the single digits. Exact date it's some time in the first half of the year. It's hard to pin down on an exact date but expect those savings to flow through over the course of 2020.",2.881021,-0.052
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,54,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Rich, it's Chris. I'll just add. It's important to point out that we have a well-capitalized broker-dealer because of the commercial needs when we're a counterparty to some of the major institutions around the globe. And so that capital is now being deployed as clearing fund deposit for our activity. So we don't see an immediate need to further capitalize the broker-dealer because it is overcapitalized for commercial reasons.",1.4980469,0.66
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,55,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And so we're leveraging capital that's sitting on our broker-dealer balance sheet and reducing our variable costs of trading. So it's a great project and one that delivers not only savings but allows us to expand. There is an important point, the change of the global agent that allows us to expand our local markets in EM, which as you can see our EM continues to grow rapidly.",1.2246094,0.869
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,56,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Got it. Got it that you're in a unique position there. I guess my follow-up would be this past quarter was -- for those of -- it was unique as far as interest rate movements, the yield curve and then -- I guess the question is on macro, what if we -- is there things to takeaways from what happened in the quarter in regards to the performance either way people trade bond electronically in this type of environment?",,0.459
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,57,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,And the other macro thing I think that's lingering is the potential for hard Brexit now. Could you comment on some of these factors that are out -- that aren't fundamental but certainly would impact you Rick?,,0.44
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,58,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I'm happy to. Thanks Rich. The macro environment I commented in the prepared remarks, if you look at a quarter like Q4 when spreads were widening significantly that's typically where we deliver the biggest market share gains. So what we are encouraged by when you look at the first half of this year is it's been a consistent spread tightening environment and spreads have basically recovered almost entirely the move from the fourth quarter.",2.4400183,0.968
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,59,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So for us to be gaining share and gaining volume the way that we are and what is really an offer wanted environment where there is a search for yield going on globally, it gives us great confidence that we are in the midst of a secular change in client behavior toward more trading automation and electronic trading. Because we look into the second half it's really hard to predict, of course, but we now are at lower levels of spreads and lower levels of yields as you have mentioned. And we would expect as it's normally the case seasonally for new issue volume to be lower in the second half than it was in the first half.",2.6451465,-0.165
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,60,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With respect to Brexit, we've been preparing for several years and we feel very good that we are ready for any outcome. Clearly, the view is that the odds of a hard Brexit have increased this week, but we are ready to go. We have all of our regulated entities now set up in the Netherlands and we have clients in the EU trading through our MTF in Amsterdam every day. So we are ready to switch over. The liquidity experience is very similar in our Amsterdam MTF as it is in the U.K. And we feel very good about our preparation for Brexit.",2.7651099,0.951
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,61,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,Got it. Thank you. It was very helpful.,,0.68
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,62,Operator,2019-07-24,2,2019,Operator,,Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.,,0.361
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,63,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Dan Fannon,Jefferies,"Thanks. A couple of questions on the new business initiatives. The Live Markets description seems like it would compete a bit more with the banks directly. Just in terms of going after new issue, can you talk about that offering in more detail please?",,0.66
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,64,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. Live Markets is not designed to compete with the banks. It's actually designed to help the banks provide what they have built on their side which is streaming liquidity, streaming dealer liquidity. We're seeing it today in response to RFQs. So it facilitates both banks and non-banks ability to stream to clients across the most liquid end of the bond market. What's unique about Live Markets, not only does it help facilitate a liquidity being driven from the banks, but it also allows investors to rest orders really for the first time in the bond market. If you think about the overall global market in fixed income, it's driven by a Request-For-Quote, where clients are asking the community for a price.",,0.612
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,65,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Now our investors with the introduction of Live Markets, clients will be able to place orders in a market that is available to all and that's a critical function that has been missing from the bond market. It's a function that we take for granted in other markets both the future's market where clients can rest orders and obviously the equity market globally where clients can rest orders. We are building a place for clients to rest orders side-by-side with dealers to stream price to clients.",0.3979492,-0.361
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,66,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Dan Fannon,Jefferies,"Great. A follow-up for Tony, just on expenses. Thinking when you get the high-end for this year, but thinking about next year, where you have the self-clearing coming in, I think you said the rollback of roughly the $10 million retention and obviously the ongoing investment in the core business. And so just directionally or kind of from a growth perspective, how we should think about 2020 from an expense perspective would be helpful?",,0.714
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,67,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Wow, Dan. It's early to start talking about 2020, at least for some specificity. But I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have the senior higher activity and that retention activity, it's not likely to repeat in 2020 that was around $10 million. And while we're not prepared to give an exact range right now, just a couple of items to think about -- and the first one, we're going to continue to invest. So we're continuing to invest in people and infrastructure to support growth and we believe that's what our shareholders are looking for. We're not playing this for the short term and we want to make sure that we are capitalizing on the opportunity in front of us. So we're going to continue to invest the senior higher activity. While it's in the base, we don't intend on hiring another President although sometimes I do wonder about that, but we're not hiring another President.",2.508028,0.81
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,68,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,If you hope so.,,0.44
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,69,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And also you will see while it will not be in Q1 you will see the benefit come through for this clearing initiative and changing clearing arrangements. So you will see that coming through definitely in the back half of the year. I -- it's tough to give you the range right now, but I think all of us would be a little bit surprised if you saw an expense increase like you're seeing this year, up 15% year-over-year again with some of those items that I'm pointing out here. You're not likely to see that repeat again in 2020.",2.7546315,0.867
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,70,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Dan, it's important to point out on the self-clearing initiative, it is a lengthy approval process, so it requires your investment at the front end of the process. So people and platforms need to be in position way before launch date. So most of that investment will happen this year and you'll see a run rate in this year that will follow into self clearing in the first half of next year.",2.1304945,0.599
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,71,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Dan Fannon,Jefferies,Great. Thank you.,,0.765

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,73,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi, good morning. If I could just ask couple of follow-ups on the Live Markets initiatives. I know it's focused on new issues and story bonds. Can you help frame the percentage of total secondary market trading that this offering will address? And then, can you share anything in terms of where you think the net capture rates will shake out and any incentives that may need to be in place for the dealers?",,0.885
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,74,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Happy to take that one. Kyle, good morning. But as we've said on previous calls Live Markets is really aimed at the very liquid end of corporate bond trading, which historically interestingly enough is not where we have done our best in market share. And part of that market is clearly newly issued bonds and the other are the large benchmark deals that trade in a very liquid way throughout most trading days. And I -- the other clear focus for us in Live Markets is in increasing block trading market share.",2.1597985,0.967
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,75,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"What we have seen in EM is the investment in the Request-For-Market protocol significantly improved our result in block trades and block trades now make up a significant part of our growth in EM trading especially in local markets. And there is some similarity here with the Live Markets initiative in terms of aiming at the very liquid end of the market and the block trading market. When we try to estimate what percentage of TRACE, if you look at the percentage of trades that we think is attributable to newly issued bonds and benchmark large deals, it's probably around 25% of total TRACE volume.",2.378663,-0.296
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,76,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's difficult to be exact, but it's a significant part of the market. We're active there today, but these protocols we think have a real chance to increase our share in that part of the market. Fee capture, of course is tied to bid offer and bid offer is tighter on these bonds. So we would expect that the combination of larger trades and lower bid offer would suggest that fee capture in this part of the market will be lower, but of course it's all additive top line revenue versus where we are today.",2.275641,0.834
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,77,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay, Rick. Just to clarify, should we be think about maybe half of the fee capture in high grade or is it something lower than that?",,-0.077
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,78,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's too early to know specifics on it. I wouldn't think that that would be too far off the mark, but those details are still in front of us.",,0.0

But in terms of volume, I think it's still only around 4% of your total volume which is up substantially year-over-year.",,0.718
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,80,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Kyle Voigt,KBW,Just wondering if you could help frame where you think that buy side Auto-Ex can go as a percentage of MarketAxess' total volume? It's something that in three years or five years it could be a quarter or a half their volume or more?,,0.47
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,81,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",Sure. I'll take that. It's Chris. We see client adoption across the board from most of the large fund complexes. Most of that adoption involves smaller ticket sizes either under $1 million or under $2 million. And most of the firms are getting comfortable once they adopt it.,2.0996094,0.743
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,82,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",We do see firms increasing to penetrate more of their trading activity across investment grade and high yield and we would expect auto-execution to bleed into other products as well.,1.5,0.273
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,83,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",If you think about munis which are much smaller trade size provided you're comfortable with liquidity and the liquidity on the platform and the price that we are delivering you get comfortable with auto-execution. So we see with the clients that have adopted it further penetration higher growth rates which would suggest a much higher percentage of our total volume being Auto-Ex.,1.9238281,0.848
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,84,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",I think it's important to point out that's that one side of the trade that is the client auto executing their Request-For-Quote and those responses. We still are looking at solutions similar to an auto responder where clients are able to respond to other Request-For-Quote.,1.2651367,0.361
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,85,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",So there are a variety of auto-execution solutions that we continue to analyze and we continue to hear from the clients that will drive auto-execution to a much higher percentage of our overall volume.,2.1962891,0.178

I know you guys have these opportunities kind of identified. I'm guessing project out and expect that launch here for a couple of launch in the fourth quarter. But if we look beyond that so I guess the kind of next wave of initiatives, what are areas of the market you guys are focused on that seem to be a little bit juicier or right for more investment over time?",,0.796
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,89,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I think the nice part about the credit space is we see ample opportunity for investment over the next three to five years. We are still in pretty early stages of electronification of the credit markets. Clearly Asia is an area of investment for us given the beginnings of greater electronic trading adoption in the region.",2.1089744,0.963
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,90,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we would also see electronic trading demand growing in additional credit products. We're at very early stages in municipal bond trading, but we like some of the trends and client input that we're getting for our muni bond product. The structured product marketing including asset backs and non-agency mortgages has opportunities to expand electronically.",2.1428571,0.925
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,91,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So we're looking at a broad menu of opportunities globally and we're matching that against increased demands for automation coming from both our dealer/investor clients.

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Rick, I would just add that we're seeing continued growth in our Request-For-Market where clients are requesting a 2-sided market versus single-sided Request-For-Quote. That's been a wonderful driver in Eurobonds and our Emerging Markets growth rates that you've seen here today.",1.440918,0.836
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,93,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",So we're expecting further investment in functionality similar to a request from market. And obviously investment in the Auto-Ex features that we just mentioned. I think that's a multi-year investment because clients continue to request small changes small adjustments as we rollout all these features.,0.8666992,0.0

Are you seeing anything just in terms of the competitive landscape in the Eurobond area?,,0.867
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,101,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think as we've suggested in past calls that European clients are responding to a couple of parts of our value proposition in European trading. And by the way, it's well beyond Eurobonds. European clients are extremely active in emerging markets trading on MarketAxess as well as U.S. credit trading.",2.375,0.881
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,102,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,But clearly the liquidity solution that we're offering is different from competitors.

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,103,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And I think that's a big part of why we're doing better in the European region. I would also point to data we're using data to drive trading activity and market share gains and we have terrific free trade price discovery and data products for European clients including CP+ which has been winning multiple awards this year. It's one of the best real-time pricing tools for the global credit markets.,2.4381868,0.978
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,104,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So I think that combination of a unique liquidity pool driving down transaction costs and high-quality reliable free-trade data is really changing the dynamic in the competitive landscape in Europe and it's a meaningful change.,2.5709707,0.706
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,105,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,You can see that with some of our competitors and the volumes that they are reporting that we are clearly taking share.

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,106,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Hugh Miller,Sidoti,Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just on the expense guidance the update there towards the upper end of the range. Is there an assumption just in terms of market activity in the second half of the year relative to the first half? And is it just the change primarily all driven by the increase in the business investments?,,0.825

When we freshened up the forecast for the rest of the year we're looking at the resources required to execute on all of these initiatives. Most of the uplift is people-related, although there is several other line items like clearing costs. Like this clearing initiative there is implementation fees, there is even some occupancy uplift in London. There is various employee benefit programs in transit.

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,109,Operator,2019-07-24,2,2019,Operator,,Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.,,0.727
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,110,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Yeah. Just -- Tony just a quick follow-up on the July volumes. You said that they were -- compared to last year they were above it, which is -- the volumes were very weak last year, but down from 2Q pretty wide range I guess. The point is could you get any additional color on volumes July-to-date?",,0.586
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,111,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So to give an upper end of the boundary there with 2Q we are at $8.4 billion average daily volume in Q2, and the commentary going to have to decipher what the word substantially higher means, substantially higher than July 2018. It's -- the market environment and the market volumes in July, while down seasonally from June and the second quarter, which happens every July market volumes are actually pretty healthy.",2.3449979,0.823
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,112,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So when you look at U.S. high-grade market volume month-to-date it's up about 5%. Now you have to remember, we have six trading days left and we also have the impact of July 3rd and July 5th in there. So market volumes are pretty healthy even in high grade. When you look at high yield emerging markets and Eurobond market volumes month-to-date, all three of them are tracking up more than 20% year-over-year.",2.1926719,0.71
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,113,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So, there is -- while we're saying that ADV is tracking below the second quarter, which will be very typical for July, remember we got market volumes in there. We also said that U.S. high-grade market share is tracking well above the second quarter. So hard to be not more specific than that, but we kind of put a little bit of a boundary on it for you.",2.800741,0.203
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,114,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And remember Rich, you see this across all of your market structure platforms, but at this point July, the two holiday impacted trading days July 3rd and July 5th are heavily weighting down market volumes, but that will improve as the month goes on. So, you did have two quiet days around the 4th, but the trends are really positive as Tony pointed out on market share. And overall, if you look year-over-year market share gains are looking really solid. So we're encouraged and the quarter is off to a good start.",1.1478938,0.987
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,115,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Got it. Got it. It seems like every Monday is weighing on market volumes as well, but anyway. The question I have is for Chris and as you go to a streaming platform -- I guess -- and it's for Rick as well. The question is how much of a market do you think -- do you think this will be a significant play? Or like say in U.S. equities where Chris comes from would it be like a small portion like dark pool volumes? Because it also seems like you have more competition in the streaming that have streaming platforms already, but fairly don't have the liquidity you have in the RFQ model? Just trying to see how much of a competitive -- how much you can take it? And how much of a competitive moat you have?",,0.973
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,116,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So it's a good question. Obviously, we think Live Markets is an important feature that we're delivering to the global credit market. It's something that our clients don't see anywhere else and they don't have access to something like it. So it is unique for the global credit market.",1.4306641,0.893
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,117,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We do think it will ramp up quite slowly as dealer's get comfortable pricing on a streaming credit platform and as clients get more comfortable using Click-To-Trade something that's new to them as well. I just think the innovation is really allowing clients to market their interest, their pricing interest in bonds. If you think about your average portfolio, there is an offer in that portfolio on every bond in the portfolio that has no place to be placed in the market unlike most other instruments that they trade in those large managed funds.",2.0961914,0.949
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,118,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So it is a unique innovation in the corporate bond market to allow an investor to reflect their pricing interest in a bond and have it sit either the full size or a small size with hidden liquidity behind it. So I think it's going to allow us to drive innovation across the bond market because of the functionalities that we can embed in that market once it's up and running. But again, I want to make sure it's clear like, we do think it will take time for this market to develop on Live Markets.",1.8759766,0.949
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,119,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We are targeting a small subset of other bond market, which is the most liquid end of the bond of market. And we're allowing an important functionality in the market. The Live Markets functionality is that dealers can stream their prices in and that's something we already see them doing in Request-For-Quote. They are responding with an automated market price. And so we're just allowing that functionality to bleed into Live Markets.",2.1791992,0.202
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,120,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Rich remember when you talk about competition for streaming, streaming today is primarily in the REITs market not in credit. So we believe that the network that we've established in the significant advantage that we have in client order flow gives us a great head start in leading the move toward more automated means of trade through Live Markets and streaming quotes.",2.547619,0.853
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,121,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So it's been a very liquid market phenomena so far, and we think now at the liquid end of corporate bonds, the market investment in automation means that it's ready to start moving toward corporate bonds.",2.1350733,0.361
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,122,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,Got it. One last quick question. Why would someone request a two-sided quote? Would it be simply just to hide their intentions?,,-0.264
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,123,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's primarily -- it has much less information leakage that the client likes to basically camouflage the side of the market that they intend to trade on and request a two-sided market. And by the way, we get positive feedback from the dealer community, because it works for them because you don't have the winner's curse where everyone knows which side of the market they traded on. So in certain products like EM, it's proven to be very popular with both investors and dealers.",2.1749084,0.871

I just wanted to talk a little bit about portfolio trading and maybe what the opportunity you guys see there. I presume, it goes a little bit hand-in-hand with your Virtu partnership. So maybe any color on REIT sort of volumes from both of those items? And if it will compete with, or kind of dovetail with ICE's intention to launch their fixed income credit rating ETF hub at some point in the future?",1.7893145,0.825
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,127,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Great question. The portfolio trading, we see portfolio trading happening in the market on an average trading day. We continue to hear from our clients, how they are constructing portfolio trades and putting up portfolio trades. Right now, the efficiency of that process just the workflow is very difficult for both client and dealer, because it's passing spreadsheets back and forth. What's unique about our portfolio trading solution is it's leveraging some of the functionality that we already have things like list trading. And it's allowing an investor to market a portfolio request prices across the portfolio on a single net basis, so they can market their portfolio at not just one dealer price respond, but multiple dealers price respond, which is a very important best execution functionality in the credit market.",1.7451172,0.952
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,128,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director",Then it allows for investors to manage that large portfolio and show it to dealers across our platform. So that's a unique solution. We continue to hear from our clients asking for the functionality. So that's one of the reasons why we are driving to deliver that.,1.7089844,0.374
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,129,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R.

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,131,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. We believe this is obviously capturing trades that are being conducted today in the market that we're not seeing. We do see parts of those trades really the follow-on. As the portfolio is unwound by a dealer, we'll see certain elements of that portfolio trade coming through our platform. But today, we see trades going up on TRACE that we're not participating in and that's really the driver to deliver this. It also will reduce the inefficiencies around the workflow for our clients, because it will seamlessly go through our trade reporting and our clearing solutions for our clients and flow back into their own assets. And so that's one of the drivers that we see the opportunity.",2.1132813,0.818

Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Now, we do think that it will allow for - because it is efficient, and given the growth of the ETF, fixed income ETF trading we do think it will allow our clients to trade more portfolios that they are not currently trading. So we do think it will create trades that don't - haven't happened in the market today.",2.1210938,0.852
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,133,Question,2019-07-24,2,2019,Jeremy Campbell,Barclays,"And Tony, I think you had mentioned that some of the expenses to build out the clearing the self clearing side of things is already kind of contemplated in the higher end of the 2019 guide. But I think it was also mentioned that self clearing is a bit of a lengthy approval process. So I'm just wondering is MarketAxess currently running with some sort of redundancies or is that yet to come at this point? Just trying to figure out, how much more it will cost to build out the self clearing versus the savings you're going to see there?",1.7137097,0.536
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,134,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yeah. So it's important to point out that the self clearing - the majority of the cost will not the variable cost, but the fixed cost to build out will be contained in 2019 meaning headcounts that we need to add people and employees and specialists that support the clearing function. Because of lengthy approval process, they expect to have all your people and processes in place and the ability to run tests trades through the clearing cycle, that all needs to be done at the front-end of the approval process. So I expect the majority of those fixed cost expenses to be incurred in 2019.",3.0564018,0.951
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,135,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"In 2020, when you make the switch you are running really a redundant self-clearing operation as well as outsourcing your clearing to a third-party that's when the switch takes place and really you see the benefit of reduced variable cost coming through and what we are predicting is first half of 2020.",2.9440099,0.625
MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,136,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Yeah. And just to follow on that we look at three to five year expense savings from trade settlement combined with the improvement in customer service. This is a very high ROI activity.

On EM, and we've talked about this in prior quarters as well, but we do think that the investment we've made now over 19 years is created a really unique global EM solution and the liquidity comes from a combination of the large global dealers active in EM, and importantly, in local markets a lot of the local banks that make markets in those currencies. So that - it's a time-consuming exercise to work our way around the world and now we have 26 active local EM markets. And you put the global dealers, the local dealers and in some markets now we're even able to apply the benefits of Open Trading and you have a really unique liquidity solution that's highly efficient for EM trading for our clients. So it is a combination there.",2.4757326,0.98

MKTX-2019-Q2-2019-07-24,143,Answer,2019-07-24,2,2019,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And I think in emerging markets as Rick pointed out, a key benefit for our global clients is the unique liquidity pool that we have amassed. These are local dealers quoting on a platform and the benefits for those local dealers is they have access to a network of clients that they would need to arm sales forces across the globe to obtain those clients.",3.1811445,0.681

And as you know Patrick, that is being done through their Bond Connect hub. We have increasing dialogue with the decision-makers at Bond Connect, both PBOC and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In addition to the growing automation story that Chris outlined, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are definitely benefiting from the influx of new significant market participants to credit that really couldn't participate in the old model. And not only have we seen a nice increase over the last two years, the pipeline of new participants that we see, that we expect to come in over the next two or three quarters is also meaningful.

Market volumes have been negatively impacted by the current low levels of bond yields, credit spreads and volatility. During these periods, price dispersion of bids and offers shrinks temporarily. Our liquidity and pricing advantage comes through most clearly at times of normal to high spreads and volatility. And we believe that there are many factors that could possibly impact bond volatility in the periods ahead.

The 9% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower US credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture. The 17% decline in US high grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, driven by the increase in bond yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. We also experienced some dealer movement to a fixed fee plan from an all variable fee plan, and this explains the increase in US hybrid distribution fees as fixed fee plans provided for higher fixed distribution fees, but lower transaction fees. Other credit fees per million was lower year-over-year due to a higher mix of emerging market and Eurobond volume that command lower fees.

But listen, we're starting to pilot a market conditions index and I said a year ago on this call that no one should expect a credit trading conditions of last year to continue indefinitely. I will say exactly the same this year from very low levels of volatility that you also shouldn't expect these levels of very low spreads and volatility to continue either. And we certainly as a more developed business are impacted by what is going on in the overall market.

One is the rapid transition of dealer to dealer trading, from voice based brokerage to electronic trading, and we see that as our competitors, we also see that quite clearly here with dealers initiating more orders into our open trading platform. So that's been one of the themes this year, as the dealer to dealer business has moved away from some of the traditional voice brokerage firms, it is now very actively deployed on the electronic trading networks, including our own. It's not, it has not been historically been one of our big areas of focus, but open trading is providing an entry point for D2D trading.",0.1222527,0.952

And the processing benefits for portfolios are significant. So given the large number of line items, electronic processing is critical to the effort. It does not today include new forms of liquidity, it is pure C2D trading and we are happy to see progress with clients and dealers utilizing our own portfolio trading solution.

I would just also mention that we do see differences in protocols in different environments, particularly protocols that involve a derived price protocols. And what I mean by that, if you have a price forming market, they suffer in low vol and tight spread environments, where you are deriving price from the market, things like mid-market sessions Low volatility environment, you'll see a gravitation to mid-market sessions or portfolio trading that are using end of the price portfolio trades in a fast market, in a volatile market, those solutions actually will lose market share. So overall we've seen in the past both portfolio trading and mid - mid-market sessions get hurt by volatility.

So I guess my first question has to do with, I guess, follow-up on the expenses. If you did increase headcount, I calculate by, I think, 5% or 6%. And if I back into the expenses and you stated you're going to continue to invest despite the low volatile and slow volume environment. But I am getting like a 17% 18% year-over-year increase in 4Q.

And I don't know what more you can say, you know, to give -- give investors sort of you know either time frame or what's typical here on the turn. But I guess that's one part of the question. The other is this regulatory environment. It doesn't look like it's so much focused on corporate credit, but [indiscernible] talked about a Treasury market review and then you get issues in China, at least on the -- on the brokerage side.

Rich, you managed to take a two question limit and make it a five question topic, which is totally fine, but happy to go through all those. But you know, the short answer on when do the market conditions improve for our business model is, we don't know, of course. But what we've done is we've looked at the last dozen years or so and we pointed out previously we did have similar conditions in 2014 and 2017, and really two quarters was a long time to sit at those low levels of spreads and low levels of credit spread volatility.",0.0970696,0.764
MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,46,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we're already beyond that today with the high grade spread index sitting in a 5 basis point range all of 2021 so far. So the history would say that we will see a change. And as I mentioned earlier, the ingredients for volatility are clearly increasing. Certainly, from my perspective, what we're seeing in - in wage pressures does not feel transitory, nor do some of the increases that we're seeing in energy prices. So there certainly our core parts of the inflation story that I think are longer term in nature and you still have the central banks, especially in Europe and here in the US, buying a lot of the net new issuance of government bonds and even mortgages.

MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,47,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I would expect that some of the excess liquidity that we have in the market will start to reverse relatively soon because you still have a lot of quantitative easing going on and you have certainly above trajectory inflation numbers showing up regularly now in the data.

We have no idea why treasury has not moved to increase transparency of the US Treasury market, given that FINRA now collects the data, just as they do for corporate bonds and high yield.

Clearly, Chair Gensler has a very busy agenda in front of him. We see topics like crypto and equity market payment for order flow, retail equity trading high on the list. But he does regularly mentioned fixed income transparency and potentially some improvements to the ATS regulatory structure, which we focused on at FinTech.

MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,51,Question,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hi, good morning. Maybe just on the automation slide and in the prepared remarks, you noted that the responses per inquiry continued to move higher. I guess I'm just -- just wondering, obviously, the environment is pretty benign from a -- from a credit and credit spreads and volatility standpoint. I'm just wondering how much of this kind of increase you think is secular? I'm assuming you think most of it is. And then I guess just wondering if you think there's kind of a tipping point here. Does this get over a certain response rate then all of a sudden customers just feel more comfortable executing and executing in an automated fashion?",2.3145604,0.96
MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,52,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, three questions. Our automation growth continues. It's really seen quarter over quarter growth rate, particularly in 2021. There are times of volatility where it will grow slower, but it's really based on client adoption and client penetration. And what I mean by that we're really going after the largest investment fund complexes that need automation to solve the multiple tickets and trading that they have on their desk. And so it's really a workflow solution. The increased penetration is really increasing the size that clients are comfortable using a no touch or low touch solution for trading credit and we're seeing those increase at the client level.",0.4207875,0.889
MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,53,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we continue to see growth, that's why it's achieved, close to 20% of our trading activity is now through no touch or low touch automation solutions, and it's now reached 7% of our total volume. We would expect that to continue to grow as clients continue to seek workflow solutions, particularly in a - in RFQ environment. There are benefits to open trading as a result of the adoption of things like auto responder, which is one of our key automation tools that we rolled out. It's allowing clients to actually participate in responses to other clients or other dealers, a request for price. So that's - it has having an interesting dynamic to the overall liquidity pool.",0.1662088,0.557

Second question is just on capital deployment, and so the stocks come back in now a year to date and obviously the operating environment has been challenging.

Our capital management strategy, the number one priority for us is to invest in the business and the goal of our repurchase program was to offset dilution from employee equity grants.

I was hoping maybe we could dig in a little bit further on the corporate credit side and just would be interested in your thoughts there and how you see the landscape evolving on the regulatory side and in particular there has been some noise around this Rule 15c2-11 just on I think initially it was supposed to apply to equities at least that was the thinking.",,0.797

It's a good question, because there's a lot of industry focus going into 15c2-11 in fixed income right now. And you're absolutely right, this is a 50 year old rule that was originally designed to prevent fraud and in equity OTC markets with retail investors and particularly penny stock show. It's been around for a long time and it's never really applied to fixed income and there was a change in the pronouncement of register -- Federal Register from the SEC recently that said that they viewed fixed income as being included in that 50 year rule and it did come as a surprise because there had not been any staff guidance or really discussion it did come as a surprise because there had not been any step guidance or really discussion about the rule previously and no review today before the change came about.",0.1117216,0.318

MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,62,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the challenge starts with what exactly is the definition of a quotation medium.

So I think when all is said and done, we're going to be into a very small sliver of the US market as that could be impacted by the rule and of course, we're hoping They could be impacted by the rule and of course we are hoping that will response to some of the industry concerns about really publishing quotes to promote transparency and in some cases, electronic trading that should be available for all fixed income securities and especially for institutional market participants.

And that's actually been very helpful in -- in the candidates that we're seeing and the sophisticated talent that we're able to acquire.

But certainly what shows up on the trace tape is 100% D2D. Portfolio trading is D2D today without really additional participants in the marketplace. So that is a C2D protocol and the newer entrant that is getting some media attention at Trumid. It looks to us like - and again, this is based on the TRACE tape and I think all of you have the opportunity to speak with them directly which of course you should do.

MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,73,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It looks to us like the overall protocol is flat year-over-year and all of the growth is coming from dealer direct. And dealer Direct is in early stages, right? And so when we talk to clients, it's the levels that are strained are not fully executable at those levels. So it almost always involves a negotiation on or off system to get to the point where there is a trade completed. So it's seeded trading with negotiation. According to market participants some of it process, some of it electronic. So when we really think about that seven years of investment that we made to focus on all of our protocols and all of our products and open all to all trading, we believe that our leadership there is significant and that benefit will come through when we see higher levels of volatility and price dispersion just as it did in 2020.",0.2106227,0.868

MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,75,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Good question. You know if look at the pure China bond Connect volumes, currently, you see the international activity levels at somewhere around $6 billion or $7 billion in turnover per day. Now on the one hand you know that makes it a large local market already with that volume. On the other hand, that's a very small smart part of less than 10% the daily market volume in the Chinese government bond market. And you know our view shared by others is that that international ownership will grow because it's highly likely that the Chinese waiting in the government bond indices around the world will continue to go up in the years ahead. So, those that are measured by government bond, global indices will be increasing their ownership in the Chinese government bond market.

So, in spite of the fact that we have lots of clients fully integrated to our platform that are ready to trade Chinese government bonds on market access, there is a documentation and onboarding process that we will go through.

High grade capture rate was down sequentially, and I know you cited some reasons like shorter duration, rising yields and dealer moving from variable to fixed. But can you provide us more color as to which of these three factors played a bigger role for the decline in capture rates? And how should we think of the jumping off point for 4Q?",0.9720696,0.915
MKTX-2021-Q3-2021-10-20,79,Answer,2021-10-20,3,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. This is Chris G, the high fee grade capture is -- there's a lot of variable factors that contribute to the month-to-month or year-over-year variability and, as you pointed out, a years to maturity, interest rate environment. The dealer fee plan all of those are main contributors, and those three items are actually what contributed to the year-over-year increase and if you had to prioritize it, the number one factor was the rising interest rate environment. You saw the 10-year treasury spread gap out, which was presented on our side for the market conditions stack. Rick pointed out there was shorter years to maturity. And I referenced in my prepared remarks that we had a number of dealers migrating from a fixed fee plan - from a variable fee plans to a fixed fee plan. And all of that, collectively, it's probably a 40, 30, 30 split on the composition of what was contributing to that $35 a year-over-year decline.",0.3260073,0.758

Overall revenue was up 11% year-over-year. The 16% increase in trading volume drove commissions 10% higher. The $1.1 million uplift in post-trade services revenue is primarily due to a combination of new MiFID II services and the new customers. Expenses were up 16% year- over-year, leading to a 6% increase in operating income. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 10%. The effective tax rate was 23.9% in the second quarter and 22.6% year-to-date. We expect the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will be within the 23% to 25% guidance range.",0.7929189,0.869

The $1 million sequential increase in U.S. high-grade distribution fees was principally due to one market maker moving to distribution fee plan.

At a granular level, fees per million for emerging market incorporates and emerging market sovereigns, European high-grade and high yield and U.S. high-yield, that trades on either a price or spread protocol, were all consistent with the first quarter.

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,34,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi, good morning. Excuse me. So first question, I guess, is on probably like you noted some of the micro-lot, fixed assets, you said you're having there, I think, it's mostly on the institutional side, obviously, but there are some retail assets you looked that last year, they didn't end up winning. But at that time, it sounded like there was analysis done regarding this build versus buy mentality for the retail space. And it sounded like you may be kind of looking at developing some point to quick the trade functionality for - to introduce this year.",,0.946
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,35,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Just wondering has that been an investment priority this year? And then is there something you anticipate rolling out more directly in the retail space, I guess, over the near to medium term?",,0.0
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,36,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, that's a good question, Kyle. Thank you for that. But I think we're very highly comfortable that our liquidity pool is among the most competitive for micro-lot trade sizes. We have not prioritized the investment in the retail segment in the first half of the year, but we continue to look closely as that opportunity that would involve some modest tweaks to the technology platform to suit the retail client segment and some improved focus on sales and marketing towards that community.",0.4184982,0.936

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,38,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay, fair enough. The second question will just be on Open Trading, just given the record percentage of your volume in the quarter at 21%. Can you just talk about, I guess longer-term, what internally, like what targets do you have? Or where do you think that can go as a percentage of your total market - of your total volume? And then I guess, what kind of timeframe do you think it will take you to get there?",,0.738
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,39,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I don't know whether we have a specific target on where Open Trading percentages will go. Our focus has always been on broadening and deepening our liquidity pool to better serve our clients. And the best part of Open Trading is it's the most important thing we think we have done to add new liquidity, and broaden liquidity pool and improve execution quality. So judging by the rapid growth in the last few years, we would expect Open Trading to be at significantly higher percentage of our volume.",1.0233516,0.929

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,41,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay. And then last one from me. Just to follow-up on Open Trading. You gave a kind of breakdown of Open Trading penetration between your different products. It looks the Eurobond and EM uptake of Open Trading continues to grow pretty rapidly from a lower base than some of the other products. Can you just talk about what's changed there in each of those buckets in EM and Eurobonds in the past year, whether it would be regulatory changes driving increased adoption, or protocol changing? I think you introduced may be local EM site. But yes, could you kind of highlight what's changed and what the outlook is there? Thank you.",,0.893
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,42,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, thank you for that. I think we mentioned in last quarter's calls that we have - call that we made some technology changes in Open Trading for Eurobonds. And that has made it easier for market makers to respond to Open Trading orders, and we've seen the benefit of that through greater Open Trading activity in Eurobonds. We've also introduced some new protocols that have been important to investors. So really, we think that's been mostly some technology enhancements that we've been able to deliver to make it easier for market participants to respond in Eurobonds.",0.0064103,0.944
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,43,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the EM side, I think, it's just organic adoption as the quarters roll on. And dealers and investors are seeing more trading opportunities available in EM in the open order book. The behavior is changing and we're seeing better price responses coming back. Most of it is in external debt. It is very difficult to solve the riddle around trade settlement in many of the EM local markets. We' re working through that one market at a time. But the bonds that trade and settle through Euroclear are significantly easier for our trade settlement than many of the local markets. So it is organic growth in EM, Open Trading activity primarily in external debt markets.",0.2435897,0.665

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,49,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"So not to beat this anymore, but tremendous success with the Open Trading. And I guess, what surprises me, and this is reflected in the other numbers as well as, but as the previous call said the penetration, but your volume in Open Trading was up quarter-to-quarter off the robust first quarter levels. So I guess, my question is how much - what's driving - from the first quarter to now, there had to be some changes to get this penetration, like what's the incremental change that actually saw your penetration go up so much, your volume go up in Open Trading when overall volume was down, I think, 9%, 9.5%?",,0.947
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,50,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think it's a sign as a growing acceptance of all-to-all trading in credit. It's really all cylinders contributing to the sequential growth that we announced this morning Rich, that dealer community is using Open Trading more actively for their own source of liquidity. It's an increasingly valuable tool for them to turn their balance sheets over more rapidly and move bonds off their balance sheet that may have become aged. Investors are responding to more trade inquiries as they see opportunities rolling through. And then, the third piece is really what I talked about earlier in trading automation and the increased use of algos, they can't go to work whether it's a disclosed inquiry or anonymous inquiry. So I think all three pieces of that are combining to create a much more valuable marketplace and source of liquidity for both our dealer and investor clients.",0.7696886,0.978
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,51,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"And again, not to get too deep into this, Rick, but, but the volume being up, but if you look quarter-to-quarter, again, the price responses were down. The 802,000 price responses down from 820,000 so we may be getting too far in the weeds in this. But just a last follow-up on this is block trading as a lower percentage - was it also the size of trades block trading being a lower percentage 2Q versus 1Q that helps Open Trading?",,-0.872
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,52,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, that could be a piece of it too. I think that's a reasonable observation. As I mentioned, I think, a very modest decrease in price responses had much more to do with market conditions than anything else. As you know looking at the other companies you cover, the second quarter was significantly quieter than the first. And we were the beneficiary of better interest rate and credit spread volatility in Q1 and the changing investors' sentiment drove a lot of short and block programs on the system and created the best block quarter that we had ever had.",0.5952381,0.929
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,53,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"That was not the case in Q2. You saw a much lower levels of volatility in both credit spreads and interest rates. I think I saw this morning that we had 21 days where the 10 year note was stuck in a seven basis point range. So it was just a different quarter, and I think that was the primary driver of slightly reduced trading activity levels across the platform and slightly fewer price responses.",1.3282967,0.34
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,54,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Got it, and just one last regulatory, I guess, sort of follow-up or question. During the quarter, the SEC Commissioner Jackson, who I know you know, talked in - I think he was quoted saying that the fixed income markets were - had conflicts of interest hidden costs and were - just did not provide a level playing field. You're on the fixed income advisory committee. And I guess, the question is, how much action - or what could we expect in the second half of the year in regards to regulation or, let's just say, the next 18 months in the fixed income markets since you are so close to it? And how would that - do see that benefiting market access and the electronic platforms?",,-0.141
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,55,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, well, thanks for that. And coincidently, FIMSAC just met a week ago, and the subcommittee that I chair on e-trading and trading and technology, made the one recommendation of the day this quarter for the SEC to really revisit and consider modernizing the regulatory framework for fixed-income e-trading which is currently fragmented because what you find is the platforms that have protocols that look closer to cross matching, primarily to retail platforms are regulated primarily as ATS systems and report their volumes as ATS.",0.9757326,0.743
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,56,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"However, the institutional market, which has favored RFQ protocols really does not fit with the current ATS framework whatsoever. So we are today primarily in regulated as broker dealers. And so we think that there - it is an important time for the SEC to focus on fixed income e-trading and make sure that they're mitigating risk around any systematic risk in the industry, make sure that the regulatory framework is consistently applied across all platforms.",0.9047619,0.387
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,57,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And what we recommended is that the SEC form a working group with FINRA and the MSRB to make sure that there is a thoughtful and consistent regulatory framework that emerges without redundancies. The other risks that we see is that if all three of them continue to regulate different pockets of the e-trading industry, there will be redundancies that really don't pass any cost benefit analysis. So that was universally supported by FIMSAC week and half ago. I think that led to Commissioner Jackson's comments, which you saw on Jackson's comments, which you saw on the media, and I do expect that this working group will be up and running and that there will be focus on this topic in the second half of this year.",0.7861722,0.836
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,58,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We view it as a good thing. We think that improving the soundness and best practices around e-trading for the entire industry will be a good thing for market participants in the U.S. fixed income. And we are highly supportive, we are regulated in parts as an ATS and parts as a broker-dealer and of course, as a public company with public reporting. So we are supportive.

And in the prepared remarks, I was commenting year-over-year on what drove that change, which is really due MiFID II related services and new customers associated with that. When you look at sequentially post-trade services was down around $1 million sequentially. And there's several items, all of them around a couple of hundred thousand dollars, which drove that variance. So we didn't have a repeat of some nonrecurring MiFID II implementation fees that was a couple of hundred thousand dollars.",0.9123096,0.494

That was a couple of hundred thousand dollars. And then there was - there are clients that are on variable plans where dependent on their volume activity, it does influence revenue as well.

And we do think over the next several quarters, the quarterly run rate will look a bit better than what you saw in 2Q.

If you look historically for that business strike, we've grown revenue around 10% per year. The vast majority of that revenues is recurring.

And in the second quarter, we were just a little bit north of 9%, which - that's pretty consistent with where we were in full year 2017. And really the main driver there, in the first quarter around the interest rate movement, principally right in the middle of the first quarter, there were a number of short dated selling programs in the marketplace. We saw a lot of that activity on our platform. We did not see a repeat of that in the second quarter.",0.745986,0.828
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,68,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Patrick O'Shaughnessy,,"Okay, great. And I guess, maybe a final question, a bigger picture question. So we've seen a lot of growth. It would seem like in some of the retail-oriented trading platforms, the ones that had the streaming executable trading quotes. And I think there is some data that suggest that the quotes are actually reasonably small, although maybe there is not a whole lot of depth of book at the inside quote. Do you think we're at a point where the market structure is ready for streaming quotes to move up market and for institutions to be able to - be willing to trade off of that type of protocol? Or do you think that request for quote is going to remain dominant trading protocol for some period of time?",,0.918

It's - I think you're seeing increased automation and trading at all levels of the client spectrum. Our understanding is that the retail and ATS system, the average trade sizes tend to be around $30,000 or $40,000, so it's very different business than the institutional platforms operate today. Most of what is streaming are offers on those platforms. The bid type, as we understand it, tends to be more RFQ.

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,70,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So to date, the evidence is that for the institutional market, they're getting more competitive levels from RFQ protocols. They've been able to trade on the retail platforms if they choose to for many years. And there's not much time that they've gone there at this point. And I think the reason is that right now, they see more competitive pricing through RFQ protocols. But this is something we have to keep a close eye on. We do have that micro-lot liquidity base, and if market makers and clients believe that they're ready for a full live environment, that is something that we have to be prepared to provide. From a technology standpoint, we think it's fairly straightforward for us to add that protocol. The message from clients today is mixed.",0.7032967,0.75

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,75,Question,2018-07-25,2,2018,Chris Allen,,"Thanks for the color on July in terms of the market share. I was wondering if you could give us maybe a little bit more flavor in terms of how the environment's shaping up relative to 2Q. It looks like volumes according to BondTicker for high-grade and high yield are down decent amount, but obviously, the July 4th week there. So any color just in terms of the July environment and maybe how the month has been progressing whether it's starting to pick back up, again, in the back half of the month or it's just consistent with the course of the month?",,0.511
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,76,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Sure, Chris. So it's been pretty typical July from a market volume standpoint. And when you look at the tepid trading around 4 of July, every year, we have that same anomaly. If you took the first, like, 10 trading days of the month versus the second 10 trading days, you get it, so why is the different answer. Right now, we're looking at U.S. credit looking at high-grade and high-yield market volumes compared to, say, July of last year at the same point in time, they are running about 5% lower right now. So a little bit softer, but I would just caution that we still have five trading days left here in the month.",0.8711404,0.59
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,77,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And I think not that I would guarantee anything, but I could pretty much guarantee that more than quarter of the volume is still ahead of us. There's still five days left, it's a 21-day month, and it was pretty slow and pretty unusual to have 4 of July fall right [indiscernible].",2.4796212,0.909

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,80,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And just to expand on that a little bit, Chris, over the medium term, one of the things that we're watching is the great unwind of quantitive easing around the world. The Fed has, obviously, stopped their quantitative easing program and allowing the balance sheet and bonds to slowly mature and wind down. The ECB should be on the quantitative easing by the end of this year, and you've seen some recent comments from the Bank of Japan. I personally think that's a big deal, right? That was a massive program collectively across the central banks around the world. They had been buying an awful lot of government bonds, in the case of ECB, quite a few corporate bonds.",0.514652,0.852
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,81,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So I think that that will actually be an important event in terms of the market environment over the coming quarters. And it will be interesting on the treasury side because the Fed is no longer buying treasury bonds and the treasury is about to start issuing a lot more bonds. So I do think that the likelihood is that the market environment will improve as we see this gradual unwind of quantitative easing.,0.9537546,0.863

One thing that caught my eye recently was recent reports just a news article about liquidity, particularly over in Europe, and corporate bond markets being a bit challenged, could be using more derivatives there in the credit markets.

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,83,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. In some of the European government markets, the futures contract have more liquidity than the underlying cash market. So that's been the case for a long time. So it's not surprising in a market like Italy when ball picks up that the primary beneficiary is the futures market more so than the cash market. Hasn't really been the case on the credit side. We did see slightly lower volumes during Q2, which we think is related to lower volatility. But we don't really see the same impact on the credit side.",1.2765568,0.823

MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,86,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes Chris, so the - when you look at sequentially, you're right. It wasn't a variable comp line. That was about half of the delta. And our variable compensation pool is very formulaic. So it's - it is tied directly to the operating income. So when you see revenues decline from Q1 to Q2, it does have a direct impact on the variable bonus accrual.",0.9444216,0.735

We do better when the order flow is more weighed toward bid wanted. We did see volatility drop in the high-yield market.

We're tracking about a 12 or13 different data aggregators in the EM that's faced currently and that numbers seems to grow every quarter. So there are more solutions out there.

It was an unusual fourth of July week with the holiday falling right in the middle of the week. And so I think if you look at the TRACE numbers, you'll see significantly lower average daily volumes in high-grade and high-yield credit during that week. If you look at the numbers since then, it's pretty close to normal. So I think this all balances out over the quarter, but it was an unusual holiday week with the 4th on a Wednesday. The only thing that I would reiterate and that comments that Tony already made on share that month-to-date high-grade share is running a bit below Q1 average and high-yield share is running significantly above the Q2 average. So we've got a mixed bag, and it's two or three weeks of trading, so I wouldn't read too much into at any case.",1.8182234,0.95

I guess, I think, most of us in the - we're trying to understand the volumes. I think everybody sees it down across the board and trying to figure out whether there's anything incremental beyond just July 4th seasonality and things like that. And - so I guess, the question is, do you feel like this is all - or do you think it's more a seasonality here with the volumes? Or do you think that as we go through this transition of quantitative easing that will - could go through a low in volumes before the market sort of takes over and steps in?",,0.816
MKTX-2018-Q2-2018-07-25,104,Answer,2018-07-25,2,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"See, I think in the short term it's seasonality. We're in July and we had a very soft week over the July 4, volatility is our friend. There is no question about that in our minds, when vol picks up we do better. And we saw a vol pickup in Q1 in both interest rates and credit spreads, and you saw the best results the company has ever produced. So we will do better when volatility is higher. And over the medium term, I think the odds are that both interest rate and credit spread volatility will be higher, not lower, but we're in a bit of an air pocket here right now where if you look at our treasury yields and credit spreads, they've been pretty stable over the last two or three months.",0.5224359,0.965

We have seen a few press releases, as you point out. What is notable about them is there is no consistency in the reporting of actual electronic trading volumes in most of the rest of the space. And we think it would add great value if recording became more consistent with established platforms and e-trading venues because, as you know, we see platforms commingling straight through processing volume with retail volume, with institutional volume and changing the time periods of their reporting on consistently.",0.0416667,0.873

So on the back of that success, we feel the time is right to move to a similar model in high-yield, and our feeling is that it is both a fair model and a scalable model. And the dealer response has been very good in terms of moving towards that model in high-yield and given the market share numbers that I mentioned earlier of our share of electronic trading in both high-grade and high-yield, the major dealers who are signing on to the new high-grade fee plan were very comfortable making those commitments.",0.0325092,0.964

It seems that the market share gains have slowed a bit in the second quarter. Just wondering if you could help us understand the competitive dynamics. It seems like you had such strong momentum since lifting those RFQ limits, the dealer limits, in early 2015. I'm just wondering what are you seeing in terms of competitor reaction and what's going on with the market share gains in that business?",,0.972
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,57,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. First of all, let me say that our European business is much broader than just euros. Our European clients are actively trading emerging markets, U.S. credit and euros within a system. In totality, we're still very pleased with the growth momentum we have in the region. We moved out in front with the MiFID II requirement to standardize our euro fee schedules. And in that standardization process, you have some winners and some losers in terms of dealers that saw fee reductions versus some that saw fee increases.",0.2257326,0.893
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,58,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we are working through those changes specifically in the euro product. It is possible that we will revisit a couple of elements in the fee grid to reduce any concern about any of the fee components in the euro schedule. But also remember, the European environment was not any different than the U.S. credits rating environment in the second quarter. The region saw incredibly low volatility throughout the quarter, and that clearly is also having an impact on overall trading growth rates.",0.1387363,0.661

And then maybe my second question would just be around the Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Just wondering, can you disclose if MarketAxess has been asked to be a part of that committee? And then I guess, like, it was pretty vague in terms of what Clayton wants to do within the fixed-income markets, but it's clear it's going to be a focus area for him as chairman. Are you hopeful that this is the first step toward some sort of best x standard? Or just wondering what are your expectations are here.",,0.959
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,60,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. I think in terms of your focus, what we've seen from other regulatory initiative is focus on best execution, transparency and trade reporting. And we would expect going in that those are some of the areas that the SEC will focus on as well. It's a little early to know what their primary emphasis will be. We are in regular dialogue with the SEC about all developments in fixed income and market structure, and we expect to continue those dialogues with them.

MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,61,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Okay. And then just last one for me, is really around pricing. And so just that the high-yield, I guess you have explained pretty well why you decided to make that shift towards the client markup model. I guess I'm wondering in your assumptions that you give us in terms of revenue capture and distribution fees. Can you also give us kind of the assumption that you have for Open Trading as a percentage of the total high-yield mix of that? I think that, that might be a little bit higher fee capture and if you can guess hash that out.",,0.735
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,62,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"And then just one separate question on pricing would be around distribution fees. I mean distribution fees in high-grade, I get that the client markup model is working in high-grade. You're continuing to gain market share and variable fees are scaling nicely in that business, and hopefully that translates to high-yield market as well.",,0.906
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,63,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"But the distribution fees, I think a lot of the dealers are getting access to multiples of the flow that they have just years ago, and the distribution fees remain fixed. Is there anything in the works? Or is there anything that you think longer term you may have a little bit of pricing power there? Or is there a different pricing structure, maybe more of a tiered model, you could go to for distribution fees? Just wondering any thoughts there be helpful. Thank you.",,0.704
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,64,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Sure. Kyle, it's Tony. You had two questions there: the first one on high yield and then around the high-grade distribution fees. In the high-yield side, what I mentioned the prepared remarks were based on the current volume and based on the current protocol mix that we expect that the high-yield change will be mildly positive to revenue. In those assumptions, what you see is almost 14% of our high-yield volume is in Open Trading. We're not changing the fee plan in Open Trading. And maybe a little less than 10% of our high-yield volume trades on spread, and that's a different protocol. We're not changing the fee plan there.",0.8456155,0.778
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,65,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So you have around 45% of our high-yield volume that when I mention again, that would be mildly positive. 45% of our volume, we don't have any fee plan push through. I will caution on one thing and I did mention that it was based on dealer contracts signed to date, and we still have several dealers that are considering the alternative plan. And this one, similar to high-grade, we have a plan that has a distribution fee, plus the markup, and then we have a plan which is all variable. It has an execution fee for each trade, plus the markup.",1.076163,0.557
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,66,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So depending on what dealers elect, you could see some swing in the distribution fee and you could see some swing in the fee capture. So we'll have to see how this plays out over the next several months. But based on what we know right now, we think the distribution fee will be around $1.4 million a month, and that fee capture will range from 350 to 450 per month - per million.",1.2202552,0.307
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,67,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The second question you had there, Kyle, was on distribution fees for high-grade. And Rick mentioned the beauty of the high-grade plan, the plan we put in place 12 years ago, and it scales incredibly well. And it promotes responses and promotes liquidity. We think we're in the right range. And you could argue that we have pricing power because the dealers are seeing multiples of the volume that they saw 12 years ago. But we have no current plans to change the distribution fees. Again, it is something that scales well. We're introducing it now with high-yield, and we believe that will be an impetus to promote liquidity and promote more responses on the high-yield plan as well.",0.9769452,0.937

I guess the tier that you talked about and the discrepancies that you talked about in reporting, Rick, I think the market acknowledges and we acknowledge, but still the pricing is much different. I guess the question is - and I don't think at this point your market share is still growing, but potentially it has a growth rate than impact. Not that it has grown, not that it's positive growth, but it does - it's slow - impact at all is growing as less fast just given this pricing. And by the way, from conversation with them, they certainly are willing to verbally disclose these things about the retail, about full electronic and the differences in reporting.",,0.935
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,71,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So a couple of things on that. First, Tradeweb is primarily a rates platform, so it is notable that they're talking about everything except their rates business. Secondly, when you really do try to decipher what they put out in press releases and split out phone trade capture, which is really trade processing and not electronic trading from their retail business and their institutional business, you clearly come to a very quick conclusion that we continue to grow much faster in the institutional credit business than Tradeweb or any other competitor. And if you look, Rich, at the first half of this year, our total volumes are up $180 million from the first half of last year, and our high-grade volume is up about $56 billion or $450 million per day in increase year-over-year.",0.58837,0.917
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,72,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So there is no question that we are widening the lead. And I think if Tradeweb wants to provide transparency, they would show a consistent and long-term trend of their retail business, which they are now commingling with institutional business in their press release. As you know, they bought the retail platform, BondDesk, which is now Tradeweb Retail, four years ago. I think the market would benefit from knowing what those trends are. Anecdotally, people say they're down, not up. Including phone trade capture is something that we do not do. We have more than $40 billion additional volume in U.S. credit and phone trade capture that we do not confuse with electronic trading volume and our reports to you.",0.1593407,0.586

MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,74,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Understood, thank you. I guess just the other question is, Tony on the sensitive that you put out last quarter on revenue capture, and that was just the variable pricing. Does that still hold given the price changes?",,0.361

MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,76,Question,2017-07-26,2,2017,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"That was high grade. Yes, high grade there. Okay, so all the high-grade variable capture from the prior quarter is still in place. Is that correct?",,0.557
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,77,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So what I talked about in the first quarter was if we had a one year change in maturity in high grade for high-grade trading, it could change fee capture by somewhere between $10 and $20 per million. If there was a 1% change in yield across the yield curve, that's going to be $10 to $20 per million. I think just following up on that and just to provide a little bit more transparency, right now, on high grade, the high-grade fee capture has been $162 per million the last two quarters. We think we're in the middle of the historical range of high-grade fee capture. So it's been as high as $200 per million. And if you look back historically and you overlay what we're doing in Open Trading and you overlay with our all variable plan, probably the low end of the range would be something like $125 or $130 per million. So we think we're somewhere in the middle right now.",0.8283244,0.477

And you can see that it's still strained from a volatility standpoint. Market volumes are down. New issuance, the best we can track right now, looks like it picks up a little bit in July. I think it's somewhat what Rick said, when you look at the underlying trend, with more clients engaged and more flow on the platform and Open Trading, percentage of volume conducted in Open Trading picking up, those underlying trends are all positive.

MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,83,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think that the percentage of trades that are traded or processed through regulated vendors will grow early in the new year. As we make the rounds with dealer and investor clients, the combination of best execution requirements for both investors and dealers and the onerous trade reporting regime has most market participants coming to a conclusion. That's just going to be easier to comply with those regulations when the trade goes through a regulated trading venue. There is a gray area which is basically phone trade capture, which trade takes place off venue and then be processed through a venue and achieve the same benefits in terms of trade reporting. And I think that remains to be seen, but there is some optimism that, that will be acceptable with the MiFID II rules as well.",0.0357143,0.94

But at a minimum, more trades will be going through MTFs. On data, we are - we have invested in and expanded our regulatory reporting offering to be both an ARM and APA in a new environment. We're especially pleased with the progress that we're making with large institutions within mandates for their trade reporting for MiFID II. So the set of data that will be available should be broader. Over time, I think there will be more and more transparency requirements where all regulated trade reporting entities have to participate in a consolidated tape.

MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,86,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So Conor, there is - with the new plan in place and again, remember, we're going to have a - for our major dealers, a distribution fee and then what is in effective fixed markup. As volume increases, if you were simply comparing fees under the old plan to fees under the new plan, revenue under the new plan would be lower as volume increases. But I'll give you one big caveat there. If you ask me what do fees look like if volume doubles in high yield, Rick and I would sit here and tell you, we're not sure what the current fee plan and if that scales that well.",1.02676,0.738
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,87,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And when you have individual dealers receiving bigger and bigger bills every month under the existing plan, we don't think that, that plan scales extremely well. But if volume doubles, for example - and again, I'm saying all things equal, protocol, mix the same and the dealer roster on the distribution fee plan versus the all variable fee plan, you could see something like a 5% or 6% decline in overall revenue if volume doubles.

We have different trading styles and abilities to contain that information leakage in, and client adoption is picking up. We think it's a big area for us. It's a big opportunity for us.

What we have done to really connect the global credit markets and introduce new and valuable counterparties to dealers, investors is really valuable. And people are seeing the transaction cost savings and the efficiency gains in block trading in the same way that they always have in $5 million under trades.

We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we continue to make progress. And we had comments in the prepared remarks that we have more clients engaged, more inquiry flow on the platform, we're executing more trades. We did close to $2 billion in the first half of the year in muni trading. And one of the positive things there, almost 50% of the volume was in Open Trading, so this was one of the reasons that we felt confident and comfortable launching trading municipal bonds. We thought we had something to differentiate our platform.",1.0621655,0.981
MKTX-2017-Q2-2017-07-26,96,Answer,2017-07-26,2,2017,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Open Trading is serving that purpose and half the volume has come through in Open Trading. There are significant transaction cost savings. Just like Rick talked about on the transaction cost savings in U.S. high grade. On the municipal bond side, we're measuring transaction cost savings in Open Trading, it's almost $0.50 or almost $500 per million in transaction cost savings when trading takes place through Open Trading. So we do feel good about it. It's a big market opportunity. Are we - do we wish we were further along? Yes, we do. There are challenges there. There's some headway in doing this.

DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Total variable transaction fees were up 28% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume, higher U.S. high-grade fee capture and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading commissions. U.S. high-grade fee per million was $18 higher on a sequential basis and $26 higher year-over-year, mainly due to longer duration. Average years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform hit 9.5 years in the recent quarter, compared to eight years in the third quarter of 2019. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $12 year-over-year, principally due to a shift among products favoring high-yield volume. Fee capture at the individual product level and product mix within other credit was similar to the second quarter. Total distribution fees were $1.3 million higher than the second quarter level, principally due to a rise in unused minimum fees and one dealer transition to a distribution fee plans.",0.4335117,0.93

The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. Clearing costs were up more than $2 million, reflecting the 41% increase in open trading volume and inclusion of match Principal treasury trading volume. The reduction in marketing expense for both the quarter and year-to-date is due to COVID limitations on sales-related T&E expense. We expect our full year 2020 expenses will be near the upper end of our guidance range or close to $314 million.

So now you did say that it would go down 30% per ticket. And I guess, I'm just trying to see, does that immediately hit in the fourth quarter? And how does that sort of aligned with the prior guidance, where I think it's been running at about 12% of open trading revenue? And I thought you could get it down to mid-single digits over time. Will there be any more progression in the timing of these savings for the self-clearing?",,0.945
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,33,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Sure, sure. Yes. So Rich, just a little reminder that clearing cost today, it's a combination of open trading-related clearing costs on our credit business, but also for treasuries, we do have clearing costs on the treasury side as well. And right now, in the near term, we're leaving that - the clearing model in place on the treasury side. And just again, by way of reference or background, clearing costs in the treasury side run, something like 25% to 30% of treasury revenue. And then on the credit side, that's what the number you were referencing on the credit side, we've typically been at about 11% or 12% of Open Trading revenue.",0.1268012,0.98

I'm getting - we're providing a little more clarity now saying that if you look out on a per ticket basis, which is really a better way of looking at the clearing cost on a per ticket basis, we think we can drive those clearing costs down by upwards of 30%.

You mentioned yield to maturity increasing. But just curious about sustainability and maybe update on October, if there's been any real change in terms of behavior on the activity side?",,0.893
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,37,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. So Dan, on the question on where can it go? The - on the high-grade side, there's a lot of factors that influence fees per million. We've got duration, which is influenced by years to maturity and yields. You've got trade size under our tiered fee plan. We've got dealer mix. We have dealers on distribution fee plans on all variable plans. And even on the protocol side, there are differences between disclosed RFQ, Open Trading, live markets, so there's a lot that goes into the mix, yes. What I would tell you, when you look at the third quarter, this is not a post-crisis high. We've seen years to maturity above 10 years post-crisis. We've seen if you go back to 2009, 2010, 2011, you had U.S. high-grade fee capture hovering around $200 per million. So it's tough to say where it's going to go. In terms of sensitivities, we've talked about this before, every one-year change in years to maturity, plus or minus $10 per million, if you had a one percentage point change in yields across the yield curve could be $10-plus or minus either way. So there's just a lot of variables into the mix.",0.1292713,0.561

Obviously, we're acquiring the arm and APA regulatory reporting business from Deutsche Borse. We do expect that deal to accelerate our margin expansion in the post-trade business. Obviously, it does add data into our footprint within our data business. The real value of that deal is how it scales exceptionally well onto our current platform. There are close to 500 clients within the Deutsche Borse's Reg Reporting Hub. And we plan to transition clients over a 12- to 18-month process. With some initial costs in the build for our platform to allow that many clients to migrate over during that time frame, but largely only adding minimal expenses to our overall platform to support the ongoing business migrating over from the Deutsche Borse Reg Hub. So we're excited about not only the current business, but also the opportunity to upsell those clients with additional services and obviously, extract the value of the data that all their data reporting can bring in the future.

On the revenue side, this business will add, year one, somewhere around $10 million in revenue. And as Chris mentioned, fairly high margins expected on that business, it's transitioning over there. That client base, there are some costs upfront to move through that transition, but we would expect this to be a fairly high-margin acquisition, upwards of 50% margins on it.

So you hit record market share last quarter, and it seems like these gains appear to be driven by several factors here, including more ETF activity, you've got a higher, probably high-yield names in the mix now from fallen angel, you also - it seems like you have new market participants creating a different slice.

Clearly, Open Trading is a key part of the high-yield liquidity solution that we deliver to clients. And that is not only improving the overall investor-client experience, it's also attracting more new market participants into our high-yield platform and more broadly into Open Trading. So you see a really healthy dynamic there where transaction cost savings are increasing investor-client order flow and new participants are very active in our high-yield product and as you point out, it's been growing hand in glove with the ETF marketplace in high-yield share trading.

On the muni business, obviously, I think a year ago, I was talking about our muni business and the excitement around it and certainly, if we look at this quarter, muni revenue grew 37% to $2.5 million in Q3 over Q3 2019. A key factor in the growth of our muni business, particularly in the tax-exempt muni businesses, our Open Trading solution. Obviously, Open Trading in munis grew by over 60%. So we're seeing a lot of that growth being driven by the Open Trading solution. Our penetration in Open Trading, for Open Trading in munis is close to 60% in our tax-exempt muni volume. So certainly, Open Trading is playing a key role in the growth drivers of our muni business. Obviously, we're adding more functionality, more dealers. We also launched the MTF in Europe for munis.

So we - I'd say we have some clear visibility on both of the transactions, clear visibility on what the revenue outlook is in the near-term. On MuniBrokers, it's - revenue for next year will be somewhere in that $5 million or $6 million or $7 million range. And the expenses will be a couple of million dollars, excluding amortization of intangibles. And just - we've talked about the Deutsche Borse deal, we've talked about MuniBrokers. And just to be clear, so we're not having to add up the pieces. We're looking at a revenue contribution next year somewhere in the $15 million to $17 million range.

I guess, first, can you give us a sense of the pipeline and the timeline for onboarding of other market makers and how many market makers you think you ultimately have in the platform? Secondly, in terms of pricing, could you help us think about where this is going to be priced relative to your standard RFQ protocol?

I'll jump on the live markets and what we're doing with dealers and market makers. Obviously, we announced the Goldman Sachs relationship on live markets where they'll be streaming live prices and are streaming today live prices currently across 132 bonds, most of the - most active bonds that we carry on the platform. Average sizes are around $500,000 per order, and its two-way streaming prices, so a full - a bit in an offer across all those bonds. That's an exciting announcement for us in that partnership, but we do expect others to join. Right now, there are close to 300 clients approved for live markets and 17 dealers approved for live markets. We expect a number of large dealers to connect to live markets for streaming pricing as well, and those plans are already in the work. So we're excited about what that market will look like in this quarter and into early next year, given the excitement from the dealer community and the dealer community is both large bank and non-bank ETF market makers that are excited about live pricing.",0.5859375,0.984
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,58,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The other exciting thing about live markets is a completely different dynamic. It is a click to trade solution, so you can click against those live prices, but more importantly, you can - a client can join the live prices trade at midpoint, add on either side of the market. So it does facilitate clients avoiding the cost of cost crossing spread. It facilitates clients leaving live orders available for execution. So it's really the dynamic of both the streaming liquidity coming from committed market makers as well as clients being able to use the live order book. With regard to pricing, Tony, do you want to cover that?",0.5,0.935
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,59,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So on the pricing side, we have different fee schedules for each product and protocol. And those fee schedules are typically set based on bid-offer spread. And the expectation around live markets, it will be - trading will tend to favor more on the liquid bonds and even larger trade sizes that have a tighter bid-offer spread. It's also a model where to promote liquidity, it's a liquidity taker pay model or market model to promote liquidity. We're incorporating some incentives or rebates for liquidity providers. So the capture rate is going to be lower than our headline, high-grade fee capture.",0.2552491,0.765
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,60,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"And again, not exactly sure where that will settle out once we're actively trading in live markets, but as we've said in the past, we view this as largely additive revenue since our share today in that addressable market tends to be lower. And Kyle, you asked that third part of the question around what is the addressable market? And then what's our share in that addressable market. When we look at newly issued bonds, say, the first four weeks of trading, it typically runs around 10% to 15% of trace volume. Second quarter was much bigger than that with a new issuance, but if you look at, you say, the third quarter or which was a more normalized from a new issue standpoint, it's in that 10% to 15% range.",0.0366406,0.453
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,61,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"The other piece where live markets is addressing is story bonds, actively traded bonds. Any given month or quarter, that could be another 10% to 15% of the addressable market. So you're looking at something like 20% or 25% where this is really targeted. Our share - as you know, our share tends to be lower in those newly issued bonds and most actively traded bonds. And I'll give you one - just one statistic would be in that first week of trading, where it's probably the most obvious one in that first week of trading. After new issue breaks, our market share is around 7%, 7.5%. It's up from where it was a year ago, which is around 5%, but right now, it's around 7% or 7.5%.

MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,63,Question,2020-10-27,3,2020,Christopher Shutler,William Blair & Company,"Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. First, on live markets. Do you view live markets as creating new liquidity in the market and helping secondary market turnover? Or is it a more efficient way to trade we are already pretty liquid bonds? And then secondly, maybe just an update on your market share of block trades 5 million or above.",0.5376973,0.905
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,64,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So on live markets, it's - honestly, it's both, right? We are aggregating new liquidity, streaming liquidity in the credit market is new at institutional sizes. While there are retail platforms out there that provide live liquidity, this is new because it's institutional size with institutional access. So it's a new type of liquidity that we are placing on the platform. It also allows, as I mentioned, clients to provide liquidity as well. So it's an efficient way for clients to provide liquidity outside of the traditional RFQ solutions and responding to RFQs because it's always live and available for a client to post. So, it is - we view it as new liquidity. Obviously, it is more efficient to use a click to trade solution to access in seconds a quote versus running an RFQ. So the efficiency is great. It also is attractive to some of the new participants that we see coming into our market. Obviously, hedge funds and quant funds are much more attracted to an order-based platform versus an RFQ based platform. So in that respect, it is attracting new liquidity given the new participants that we see accessing our market.",0.4569597,0.987
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,65,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And then, Chris, on the market share for block trading, it was right around 10.5%, which was just about the same as it was a year ago. But when you look under the hood, the encouraging part there, our market share in longer-dated paper, in block trades was up. Where we saw a little decline was in short-dated paper. But if I - on short-dated paper, block trades, our market share is 26%, and it was down a little bit. So there's a little bit of an offset there. There's - you could see with the years to maturity, a little - there's less trading, at the shorter end of the curve. Market share was down a little bit, but the long-dated paper market share was up.",1.0253906,0.329
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,66,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would just conclude, Chris, by saying that there are many reasons to be optimistic about long-term turnover and velocity in global credit markets. Clearly, open trading is reducing transaction costs but also bring many new and important market participants into credit. And then the stats that Chris shared earlier on the significant growth in automation with dealers embracing algos and clients embracing Auto-X feeds into the mix and our thoughts on velocity. And then the important trend that's going on with the indexation of fixed income and the growth in ETF assets, that really creates a new basket tradable form of fixed income trading and not only creates more activity in the ETF shares, it creates more activity in the underlying bonds. So when we put all that together, we start to see a positive story emerging on long-term growth in market turnover and trade velocity in the years ahead.",0.1575092,0.992

I was hoping you guys could provide a little bit of color on the composition of the Open Trading book. Obviously, that's been a very strong growth driver for you guys. But maybe a little bit of color on sort of the mix of liquidity providers that are in there today versus maybe a year ago, so it sort of kind of what's more systematic or ""high-frequency trading"" market makers versus some of the traditional players? And any color on the relative size of trades in the Open Trading book versus the rest of the credit platform?",,0.969
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,69,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, happy to do so. The good news is as all aspects of open trading are growing. And I'm especially encouraged when you see our dealer initiated volume continue to grow, where we think we're providing an attractive liquidity outlet and solution and additive distribution for the dealers on MarketAxess, as they think about sitting in the middle of more client trades and doing so with less balance sheet, we're also seeing movement with long-only investors providing more liquidity and you see records on both sides with dealers initiating orders and investors responding to orders and being price providers on the platform. There is an important trend in terms of the percentage of Open Trading volumes still emerging with the new market participants. And each quarter, we've not only seen more new names, we see existing participants getting larger. So there is a trend within liquidity provision where those alternative market makers and liquidity providers continue to get larger as a percentage of the total.",0.364011,0.956

MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,71,Question,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Repetto,Sandler O'Neill,"Yes. Rick, so one question on market structure. And I know you sit on the fixed income market advisory committee. Could you tell - there was some recommendations to - for the SEC to have a regulatory framework for electronic fixed income trading as well as to define what electronic trade is. And I guess, could you sort of to summarize what the purpose of that was and what changes that might occur if they adopted the proposal of this FIMSAC committee?",,0.586
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,72,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. No, happy to, Rich. Thanks for the question. But we're about three years into our work as an industry advisory group with the SEC on FIMSAC. And really pleased that Jay Clayton and their commission took the initiative to invite the industry and to advise them on areas where the regulatory environment could be improved in fixed income to help with market transparency and liquidity and resiliency and really some important recommendations have emerged from all the subcommittees over the last three years. This particular one has to do with the fact that today, there really is not one common regulatory framework across all fixed income electronic trading venues. And as a subset of that, there really are not any clear reporting standards for reporting volumes in fixed income electronic trading.",0.2165751,0.963
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,73,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I personally believe that the committee supported that view that there's room for improvement there that would benefit all market participants if we can move toward a common framework for regulation in general and for electronic trading volume reporting specifically. And what's unfortunate today, Rich, is I think many people assume that when they see a press release from one venue that they can compare it directly with others, and that's just not true. Every venue has unique practices in terms of how they report their volumes. And there are tons of inconsistencies that emerge. Some are reporting through ATS, others are not. Some report single dealer volume with multi-dealer volume, some are reporting trade processing with electronic volumes. So it makes it very difficult for analysts, for investors, for dealers and even for the regulators to know exactly what the trends are in fixed income electronic trading in general and within individual venue specifically.",0.2696886,0.582
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,74,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And so the recommendation was really, why can't we create standards that would make everybody's job easier to really understand what's going on with electronic market share and transaction costs across the industry. And we're hoping with that, that we'll get to something that looks more standard, but it's anything about that today. And I just would also point out that there is work going on in the private industry to help dissect the various reports. And I would point to Kevin McPartland and Greenwich Associates for the work that they do because they try to really talk to all the venues to understand what they're reporting. And then equally important, they have an industry advisory group themselves. They describe their experiences and how the different venues work and what they are reporting. So they're trying to aggregate all that information into a standardized monthly report now. And I would - I think what they're doing is that - is the best thing that's available now to get through all these differences that exist currently.",0.1817766,0.948

MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,77,Question,2020-10-27,3,2020,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Hi. Yes, just a couple of follow-ups for Tony. Just on the self-clearing, I think you mentioned that over $200 million of cash has moved over to support the self-clearing operations. Can you just give that number again and talk about whether you'd expect that level of cash to have to grow with Open Trading or whether that will be more fixed in nature?",,0.691
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,78,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Right. Yes. So Kyle, we're - a couple of things in the mix there. So we've always consciously held excess capital in our regulated entities. And that's really to help clients get comfortable when they opt to trade through us. And it's also to cover any potential credit losses. We haven't incurred any credit losses, but we've always kept excess capital there. The big item now is we're also holding excess capital. We have capital and use right now to meet any liquidity needs and any potential spike in Open Trading activity or volatility or any sort of activity from our clearing experience. On self-clearing, it doesn't impact our minimum regulatory capital requirement, but there's a big uplift in regulatory reporting and our daily position monitoring, these new deposit and reserve requirements. So we've got a customer reserve with FINRA. We have deposit requirements with the clearing houses and our settlement agent banks. And also, we're putting money at use to facilitate trading at DTC.",0.2696583,0.598
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,79,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Today, those numbers aggregate around $260 million. That could change. Again, it could change with Open Trading activity. It could change if there's volatility, it could change if our settlement experience changes. But right now, we feel like we have sufficient capital to meet the needs. The broker dealer's already well capitalized. We also have a $200 million collateralized loan available with our settlement agent. We have our revolving credit facility at the parent company level. So we think we're more than sufficiently capitalized. We also - just to put it in perspective, we ran some simulations around the activity in March, where our Open Trading activity was elevated. It was two times where it was in the third quarter. Volatility spiked for a number of weeks there, particularly in March. And even with the estimated increase in our deposit and reserve requirements, we think it's all manageable within our current capital profile.",0.6249485,0.832
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,80,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So again, we think - short answer is we think we're sufficiently positioned from a capital standpoint, even if we see spikes in volume or volatility.",0.0349938,0.0
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,81,Question,2020-10-27,3,2020,Kyle Voigt,KBW,"Got it, thanks. And then just lastly, the distribution fees, you mentioned, I think there was one dealer migration, but there's also an increase due to unused minimums. Was the majority of the sequential increase related to the dealer migration? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is sustainable on a run rate basis? Thanks.",,0.901
MKTX-2020-Q3-2020-10-27,82,Answer,2020-10-27,3,2020,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Yes. Yes, sure, Kyle. So it was more weighted toward the unused minimum fees. And just in terms of sort of caution around guidance, we do give dealers the choice of fee plants, in particular, in U.S. high-grade and high yield. We have a distribution fee plan, we have all variable plans. And then most products have a dealer monthly minimum fee commitment. So because we give dealers choices and because the unused minimum fees can vary period-to-period based on activity, it's hard to pin down the forward-looking forecast. But right now, we aren't tracking any dealer movement in the fourth quarter. We're not tracking any fee plan changes. So we would expect the fourth quarter distribution fees to be similar to the third quarter with one caveat, and that's around these unused minimum fees. So that could cause a swing from period-to-period. But from, say, the pure distribution fee line, the fixed monthly fees, we don't expect any change there into the fourth quarter.",0.4433923,0.836

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,31,Remarks,2022-01-26,4,2021,Christopher Neal Gerosa,CFO,The sequential decrease in other net is due to foreign currency transaction gains that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.1% in the fourth quarter and our full year effective tax rate came in at 22.8%. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and return to provision adjustments related to new state income tax filing requirements.

The 11% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower U.S. credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture. The year-over-year decline in U.S. high-grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, which was driven by an increase in yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. The year-over-year increase in other credit distribution fees was due to the migration of certain dealers to a high-yield fixed fee plan from an all-variable fee plan and $1.2 million of subscription and license fees from the MuniBrokers acquisition.",0.9381616,0.758

So first question is, I guess, for Rick and I guess, the non-Concannon Chris on expenses. So it's an 11% increase at the midpoint similar to the 10% this year -- this past year. I guess, the question is, if revenues were either significantly up and we get volatility and spreads widening or if it was flat to down if we get more of the same, how could that -- how variable could the expense guidance be? I guess, how could you move expenses?",,0.861
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,45,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Christopher Neal Gerosa,CFO,"Yes. Rich, thank you for the question. If you noticed, we did widen the goalpost in this year's guidance range from last year, it was around $20 million. This year, the goalposts are $30 million, recognizing that favorable or adverse market conditions can drive our variable expense up or down.

The great opportunity around our post-trade business is it is a resource of data for our information services business. So phenomenal resource of trade data across all of Europe.

It's kind of interesting because even in the last 2 months with a very slight increase in volatility from the end of November through this week, we're seeing portfolio trading percentage of TRACE decline. And that period has been closer to 4% or a little bit more of secondary trading in TRACE. So we're starting to see that it gets more difficult for dealers to manage the risk in large portfolios when there is a pickup in volatility.

It's highly unusual to have two years in a row like that. And my belief is that at the end of quantitative easing from central banks around the world is a big deal.

So it feels like most of the movement we've seen in capture rate has been really a function of the mix and not so much direct kind of pricing changes. As you continue to evolve the business, are you starting to see any changes in pricing from a more competitive perspective across all the kind of asset classes that you guys trade?

So the small difference is actually explained by the much larger high-yield and EM franchise that we have relative to that competitor with higher fee capture in those product areas. So there really aren't significant differences in the fee capture when you look at the blended rates that are being communicated publicly.",0.3571429,0.717
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,82,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With respect to PT, we think we're very competitive on pricing. And really, when markets get more volatile, our Open Trading cost savings go up. So we're delivering more value to the clients due to the transaction cost savings, which is why we've had a very long track record of maintaining our pricing.",0.6149267,0.777
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,83,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then the last thing I'll say is that there is a new pricing scheme in our space as well, as you know, broadly communicated by dealers and investors that Bloomberg has started to charge transaction fees. And when we look outside the U.S., Bloomberg has been our biggest competitor. So the fact that they've gone from 0 transaction fees to now charging and doing something more comparable to what we've always done is actually a benefit to us on a competitive basis.",0.422619,0.7

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,85,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we feel good about our pricing relative to the value we deliver back to our clients and even in an incredibly benign year for credit trading, our transaction cost savings were very close to total transaction fees. So we think that the value for money equation holds up very well. And the large banks, as you know, favor the fixed fee and markup models that we have here in the U.S. So we think we're in a really good place around our fee models.",0.4606227,0.961

And obviously, given the pickup in rates volatility and the movement rates we're seeing across the board, that should bode quite well for volumes this year.

Those two offerings are combined side-to-side, which makes it quite attractive for our clients to decide if you're trading a more liquid product, you can trade it in real time on a live market. If you're trading a less liquid off the run product, you can trade it via a traditional RFQ, which is really offered by the competition. So we have quite sizable goals in that market, particularly given our offering is an all-to-all live order book with an all-to-all RFQ supported by our all-to-all marketplace.

The U.S. Treasury futures market has been trading in an exchange order book for decades. And we think everything we hear from both dealers and investors is they welcome a new offering with an order book because of the additional flexibility and the additional distribution through this very wide client network that we now have installed on MarketAxess. So we're super excited about it. We recognize that we have to have the RRP offering as well, especially as you think about off-the-run treasuries.

And I also think that the Mid-X offering in the U.S. is all-to-all from day 1 of the launch. I just want to confirm that.

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,95,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Christopher R. Concannon,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. Great question. Mid-X is by definition all-to-all. It leverages that all-to-all marketplace. So it's a fully anonymous where anyone can participate in that match. In our European -- our Eurobond Mid-X offering, we saw a $3.2 billion in Q4 volume. Sizes of -- average trade sizes or match sessions are still quite sizable, close to $300 million. So we continue to see demand for a session-based trading in Europe. It is particularly dominated by dealers unloading inventory. So it's truly a -- first a dealer-to-dealer offering. Clients are still taking their time engaging the Mid-X solution.",0.5649414,0.915

Again, that's really a dealer solution for dealers to exit inventory, unwanted inventory using the traditional RFQ through the Open Trading network. Mid-X is just now launching here in the U.S. We're excited about offering a session-based solution to dealers here in the U.S. as well. And we continue to hear demand from our dealer community on a session-based solution for them to load large amounts of inventory looking for a mid-market priced execution.

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,97,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,I would just expand on that with one other piece. There's some interesting similarity between the market environment that seems to work well for sessions in the market environment that works well for portfolio trading because sessions depend on a relatively matched order book of buys and sells and a lot of confidence in a model-driven mid-market price. And those two things decline when volatility picks up.,0.1959707,0.889
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,98,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if you look back at Q2 last year in 2020, when you had very high volatility, those protocols did not work as well.

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,99,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So these protocols are the best position we can be in is what exactly what we're doing, and that's to offer the whole range of protocols across our entire network all supported by Open Trading. And there will be times where the Open Trading RFQ is the dominant theme, and there will be other times where portfolio trading and matching sessions work well.

MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,100,Question,2022-01-26,4,2021,Kyle Voigt,,"That's very helpful. And then I just had maybe a bigger picture question on treasuries and treasury market structure. Obviously, as you noted, it's still very bifurcated market structure between the dealer-to-dealer space and the client-to-dealer space and you're trying to kind of bridge that. I guess, I'm just -- I just wanted some more clarity on two pieces. One, do you think there's going to be any real material regulatory change in terms of there's been a lot of talk about treasury clearing? Do you think that's realistic to get some sort of proposal this year? I guess, what are the expectations there? And will that help kind of this transition to all-to-all whatsoever or are you the solution, and basically, you don't think that that's going to have a big impact to the adoption of all-to-all in the treasury space?",,0.946
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,101,Question,2022-01-26,4,2021,Kyle Voigt,,"And then secondarily, just in terms of a lot of other platforms, I think, have tried to launch more all-to-all solutions in this space before trying to open up some of the inner dealer offerings to buy-side clients. But it sounds like you're really encouraged by the uptake you're seeing, and it's kind of a rig opportunities, right, for these buy-side clients to be more engaged and actually use the platform and there's a lot of appetite for that. So do you think it's just -- the times come for that, or is it just you're hearing more louder cries from the buy side that they really need this? I'm just curious to get a bit better sense of what your clients are really talking to you about in terms of the desire for that all-to-all offering?",,0.937
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,102,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So Kyle, two very different questions, but on the same topic. But first, on regulatory focus. There is a lot of regulatory focus on the U.S. treasury market. As you know, in fact, I think as we speak, there's an SEC call, a public call going on about ATSG, which is the rulemaking that they're undertaking around the new category within ATS specific to the government bond market. And I think the observation is that the fragmentation in the market has not worked particularly well at times of very high volatility, and there have been significant gaps in pricing and liquidity that are really important to U.S. treasury into the functioning of all fixed income markets because the U.S. treasury market is the benchmark for the entire world.",0.1332418,0.82
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,103,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we think that the regulatory focus will remain favorable to all-to-all trading solutions. And some of the thinking around that is that central clearing would be a good outcome to help to support all-to-all trading as well as less risk in the settlement process for U.S. treasuries. So we obviously have been the most successful Open Trading platform without central clearing for corporate bonds, and we've been able to support that successfully with our own settlement solutions.",1.1295788,0.975
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,104,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But longer term, I think there's a lot of benefit to centralized clearing solutions. And there's a foundation at DTCC to be able to help to promote that down the road, and we'll have to see how the regulators view that. But we do see some potential benefits of moving in that direction.",0.3667582,0.891
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,105,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As far as -- I don't think you've ever seen a foundation like ours that already had success in Open Trading, has 350 or 400 dealers and 1,700 clients all connected with order management system connectivity and counterparty authorization to trade through MarkeAxess before in any of the other offerings. So we have liquidity. We have a very broad client network that's already -- that has the OMS connectivity, has the counterparty and settlement agreements already done.

And as we've seen, it takes a long time to build that up, and we've been at it -- we're starting year '22. So we have that network already built up.

Trading volumes in other asset classes have been reasonably healthy. And related to that, how have TRACE volumes typically fared during periods of Fed rate hikes?",,0.8
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,109,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So I think that part of what's going on is the risk-off mentality. But the reality, Patrick, is that the volatility that we've seen recently has been mostly focused on the rate space. So we have price volatility in the corporate bond market, but we do not yet have much spread volatility. If you look, there's been a modest widening of credit spreads from where we were for the two or three quarters leading into the end of last year.",0.58837,0.723
MKTX-2021-Q4-2022-01-26,110,Answer,2022-01-26,4,2021,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So my expectation is you're more likely to get both throughout this year, but credit spreads have been pretty stable so far. And we do notice from the Fed data that the dealer balance sheets are pretty low right now. They were going into year-end, as you would expect, but they remain low in the weekly data that we've seen pretty recently. So I think there's a -- certainly a chance that this is the calm before the storm. But I do think right now, the volatility has been focused on the rate space more than it has credit spreads. And I would expect that we'll see better turnover in credit products when we see better volatility in spreads.",0.1268315,0.991

When you think back in periods where the Fed has been hiking, so 2015, 2016, was that like generally a favorable environment as you guys were kind of looking at thinking about market share trends and industry-wide volumes, or what are the puts and takes as you kind of think about what might happen as the Fed potentially raises during 2022?",,0.778

I can tell you, there's a very clear correlation between the periods where we've done the best with market share and revenue growth and volatility.

As you know, the managed fund industry is certainly very focused on cost and it's not only cost of their own infrastructure but it's cost of trading and trading cost generally.

And given the range up - I think it's 9% of 15% I believe is the full range. But if you sort of look at that midpoint and I know you had to pay the signing bonus here for the free agent.

I mean, you guys know that January volumes since you weigh up, market share kind of came in. Maybe the issuance levels were basically nonexistence for most of the month. Is this kind of a function of people just kind of prepaying for issuance until the market is kind of came back or just any color on that would be helpful?",,0.66
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,80,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. New issuance is actually been pretty decent this month. It's not at last January's levels, but the capital markets have been open and the inflows have been helping to support new issues at tighter spreads. But similar to the equity markets, if you really look at the trend in credit spreads, there was consistent widening going on for four months toward the end of 2018. And literally in three weeks, we reversed half of that move. So this went completely the opposite direction with respect to risk on.",0.2431319,0.933

We give dealers the choice of plans, and some have a distribution fee, some are all variable or have an execution fee. So, it's tough to predict. I'll tell you, just looking at the fourth quarter, when you look at that small change for U.S. high grade in particular, we did have one dealer migrate to the distribution fee plan in the fourth quarter.

On the ETF side, you're exactly right, they are important components who are high yield trading. And while the fourth quarter, the percentage of volume represented by the ETF community was up it was not up appreciably. And what that tells you is that we had growth from traditional long-only clients and from the ETF community.

MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,102,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Antonio L.

Rick, I think you maybe alluded to this but is that going to be a significant area of investment when you talk about investing in new protocols.

MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,134,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"It's tough to look out. If we had a crystal ball, even that it's tough to look out beyond the next year or so, I think there is leverage in the margin, in the business. I think it's more about growing the top line. It's more about growing market share, adding new products, monetizing more on the data side. That's where we'll see the leverage come through, and market conditions are supportive, and Open Trading is a bigger piece of what we're doing. That's where we'll see the margin expansion coming through.",0.5155678,0.732

MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,137,Question,2019-01-30,4,2018,Hugh Miller,Sidoti,"Just have a question. You guys obviously have historically from quite a deal of trading seen a difference between the spread widening versus tightening scenarios in terms of the hit rate. I was wondering, as we think about growth in Open Trading, does that play a factor in that type of scenario with client-to-client trading in terms of the hit rate for buying versus selling or is that still similar to what we've seen in client-to-trade trading?",,0.612
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,138,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Hugh, I can't say there's been a big change in overall hit rates, whether it's on the offer side or the bid wanted side. You know we have this the dynamics. We typically the hit rate is higher on the bid wanted side versus the offer wanted side. That trend or that difference has continued to play through.",0.4858059,0.542

MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,141,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Sure. I'll take that one Hugh. But fourth quarter was interesting because the level of spread widening I think caught the market by surprise during the quarter. And there was a fair amount of interest in reducing credit risk by investors and dealers. So we did see a nice uptick in dealer-initiated Open Trading order flow.,0.3479853,0.929
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,142,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Richard Mitchell McVey,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,And I think what you're starting to see is that this is becoming a very attractive liquidity pool for the dealer community.

And I think in the prepared remarks you guys had mentioned, obviously, you gave some color in terms of the benefits from open trading from a dollar standpoint. But I think you mentioned that you're seeing roughly about a 2.5 basis point benefit in open trading for U.S. high grade relative to trades not through open trading. I was wondering is that a correct way that I have that? And as well how has that changed over time from the onset of open trading?",,0.888
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,147,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"So yes. That's what Rick in the prepared remarks mentioned the 2.5 basis points, and just to put that into dollar terms on average every basis point in yield is somewhere around $750. It's a rough number. So 2.5 basis points you're looking at about $2,000 per million in savings.",0.172499,0.636
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,148,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Antonio L. DeLise,CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,"Rick didn't talk about the high yield number. That was closer to $0.28 or $2,800 per million notional trade in the fourth quarter. Across the board the fourth quarter and the reason why you saw that big jump in the savings not only were OT volumes up but the capture or the savings or the price improvement across each product was also up in the fourth quarter.",0.9958831,0.631
MKTX-2018-Q4-2019-01-30,149,Answer,2019-01-30,4,2018,Antonio L.

And you're right there are lots of things that go in the tax rate. There's the mix of income by jurisdiction. There's permanent items and credits and then there are these discrete items like the excess tax benefit. If we pull out the excess tax benefits from 2018, the rate would have looked more like 23.5%. And I think what we're guiding to right now if you pull out what I said again the prepared remarks around $6 million in excess tax benefit, you're going to get back to that that mid 23.5%.",0.4845615,0.958

And I guess the question is, and this follows on to the automated execution, someone referred to that, I know you build on the liquidity side with the electronic liquidity providers, but do you also have to get the buy side here to also buy in and move more to the automated execution if you really want to grow Open Trading volumes?

But I think that this is the first in a series of steps that the buy side is likely to take with automated means of trading and credit.
