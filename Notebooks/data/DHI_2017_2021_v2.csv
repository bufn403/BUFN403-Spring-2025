Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"As a result, we continued restricting our home sales base during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. We expect to approve the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30th, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position holds very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions.

The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the broad strength of the housing market and benefited from the better alignment of our sales order pace to our construction schedules. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities.

I guess my first question relates to your Company's comments about affordability. I guess first, am I right to think that you're driving affordability primarily through construction into design efficiencies? Or should we think that this operates is going to imply a lower gross margin? All things held constant? And then, regulated to your margin, I imagine you got peak lumber coming through your December quarter. So if lumber stays where it is right now, would it be reasonable to think that the December quarter margins is maybe likely to be the low point for the fiscal '22 year?",0.8258404,0.915
DHI-2021-Q4-2021-11-09,50,Answer,2021-11-09,4,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Well, in terms of lumber cost, that they are still rising. They rose further in our fiscal Q4. We've seen them rise further into October, so we do believe that we are seeing the peak of lumber cost. However, other costs are increasing as well, we're seeing costs really increasing across-the-board so even when we see perhaps have some relief from lumber as we move further into fiscal 2022, I think that will be offset by other cost increases. As far as the net effect on gross margin, ultimately that will depend on the strength of the demand environment as we move into the spring season, and our ability to continue to offset costs with prices. Right now, our short-term view is that we should be able to offset cost with price and maintain our margins that are around the level that we just reported in the fourth quarter. But, truly as we move through fiscal 2022, it will depend on the strength of the demand environment.",0.7000433,0.927
DHI-2021-Q4-2021-11-09,51,Answer,2021-11-09,4,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"And our ability to continue to achieve affordability is really across a multitude of things. It's not any one thing we would point to. Clearly, our sides and our scale and the construction efficiencies that we've been very focused on, particularly in our Express Homes brand, limiting floor plans, limiting options, being able to control the trades at our job site all-day long, house to house to house, repetitively doing the same thing over and over and over again, has been a benefit in that regard. And then to a lesser extent, we have also continued to see our average square footage come down, and that's the way we can focus on affordability as well, is building more of our smaller floor plans.",0.6071566,0.224

And assuming it's not a weakening of demand, I just wanted to go back to what you said in March. I think Jessica, that they get you a stress test that your backlog.

Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"That last question, yes, we did update the stress test and we look at that every quarter in our backlog and found no real change. In fact, to maybe a slight improvement from the March quarter to what we saw in September quarter backlog. In the sales restrictions, it's certainly a function of supply. We're seeing that we have been able to pull more homes to the production process to points, where we are able to give that buyer a more confident delivery date and give them a better experience in the process. I don't think that in anyway, it's sales that have been reflective of the demand environment.",0.3055672,-0.22

So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes. And that's scattered across the country, so it's not like we're seeing any pile up of available inventory.

Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results here in a pretty tough environment. So on the order outlook, Bill, you spoke to the Q1 uptick and I think suggesting basically 28% higher sequentially versus Q4, which is certainly well above historical norms, and not surprising as you released those sales restrictions and the inventory homes are there. Does this atypical uptick get you back to equilibrium for lack of a better term? Or should we understand that just given your inventory position ahead of the spring that we can perhaps see yet another, I guess I'd call it unusual uptick as you kind of released those sales and continue to lessen the sales restrictions.

The prior-year trends really don't apply to where we are today. Our sales order pace and the sequential pace of our shareholders is really driven by supply, by the homes that we have started, that we have in production that reached the stage that were ready to release them for sales, and so our sales volumes are really governed by or constrained by our homes in inventory where they stand. And so right now, with the visibility that we have to Q1, we believe we're in position where we will deliver sales that are equal to or maybe, slightly better than last year's level, which is an unusual sequential pattern versus where we were in Q4 when we were restricting sales. And then as we move into the year, I think the pattern will still be governed by our inventory levels.",0.6977815,0.71

First question, I was hoping to get a little bit of sense of how you're thinking about gross margins? At least perhaps directionally through fiscal '22 and even longer term. Understanding, obviously, a lot is in flux. But as you look through the rest of the year, obviously a lot of people are focusing on the reduction of lumber cost, as a tailwind. At the same time, you have some other headwinds in terms of additional cost inflation and I guess, assuming incentives and discounts are steady, just trying to get a sense of how you think at this point between lumber and other areas of cost inflation in the current pricing that you have in place, how things might progress throughout the rest of '22.",1.017772,0.201
DHI-2021-Q4-2021-11-09,71,Answer,2021-11-09,4,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"We really don't have much visibility to our gross margin past a quarter or two, so you heard our specific gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, which was essentially relatively in line with Q4. As Bill mentioned, continued lumber headwinds in that December quarter. Some of that does back off as we move throughout next year. But ultimately, the gross margin that we achieved for fiscal 2022 as a whole is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season, which we're pretty far out on. But I think we do feel with the strength in today's market, we should be in a very good position to continue to hopefully at least maintain gross margins from here. But we'll update as necessary as we move throughout the year and see how the spring unfolds and some of these supply chain pressures that are continuing to drive some cost increases.",0.3142609,0.676
DHI-2021-Q4-2021-11-09,72,Question,2021-11-09,4,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Right. Appreciate that. I guess also just longer term. You're in a new state of play here in terms of plus or minus around 27%. Just 3 years ago you were at closer to 20% and versus the last cycle. I think your peak was around 25.5% in 2005. Over the next 2, 3, or 4 years, as your underwriting deals today, and just curious, obviously, you underwrite them for returns, but there was a gross margin component in that. How should we think about a quote unquote normal or even a new normal? Again, assuming that we don't have this over the next 12 to 18 months, like a complete mean reversion to a let's say, a fuller incentive pipe backdrop or whatnot.",0.4558393,0.941
DHI-2021-Q4-2021-11-09,73,Answer,2021-11-09,4,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Appreciate that, and it's a great point. One, we do focus first and foremost on returns and not just the margin. You're right, it is a component of the return equation. And three years ago, as you mentioned we were around 20% and if we had said at the time, we think three years from now, we will be at 27%. I don't think we'd have gotten a lot of credibility for that prediction. So it's really hard, as Jeff mentioned before, to really give us any great degree of confidence in predicting accurately what margins will be several periods out. I do think in our forward underwriting, is that we are encouraged by what we see and what we'll be able to achieve in margins going forward.

They're not enough to keep us at 27%, but two things we would point to, that we believe we can maintain are the scale advantages. There would expect to maintain some level of improvement in our margin from that. But then also less interest in our cost of sales.

The M&A landscape is pretty similar to where it's been the past few quarters. It's anecdotal. We're not looking for any major transformational M&A opportunities. It would be hard for us to accomplish one of those at the scale we're at today.

We were asking gas to get employees and really became less and less comfortable with that, I think on the last call I might have statement about infrastructure, and then immediately had a quick talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles, and then doubling our reach account. So that we're continuing to scale up our platform, to make -- to coincide with the scale-up in market share that we're gaining. We've got great people that are performed at exceptional levels.

And it's a training process. And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently, and to be in new markets more consistently. As he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions, we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles, and it's just kind of a consistent stairstep where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you're forced to make a change.",0.1885341,0.972

I'd love to drill in a little bit on the rental operations, obviously breaking it out this quarter, and certainly, I think over $700 million of revenue -- clearly got some aggressive growth plans there. So focusing first on the single-family rental side, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the rollout there and maybe what you've been surprised on or maybe what's reaffirmed your views up to this point as you start leasing up communities and selling them? Are you seeing any interesting trends on who these renters are? Are they longer-term renters that are choosing to rent? Are they people waiting for a new home to be built? Any kind of either anecdotal or data you can provide there? And longer term, how big of a piece of the business do you want to target this at?",0.3551366,0.353

People moving into areas, they're looking for housing, they're looking for a better lifestyle. Things that probably have surprised us, level of demand and the lack of, not only from a rental standpoint, but from what I consider institutional type investor base that has bought the three that we saw.

You mentioned the institutional capital, a lot of your peers have either partnered up with some of those investors and established joint ventures or some ongoing investment there.

We wouldn't necessarily expect to continue to generate the same margin that we've shown on these first few, but do expect pretax profit margins to be higher on the rental business than on our for-sale business and to generate an accretive return, it needs to be a little bit higher, because of the assets are held a little bit longer.

But then, very early in the year as we saw softer market in the first quarter, we lowered our revenue expectations.

And our mortgage company though has also done a fantastic job working on becoming more efficient, they've improved their capture rate. I think, 63% this quarter was one of the highest we've seen in quite some time. But, normal historical operating margin is more in the 30% range, the low 30s.

I was wondering if -- there shouldn't be any lingering impact from that. Let's say, if your stock price would remain flat into next year, should there -- the reason I'm asking is because 1Q guide on SG&A is for flat, even though your closings are up about 7%, just kind of like what you're thinking for the year.

Yes, the change in the accrual should not have any lingering effect that you are correct in that assumption. As we look at our absolute level of SG&A spend going into the first quarter along with our revenue guide, we believe 9.5% is the level that we feel like we will be at. If you do go back a year ago though if you're comparing year-over-year, in the first quarter, we had some, I hate to say benefit, but we did have some benefit from a reduction in our stock price last year. So, some of those accruals were pulled down a year ago in the first quarter. So, it's simply timing on that basis, but it does move the needle a bit.

I can tell you we're not thinking that we're going to see a margin expansion because I do believe there is going to be more competition.

Now, those can move the needle quarter-to-quarter but they are really hard to project. So, right now, they are approximately 21%, would assume those are relatively in the same range as they were in Q4. And then, we're able to maintain a flat pricing environment or a pricing environment that is increased at the same level as our cost. So, that's what we saw this quarter sequentially -- well, actually sequentially we saw an improvement because of the continued pullback on incentives, which we think we're through the most of.

So, without those acquisitions, we've been trending in that pretty low single digit range, only 1% or 2% on a year-over-year basis.

Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Megan, we saw the buyers -- every time that affordability is constrained, the buyers have to readjust and there is certainly a pause in the marketplace. And interest rates are big driver of affordability. At the same time that as Jessica mentioned earlier, that gave us the real focus to get back into our product and think about what we are offering and try to bring housing prices down for our customers at a way that provides -- still provided a good margin for the Company, and we did that. And we'll continue to adjust to the marketplace for whatever the interest rate environment gives us. I do think one of the things that we are seeing is that there's continued job growth in the economy and there's some continued wage growth. And that's very helpful for households. And that large population, that large demographic is aging one year further down, and they're having life events that often drive them to prefer single family housing as their housing choice.

So, what we're saying in that guide is that we don't have the same level to pull back on incentives as we did this year. We will pretty much have cycled through the higher incentives that we had to institute last year at this time to drive a sales pace. So, we continue to have some limited cost pressures on the labor front that's consistently been somewhat of a headwind. But, we've worked to offset it in other categories. And generally, now that we've offset, cycled the higher lumber costs, our material costs are net neutral. Our purchasing team's doing a great job of when we do have a category that the cost is going up, they find a category where we can look to offset it.

Definitely, labor is getting tighter and continues to -- I think going to restrict a lot of people's ability to deliver houses. Again, it goes back to the kind of operating profile we adopted and continue, and that is consistent starts throughout the community, expanding the labor base, the efficiency, not necessarily just bodies. And we feel very good about what we've accomplished. We have a very loyal trade base. I think I said on the last call, our traders don't have to go chase their paychecks.

We're still on track with our plan there John to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar. We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September, which diluted our position down from the original 75%; here in December, we're sitting at 65%. We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position. And then, as we've also said all along, there's a potential that we could sell some of our shares. And at the point in time that we are ready to do that, we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance. And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position.",0.253244,0.891

And then frankly, as usual this time of the year, the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4. Early returns in the spring selling season have been very positive. So, we're confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins in the Q2, but we're going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks.",0.2901116,0.658

One, the comparison to prior year, we're actually down 5%. We've changed the way we report homes and inventory to exclude the model homes. So, last year, we were -- where we were last year, like 31,800; and so, this year, we are at 30,200. So, we're down slightly from last year. And last year may have been a bit elevated with softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of '18. Another thing we've talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars. And then, we're also seeing the ability to push starts in as we're seeing demand come on. We're not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be built versus our spec starts, continuing probably an 80-20 consistent approach for that.",1.3051174,0.681
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,47,Question,2020-01-27,1,2020,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"First question I had for you is on the land spend. The land spend was fairly high relative to our expectations this quarter. I'm talking specifically on the acquisition number of 890. [Ph] And as a percentage of rev, that was probably the highest we've seen in six years. And, given your discipline and given your outlook on the business and your intention to basically get a return on that spend within 24 months, it seems that there's a fair amount of optimism that's implied by that strong land spend. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that, maybe break that down for us, at least qualitatively, in terms of was that kind of a strong land spend fairly equally distributed across the country where there are certain opportunities that emerged in a particular region or a particular product type that garnered a lion share of that? If you could just talk about the relatively strong land spend in greater detail?",0.1748087,0.974
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,48,Answer,2020-01-27,1,2020,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Stephen. As you know, you start your land spend, there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter-to-quarter. And so, one quarter, just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and based on our business plans, there can be a bit of lumpiness there. One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is for finished lots. And so, we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finished lots which turn very quickly. And so I would really just attribute -- I wouldn't say there is necessarily any changes in our plans, but I would attribute a bit of this to a bit of a lumpiness, point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend. But, then we do -- we are optimistic. We do see growth, certainty in fiscal '20. And right now, we still see very good underlying fundamentals for the business. And so, we are still actively replenishing our land and lot supply.",1.0678108,0.955

DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,50,Question,2020-01-27,1,2020,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"Great. Yes. That's helpful. Second question relates to the broader macro environment or rather the broader environment with respect to housing policy. We've seen some interesting moves here as of late. We have seen the average DTIs, the high DTIs and high LTV lending be curtailed or reined back the FHFA. And yes, we've also heard that CFPD weigh in here and suggest they're going to move to an APOR spread versus the DTI. I was curious as to whether or not you have looked into this. Some of what we've heard is that the move to the APOR spread would actually be stimulative to entry-level housing, on top of the dropping rates. That would seem to be extremely favorable for your business. And I was curious if you had looked at that at all. And if you have any view on whether or not these broader factors may be positive for your business the way it would appear to us?",0.5703355,0.983

That being said, it's super early and out there and it's not something that we spend a lot of time on. I'm sure our mortgage company would have a much more detailed response for you. But anything that continues to improve mortgage standards and makes it easier for people to get into a house clearly would be a benefit for our business. That being said, as David mentioned in his opening, financing availability is still good. I mean people that should be buying houses are who are buying houses today.

Internally, we talk about goals, but that's an internal conversation. And it's kind of a balanced program. I think, the Forestar platform is again built out.

And for the last, I don't know, ever since the downturn, we've had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities. And so, our trade base has gotten better at building the houses. And when they're not out there chasing work, then they can build more houses. What I look at is the same labor. We build more square footage with the same labor hours. So, it's a process. It's something we've worked on all the way through this cycle. I think early on, we felt like labor was going to be the constraint on housing. And we have done I think a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money. And we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost.",0.4328588,0.896
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,65,Answer,2020-01-27,1,2020,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Matt, the other thing we look at here and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing in our process when we start a house, can we get it completed and then closed. And we're not seeing those times elongate, which would be real, more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets. So, the longstanding deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers, combined with a more efficient plan set, if you will, in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability, has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better, and we're going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year.",0.1264127,0.856
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,67,Question,2020-01-27,1,2020,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"First question I had was on your outlook for the year for community count and sales pace. I believe last quarter you talked about, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you'd expect community count -- average community count for the year to be up year-over-year, low single digits. I was wondering if that's still the expectation. I believe it's been flat sequentially more or less for last few quarters, but I guess the expectation would be to drift upward a little bit. And then, also on the sales pace, you had a nice improvement year-over-year. And I was just curious, if that was more driven by market conditions or certain product or geographic mix shifts, and how you think about the next quarter or two?",0.723676,0.863
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,68,Answer,2020-01-27,1,2020,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Sure. So, when we think about community count, Mike, it's the hardest one for us to predict, quite honestly, which is why we never give formal guidance on it. I think, our base case would be that we would anticipate it to tick up at some point, as we move throughout the year. But when that inflection point actually happens, it's hard to call exactly. In terms of the sales pace, as we mentioned in the script, that does reflect the moderation in demand we saw in late calendar 2018. So, we did have -- although we generally don't talk about comps, we did have a relatively easy comp, when you look at that. And what our guidance reflects for the year from a closings perspective would infer that our sales year-over-year increase is going to moderate from Q1 and it will fluctuate Q2, Q3, Q4 in a range that supports that closings growth guidance that we've alluded to.",0.242306,0.918
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,69,Question,2020-01-27,1,2020,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"I guess, secondly, bigger picture, kind of maybe piggybacking off an earlier question of owned versus option. Maybe said a different way, your lot option percentage has obviously while huge amounts of progress, impressive progress over the last few years, now, it's kind of been in that low-60s type of range, 60 to 61, 62, maybe over the last 3, 4 quarters. That increase over the last few years has been a big, big driver of your improved return profile. Just trying to get a sense of over the next 2 or 3 years, certainly, you're not going to do the same type of degree of change on the lot option profile, as you have before, maybe you'll drift up a little bit. I do recall you guys talking about a 70% number perhaps, but maybe now that's not as concrete. But, how should we think about, over the next two or three years, the next big lever of improvement in returns? Would it be more from a share repurchasing standpoint or are other levers that perhaps we're not thinking about?",0.0859813,0.95
DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,70,Answer,2020-01-27,1,2020,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"We expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all for us. We do expect to continue to -- and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward. We're not going to set necessarily an upward target. But, we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows, build out its platform even further, that's going to continue to be part of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers. We've already alluded to on this call we're expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year. And so, that's going to be an incremental level in terms of returns this year. And then, as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side. And so, over the last several years, we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payoffs to shareholders, which has enhanced our ROE. And so, as we continue to incrementally improve each year, I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders.",0.0410213,0.973

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"On the first part, Ken, I would say, it's pretty much in line with what we would expect, especially with the number of completed specs that we have. That allows us the opportunity to sell and close more homes within the quarter. So, I would expect that trend to continue. Last year, in the second quarter, we actually sold and closed 45% homes in the same quarter, sold and closed. If you look at the margin differential, that stayed relatively consistent and that there is a slight differential and a slightly lower margin on specs than there is build jobs. That being said, really the only big differential is on our completed specs that have been completed and unsold for a period of multiple months. So, the earlier we sell it as a spec, the tighter that differential is. And as a reminder, about 80% of what we closed in a quarter started as spec.

Our average time in backlog for a customer that's in a build job is not terribly long because our homes -- generally, we are building through affordable price point, homes build fairly efficiently. And so, the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process, lengthy permitting process till we get to start. A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract. So, it's a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to the marketplace.",0.6048556,0.814

DHI-2020-Q1-2020-01-27,90,Answer,2020-01-27,1,2020,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"No. I don't think so. We're responding to market out there. And certainly, the solar mandate is going to increase cost. But, pulling a permit and building a house when there is not a market forward is going to create a whole lot less return than pay any additional cost. So, it's kind of business as usual for us out there. And the solar mandate was -- we've known about that for several years that we've had the ability to prepare, and that's in our underwriting and we knew those costs were coming and as more and more homes are being built with solar, our base case expectation is that those costs will come down.",0.1011928,0.697

In terms of timing, we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020. We closed our first one here in Q1. We did say that one of our communities is substantially complete, and so the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it. So, we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020, don't have a specific quarter guide for you on that. And then, we do expect the investment level in the DHI Communities to grow this year. We expect it to grow approximately 100% from the point at the start of the year over the course of this year, as their pipeline is growing, and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020, which will ultimately result in some future years, delivering more than two a year.

I'd say labor has stayed in the low single digit percentage range. Now that we've kind of cycled through the lumber headwinds that we had, materials, we essentially would expect to be net neutral. We always have some categories where costs are going up. But, our purchasing teams do a fantastic job of finding other categories to lower our costs and offset whatever increases we're not able to push back on. And then, land really has been kind of a low to mid single digit percentage increase, at least on a per square foot basis. And that really is not expected to change either. I mean, land costs aren't coming down. As home prices, land costs typically follow. So, really just more of the same in '20 as what we experienced in '19, if you take out late calendar '18 incentive environment and the lumber costs that we cycled through.",0.0541829,0.459

So, I would say we have some cushion to work with in that. But again, we're not just looking at a margin number, it is a return numbers, as you alluded to before, the pace versus price. And so, driving the communities at the planned absorptions, we found drive the highest returns. And then, the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activity, seeing momentum, drives generally some pricing power and some margin expansion, executing at the community level. And that's really where our focus is. And as it's rolling up, we've seen pretty consistent margins the last couple quarters and we're looking at that into next quarter. We're optimistic about spring, and that's going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year.",0.5362076,0.84

So, I would say that is incorporated in what we're expecting for fiscal '20, but that's really just been more of the same of what we've experienced each of the last few years. Multiple product types and larger communities allows us to drive more absorption. So, I don't have our current average lot size or a lot count. Rough, I would say probably 150, 200 lots.

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"So, Alex, not to be repetitive, but really, it is a function of where we sit today, the number of houses we have, the number of houses we had going into the year. We did have a much easier comp this quarter compared to late calendar last year, when the market was completely different than what it is. And to remind everyone, we heavily incentivized into December and really ended the spring to continue those sales increases that we saw. I think, we were the only builder in calendar 4Q of '18 that had an up quarter. Our sales were up about 3%, and that really was just a function of how heavily we incentivized in December to get there. So, October and November, you can read into were very tough months. And that led into a good comp this year, and 19% you though. I mean, it's a good market. As Mike's alluded to several times, we feel very good about the market today. But, we sit here today, we haven't seen the spring selling season. We've got 5% fewer houses in the ground. So, if we're able to push and get a few more starts in, and the spring is stronger than expected, could there be a little upside, potentially, but we don't see a whole lot.

If we've got another community replacing a community ready to go behind it, we're going to most likely push more pace than we are priced because that's the best thing that we can do is continue to turn our inventory, generate more revenue and profits in a shorter period of time.

And just a follow on there with Alan's question on the full year profitability projection, in the past you have talked a lot about how you kind of run your business with a 20% to 22% kind of gross margin range. I am gathering from your commentary that much like the topline, historical range 10% to 15% growth isn't necessarily the dominating factor in the way you are running your business right now, but rather returns. That similarly on the gross margin side, we could see this year be a little bit below your 20% historical range and that wouldn't be inconsistent with how you are positioning yourself for the longer-term in a difficult market. I just want to make sure that I am hearing you correctly. And then, could you with respect to margins talk about the degree to which mix may be impacting your margin. Is it -- in other words, is Express still generating gross margins comparable to the company average or maybe a little better or just give us some sense about mix in terms of your margin makeup right now?",0.3175397,0.099

And then with respect to M&A, I think, you talked about maintaining a balance and disciplined approach. Recently we have seen a couple of what I would basically call asset purchases in local markets, Pulte just announced the American West and then Lennar, we understand bought level homes in Raleigh. And so, I guess, I am wondering, do you see the competition for local deals meet midsize sort of private names in local markets. Do you see that competition intensifying in the current environment, and if not, or I should say in a situation where that is actually happening, can you talk about how D.R. Horton is positioned or prepared to approach those kinds of opportunities.

DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,108,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"It certainly is as a component of the overall acquisition, but the determining factor for us is generally going to be the people and the talent rather than simply the lot position or the lot portfolio.

First question I had was just kind of the pace that you have seen over the last two months or three months, perhaps, relative to your expectations, so far as some of the other builders have reported, they have pointed to not just seasonal improvement, but a little bit of improved year-over-year trends. In other words, the year-over-year growth improving as well from January to February and to March, maybe not every month, but certainly towards the end of the quarter, and perhaps even into April. So I was curious if you could give us a sense if that year-over-year growth accelerated as well particularly on a sales pace basis. And when you talk to similarly incentives improving sequentially, obviously, they are still up year-over-year, I was wondering if that year-over-year delta on incentives perhaps has moderated as well.",0.6464174,0.99

DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,114,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"So we have got communities where we have been able to roll those back fully from what we have had to do in the fall and we have got some that still have some elevated incentives out there. But as we continue to move throughout the spring, we are hopeful that we can continue to dial those back in communities, where maybe we haven't been able to fully yet.",1.935414,0.681
DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,115,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,I would say we are not seeing anything outside of normal seasonality. It's been a good spring. It's been a solid spring. But we would say it's consistent with what we would expect to see in normal seasonality thus far.,1.770681,0.542
DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,116,Question,2019-04-25,2,2019,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay. So unless I am interpreting that differently, it seems like perhaps again on a year-over-year trend basis, again, I know you kind of punted on the month-to-month, but it does, it sounds like normal seasonality means that, again, unless I am reading the tea leaves of your answer a little too finally that, perhaps, it was more steady it sounds like rather than improvement. I guess, second question maybe just to zone in on a region here. Appreciate the color commentary on Texas. Another big focal point has been California, and in particular, some of the real improvements month-to-month over the last two months or three months, 4Q was pretty rough. Just wanted to get a sense again if there's been anything outside of normal seasonality or would you say that by contract anything a little bit more from an acceleration standpoint?",0.7392523,0.941

DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,133,Question,2019-04-25,2,2019,Ken Zener,Keybanc,"So let me ask you this question. If you look at your units in inventory, it appears that your conversion rate of closing is decelerating versus kind of the past, which would imply and that's been happening in recent quarters, so it's one of two things, obviously, there's fair demand or your inventory on average is just a little bit younger. Is it because your -- why is that, is it because you are building more specs and you just tend to have more younger inventory versus something that was more backlog-ish and what exactly was the intra-quarter order of closings, please?",0.8885017,0.202

Looking at the age of our inventory, the number of unsold homes that we have in inventory completed over six months was the same at March 31, 2019 as it was at March 31, 2018.

DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,138,Question,2019-04-25,2,2019,Ken Zener,Keybanc,"Yeah. How -- okay. Let me look at this another way. I mean, obviously, you guys are issuing guidance, because the last six months are pretty much already growing vertical. How do you think about your spec position as it relates to backlog? So, obviously, you want to achieve even flow, which you do that by reducing your December quarter units in inventory as much as you did historically and others do which helps you with market share. But how do you think about how you are running spec versus what you are seeing in terms of orders. I mean, you always going to keep basically your units under construction at a 2:1 ratio backlog? Is that your approach in general or how should we think about how that spec will turn relative to the lower industry growth rate that we are seeing?",0.4968641,0.923
DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,139,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Generally, we look at a snapshot of inventory position of around 50% of sold to unsold homes in total inventory that will vary higher and lower at different points in the year. But -- and that's sort of a result of every one of our operating divisions evaluating their communities one by one, looking at a trailing sales pace along with an expected forward sales pace based upon where they are in the year and what they are seeing in those sub-markets.",0.2235245,-0.296
DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,140,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then they are adjusting their spec inventory kind of relative to the construction cycle of that community and managing it week-to-week-to-week based on sales, closing and production completions.

DHI-2019-Q2-2019-04-25,147,Answer,2019-04-25,2,2019,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Sure. So, Matthew, we saw actually 20 basis points of impact in our March quarter. Honestly, probably a little bit lighter than we would have expected. We did û not that we like to talk about weather, but some of our acquisitions are in markets that do experience a little bit more extreme weather than a lot of the markets we already operated in. So a little bit of that purchase accounting impact has been delayed really until this quarter, Q3 and into Q4.

Now that part of your business seems to be maturing, just wondering if you could give us some kind of broad brush strokes on how you expect that to grow, how big a part of the business it can become, what regions of the country you might ultimately expect it to be and then whether it would kind of stick to the garden style apartments or whether it might broaden in terms of product lines.

So coming back to the annual guidance, I know there's been a lot of questions about it and it's been a very difficult environment over the past six months to nine months to even think about what '19 might have looked like. Investors generally looking at the market, rates have fallen, the outlook for the year, obviously, from what builders have been saying has improved. And so just wanted to dig into how are you reflecting that in your guidance that you have given? I mean, if you look at the volume guidance, for example, acquisitions are a big part of it and gross margins you are expecting some modest improvement. So -- and of course we appreciate your more kind of level approach to giving guidance through these periods of volatility, but how should we think about how your guidance is reflecting improvement in demand that the market has seen in recent months, should we think about their potentially being more upside against your guidance or it's a de-risk to guidance or how should we think about that?",0.1221429,0.803

We're seeing some pricing power in the communities where we have achieved the absorption pace, where going to rode these communities too and so that's been very helpful in maintaining our gross margin. At the same time, with our cost structure going forward we're seeing an efficient building process yield in savings in our vertical construction cost and so we've been able to offset some of the lot cost increases we've been seeing some through to protect the margins. Looking forward with regard to our cost structure, our guys are working very hard every day, we're working very hard with our national supplier partners to protect that cost structure. I can't say we're doing anything radically different on buying lumber it's something we look at market-by-market looking at the commodity market and trying to lock-in pricing when we feel it's a good time again market-by-market in lumber.",0.0569276,0.917

Year-over-year we saw revenue per square foot up 3% and our stick and brick costs were only were up 1%, what was offsetting that we do continue to see slightly higher land prices falling through our P&L on a per square foot basis and sequentially our revenues per square foot in our stick and brick was really right in line, they were both just very low single-digit percentage.",0.2817512,-0.458

We've talked about it, we have visibility to exactly where the community count is pretty good for our quarter too but beyond that it gets a little murky just given the timing of when communities roll off. So as we look the next couple of quarters, we continue to believe we're going to stay relatively stable plus or minus flat within couple of percentage points. But we do believe that over the long-term as we get into '18 and beyond as we continue to expect to grow at a 10% to 15% pace on the top line that will require some community count growth and so as we make those investments to prepare for that growth, we would expect, so we get into '18 for our community counts to start to rise at a modest pace. We still expect to continue to improve our absorptions and are very focused community-by-community on executing as well as we can to continue to drive some of our growth through absorption improvement as well.",0.6253544,0.986

The concept of Freedom is to capture an expand the offering to include the people that just don't want to live next door to a two-storey with bunch of kids and those buyers are out there. We're trying to set these communities up as kind of lock and leave opportunity something that they don't have to be there every day to maintain and that was a buyer segment that to be honest with you, we were not actively pursuing at the level, we are now but we think it's a huge opportunity for the company and little more difficult to roll out in Express because it a specific type of community that we're launching Freedom, you can't just go build it on a lot.

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Just as we look it's very early when we look at average price points on Freedom versus Express today, they're running about 10% to 15% higher, so there is a little bit of extra cost for those home buyers, so they're still affordable but certainly a step above Express and there is an element of HO8B to cover the maintenance and those [indiscernible] for the community that are not in Express as well, so little bit of differentiation from an economic standpoint.",0.3074119,0.81

I'll tag onto to the rest of the question and in terms of our overall allocations acquisitions are part of that, but we're going to remain disciplined and so we're going to, we certainly have the room to make large investment there, if we find the right deal that fits out return strategy. In terms of share repurchase, we have an outstanding authorization from our board of $100 million which we have not used as of yet and when we talk about our top priorities our most significant priorities for this year, we'd laid those out but that is something and we've talked about this previously that as we look further and as we generate cash flow for our third consecutive year over the longer term, we would expect there to be some level of share repurchase in our overall allocation, but as of yet we have not purchased any shares back.",0.4645606,0.949

Current pace puts you at about 46,000, 47,000 orders for fiscal 2017. How much upside is there as you think about getting all over communities to their optimal absorption rate? I mean does that take us to 55,000, 60,000 on the current footprint and I understand you mentioned community counts might begin to rise again in 2018, just trying to think about how much upside there is left on this absorption push?",0.0489286,0.897

If you'd asked us three years ago if we'd be exactly where we're today I'm not sure what our answer would have because we're just trying to get better every day and what I'd tell you is that, our operators through the field and our division Presidents who are out there working hard every day, they're finding ways to get better every day and so we do believe there is continued upside, there is continued opportunities to continue to get better, we got certain markets, that so they can significantly better. We've got others that maybe getting closer to that potential, we're going to keep trying to work to improve it and we do believe that, in this year and into next year we will continue to find ways to improve our absorptions.

DHI-2017-Q2-2017-04-20,63,Question,2017-04-20,2,2017,Ken Zener,Keybanc,"Yes, so looking at from operational metrics your orders were basically seasonal in 2Q that's quarter-over-quarter pace. You guys did very well in 1Q, so it's good you maintained that. But when I think about your guidance which is related to closing, I think about comms that are totally about which includes all your specs, so you used under construction. Your guidance went from I think 8% to 13%, it's like 10% to 14% for year-over-year now and little bit. But your units under construction was 14% growth in 1Q, now we're down to 10%. Can you talk about the decisions that are being made to have that lower growth, was it warmer weather that it enabled you to put more units in the ground and you're really targeting 10% because the delta shows that you're decelerating your units under construction, which obviously build up in the year closing. So can you kind of talk about that actual capital allocation if we use units under construction, year-over-year as the indicator for your forward, best speedometer.",0.9533101,0.959

We've talked quite a bit about the fact that we were starting this year much stronger in position back on October 1 and then January 1 with our units under construction to prepare ourselves for the spring and so we had a stronger a year-over-year comparison in those first couple of quarters, I wouldn't say that we're decelerating at all and order versus our expectations there, we just simply got an earlier start and so now we're into a good mode of just replacing homes and maintaining on that level, that we believe will support the growth that we're expecting and position to start to position ourselves then for next year as well, so wouldn't read too much into just this quarter and positioning on a year-over-year, we're in a good position with our homes under construction.",0.7658971,0.957

As you start moving into right from 2Q, to 3Q, to 4Q. 4Q is actually just multiply it every times two and it's usually your forward volumes. So I'm just trying to think about not only the execution that you're doing this year but how you're setting up conceptually 18 right from your capital allocation, as we think about that and it seems as though. Labor is not an issue here, closing is a percent of units under construction is exactly what it was last year, you obviously labor is not an issue for you so, just determining how many units you are going to have in for spec so.",1.2320557,-0.753

In general, we're hearing that there is strength across the board but probably more concentrated at the lower end, lower price points and I was curious if you could give us a sense for, if your strategy or the pace of implementation of price increases varies or is different when the strength you see is more in those lower price communities.",0.0011772,0.09
DHI-2017-Q2-2017-04-20,83,Answer,2017-04-20,2,2017,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Stephen, we try to be consistent in our operation and absorption in these communities. So based upon the season and timing within the year, but the best practice we found is small, incremental based on number of units that are being sold, so if it's a 300-lot community and we want to sell 10 a month, then we would have a nominal increase every 10 houses, so if there is a consistency to the pricing, there is a set urgency to get people off fence, and they buy now or they pay little more next month. So and that's proven to be very effective, it's not only creates urgency but it improves margin.",0.1027318,0.953

And then the second question I had to relates to kind of more general question, I think one of the things that we're seeing that's really fascinating about the industry and the stocks right now is, this sort of blend between things that are early cycle and later cycle, the valuations that we're seeing in the group, level of margins, the labor constraints you're running into and first rate of land spend as a percentage of revenue those are all things to more characteristic of later cycle and yet, we - I should say the not the multiple the evaluations are actually more early cycle. But we're also seeing that growing share at the entry level and the overall level at housings are to very cycles. So you have some aspects to the market that are kind of early cyclish and then you have some aspects it seems like they're more later cyclish . And I'm curious as to, as you look it where we are right now and you try to assess your strategy over the course of the next few years let's say, where do you think we are in the housing cycle and which of these various metrics or things to look at, do you think are the best gage for determining where we are and what the right approach for your company should be from a cyclical perspective.",0.1286051,0.966

It doesn't get a sense that it's an actuary or something like there will be some disruptions and things may change. But right now in the markets that are producing at the top for us, there is more demand and less options or inventory out there than any forward that I have been in this business, so and I think you get too focused, I think sometimes we can get too focused on trying to judge a cycle and miss tremendous opportunity.",0.2116199,0.904

I think coming out of the last downturn we saw more of the move up buyers pent up demand being satisfied in that rush and now I think we're seeing more the entry level first-time buyers coming into the marketplace now that there is some supply out there, that is attainable for those folks.

And I traveled Texas, Louisiana and Arizona in the last couple of months and I can tell you, I think I said two or three years ago Dallas was the best housing market I've ever seen, still an incredibly strong market, but [indiscernible] strengthened Houston an opportunity and Houston that compressed oil industry, kind of put on hold. Austin is red hot. Phoenix is - we're opening a price point Phoenix didn't exist.

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Well John, I think one element here is, if we're looking at simply year-over-year trend one part of that component is the prior year numbers. We had a slow start last year honestly and we've talked about that, we were trying to play catch up all year long with our homes and inventory and getting communities open and we got lot of our growth last year in achieving our 10% to 15% of the growth in the second half of the year, we worked really hard to position ourselves to start this year a better position and so when we performed in Q1 and Q2 versus a slower Q1 and Q2 last year, we've seen a higher annual growth rate. The year is still right in line with what we've expected, it's not a deceleration of growth. It's really more of function of the comparison to the prior year on a quarter-to-quarter basis.",0.2093965,0.953

My second question is going back to actually I think the first question around lumber and I appreciate that you guys have the purchasing power to negotiate much better deals than some other across the industry, but just want to make sure we understand just mechanically the right way to think about it between how you contract out on lumber and then the cost allocation process that takes place as you incur potentially higher cost and then obviously your build cycle. So could you extend this most recent leg higher in lumber sticks, is that something that will impact the P&L in the second half or is it more likely to be something where you'd have it impacting fiscal '18.",0.2756184,0.862
DHI-2017-Q2-2017-04-20,114,Answer,2017-04-20,2,2017,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Mike, so we would allocate the cost to the individual houses that we're buying the lumber for and we're looking out lumber pricing, it varies on the lot 30, 60, 90 days and some adjustments so that, so the buying, protecting our backlog and our plan spec starts in the near term. So as any lumber cost may come through in our purchasing production they would show up in a house closing four to six months after that lumber was dropped on the lot, or two to six months after that lumber was dropped on the lot and so you would see that particular cost line potentially having some pressure, but I would tell you that we would expect to see some of those things offset by other decreases and other material costs that we're seeing as well as continued greater labor efficiencies that we're getting with our production processes in our neighbourhoods, more with the Express and some of that Express concepts going into our other product lines.",0.3051486,0.827

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Sequentially our community count on average was up 2%, so it was the first time we've seen a slight tick up in that community count and we do have the lot for that to happen but as Bill mentioned earlier the timing of when communities roll off and when new ones roll on, it's pretty flexible and it's highly dependent on the sales absorptions we're seeing in our currently open communities and then also just our ability to bring new communities online because there is a lot of moving part. So we could see that continue to go up, but we don't expect it to go drastically up, any changes in our community count both sequentially and year-over-year we would expect to be in the low single-digit range.",0.7503251,0.788
DHI-2017-Q2-2017-04-20,122,Question,2017-04-20,2,2017,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay, fair enough. Also on the gross margin front, obviously still well within your guidance range, but essentially what you've had now couple of quarters a touch below 20%, that was proceeded by the back half to '16 a little bit above 20%, so just curious if there is anything mixed driven so far in the first half of this year that you know resulted in it being a little touch below, it seems like your cost inflation is still very reasonable and not too much of a driver, if I'm interpreting those numbers correctly. So just curiously, if it was little bit more mix driven or you know obviously the warranties sometimes play a role.",1.011215,0.884

We really think, incredible stability actually in our gross margin for quite some time now, at a core level it's been very tight within 20, 30 basis points from quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter and that's why we guide around 20 and we can see some quarterly volatility due to some of those other factors that you mentioned, in general our interest costs have been ticking slightly lower as a percentage of our cost and so that's been a slight help to our margin over the last eight quarters or so. We see more volatility in terms of our warranty line there and in recent quarters we've seen a little bit more of a negative impact from that, not too significant but a little bit more of a negative impact there in the last couple of quarters, which is one factor why we've been slightly below 20%, but overall we would characterize our margins as very stable, we're seeing actually less volatility from all of those factors than we've seen over the longer term history in our company and as long we're continuing to guide to around 20%, but you'll see some movement either above 20% and or below 20% from quarter-to-quarter.",0.0554881,-0.688

Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"That's part of our overall analysis of Freedom, is that we're giving adult children and the parents an opportunity and an affordable opportunity to live near their children and grandchildren. I mean we just feel like that's a major factor and people relocating and I've lived in Florida for 25 years, saw it every day where somebody was moving down. A job had brought the family the children and grandchildren down and then the parents were coming on trying to find something to buy, where they would have the home close to their grandchildren. Just think that's a big driver in the market and as far as the overall cost and the design and what I mean that's a market-to-market determination. What we try to do with the Freedom product is drive as much as efficiency and labor savings as we possibly could. And so everything we're doing today is to drive better value to the customer and try to take labor out of houses where we can because that's going to be, that has been and continuously the constraint on a market right now.

And we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions, and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align our current production levels and our selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers.",1.1181224,0.969

We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and a low leverage positioned us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions.

Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $359,200. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. As David described in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales over pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales paces and prices to market on a community by community basis, while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter. However, we are confident that we will be well positioned to deliver double digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 32,200 homes in backlog, 47,300 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships.

The increase in our gross margin from March to June exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4.7% sequentially, while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 3.5%. And our lot costs increased 1.7%. We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase on a per square foot basis. However, with the strength in today's market conditions; we expect to offset any cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the third quarter.

We expect that by 2020, our cash flow from operations should be in excess of $1 billion. That's our estimate today and our guidance today. But certainly, we have - we do have high expectations for our ability to increase our option portion of our land position, and certainly, Forestar is a part of that as well. And over the next year as we build out Forestar's platform and it begins to contribute a greater impact on our overall operations, I do think we do have a lot of cash flow generation capability that could, potentially, exceed what we're guiding to now for the next couple of years.",0.8840519,0.965

We've actually got a time line included in the presentation that we'll post that will outline kind of over the next year what we're planning on giving you further on Forestar.

Horton, and we expect to keep our owned-lot supply relatively flat, while we grow our option position with other land developers and as Forestar grows their platform as well. So, our land-spend in order to replenish lots and land at D.R. Horton in fiscal 2018 will continue to be at or above the same level that we did this past year.

And as I remind everyone, I think, every quarter, is why we don't give specific guidance regarding community count. But our community count was at 2% year-over-year to finish the year out. It was actually down 1% sequentially. So, as we look and move through fiscal 2018, we really expect it to be flat, no more than slightly up. So, a continued story of absorptions maybe with a little bit of community count growth to drive that 10% to 15% increase in units this year.",0.6163849,0.612

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","I don't have the specific dollars in front of me, Carl, here but the delta on the closing side, we provided revised guidance in mid-September of about 85% backlog conversion. Our operators were able to over deliver on that in late September, and we delivered 87%, so that 2% change in conversion rate would be the delta on the closing side. The remainder would be less spending on inventory, primarily in the land development side, a little bit of land back as well.",0.7748076,0.392

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","As in the - primarily in the areas that were affected by the hurricane, there was - where there was certainly a slowdown and some disruption in activity there. And that was a little bit greater than we anticipated. And so, the remainder of that cash flow delta would come from our land activity. We would have expected our annual land spend and development spend to be a bit higher than it was. And so clearly, that's a timing thing that does slide into 2018. But even with that, we still expect to exceed $500 million of cash flow from operations in 2018.",0.5488052,0.614
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,93,Answer,2017-11-09,4,2017,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Mike, I think, looking at the $400 million we expect Forestar to commit in 2018, not all of that will be spent in 2018. That's the commitment to those projects. As they develop and execute over time, that - some of that will be spent in 2018, some of it in 2019. So, it's not all $400 million is going to go out on the - when you start the project. The other part of it is that Forestar does have a current portfolio of projects, a lot of lots under contracts to builders to sell over the next 12 months that they'll be continuing to deliver lots to those builders, which will bring up more capital to continue developing some of their existing projects, as well as invest in net new projects for the Forestar program. So, we're still working out the exact capital needs Forestar's going to have and expect to get more of that information back to you in 2018.",0.2292426,0.71

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","We're still working with the Forestar guys to figure out exactly what those projections ought to look like. We are optimistic about the numbers we put out in that June deck that we're seeing a greater deal flow that will give us an ability to exceed these numbers. It's hard to sit here today and quantify that exactly, but we are seeing a deal flow that we expect will be greater than what we anticipated for these projections. Doubling, probably a little too aggressive to say that it's going to double at this point, but we're working hard to find every opportunity that makes sense and hits the return hurdles for Forestar.",0.5965978,0.858
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,103,Question,2017-11-09,4,2017,Ken Zener,Keybanc,"So, one of the things that we always talk about is the pace that you talked about your community count. What I'd like to focus on is your units under construction in your 4Q, so your September, and how you've made the choice to not cycle down as much, often as other builders do seasonally, which really gives you just a higher entry point into 2Q. Is there any particular reason - and I think that's what's really different about your business model versus other builders is you do build all this spec. Looking at this year, you're up 13% I believe year-over-year versus last year at 17%, community count seems to be flat in both cases, is there something happening that this year versus last year in terms of construction or your regional mix that's kind of keeping that 26,000 unchanged number at a lower growth rate than you had last year?",0.2641115,-0.389

We're just positioning to grow the company. And I do think that you get to a certain size of the - the positioning has to - takes a bit longer, so we purposefully put more inventory out, started more inventory late in the fourth quarter to be positioned for a, what we think is going to be a very good spring selling market.",0.36591,0.475
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,105,Answer,2017-11-09,4,2017,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","And Ken, two years ago, I think we entered fiscal 2016, probably a little lighter than we would've liked to have been in housing inventory, for the market that we saw in front of us. And so, as we grew our year-over-year, year-end inventory position in 2015 to 2016 pretty aggressively, and we're glad we did because we were able to take advantage of that into 2016. The growth from 2016 to 2017 has moderated a little bit from that prior year growth because we were better positioned to start 2016 - we were better positioned, excuse me, to start 2017 than we were 2016. So that gave us less need to add inventory, but we still feel what units we have on hand right now, 26,300, we feel great about that positioning going into 2018.",0.2377481,0.966

And if I could use that segue to hinge on spring selling, which we approach just seasonally, where over the last few years, your pace, if you look back over the long term, and it appears usually, the pace usually sell at 15% to 18% in the December quarter. But in the last few years, it's been either up or down single-digit, which is a big change and that provides a lot greater pace momentum. Can you talk about what your base outlook is for spring selling; I realize you don't know the exact numbers, but just from the seasonal basis, what do you expect that to be historically?",0.2526132,0.296

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"It goes in line with what we're trying to drive from a closings perspective, which is the only number we actually guide to. But if you look at it, generally speaking, we typically see a very sharp increase from December to March, although September to December's relatively flat, slightly up to slightly down.

On average, we've got about 5% deposit up for remaining purchase price. Some of the projects we control 18 months, 24 months' supply, others, we control 3 to 5 years' worth of supply in a given project, and it varies. There are certainly some we put up more than 5%, others less than 5% to arrive at that average. We work very hard at developing those relationships with the developer community. Key business partners for us in all of our markets, our division presidents, our land acquisition professionals work very hard to understand their developers and their market and who they need to partner with to get lots put on the ground and then be a good partner to those developers.",1.0149858,0.588

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"In terms of our cost, Buck, per square foot that we typically talk about, our revenues, once again, outpace our stick-and-brick costs on a year-over-year basis. We did see a slightly higher increase in both our revenues per square foot and our stick-and-brick per square foot in the first three quarters of the year. But that really was just driven by the closings mix shift that Mike mentioned in our scripted comments, because we had a higher percentage of our closings coming from the West.",1.7789337,0.255
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,118,Answer,2017-11-09,4,2017,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"So, I'd say, really, we're just seeing more of the same. If you take out the closings mix, we're seeing a very minor increase in our revenues, just enough to cover our stick-and-brick increase. And then the reason you're not seeing that flow through to an increased gross margin is we continue to have a little bit higher land cost flowing through as well.",1.1876896,0.644

My first question relates to economies of scale. Certainly, it is apparent from your results over the last few years, if not longer, that there is a substantive difference in terms of how you're able to translate a given level of demand on the ground up to shareholder value. And it seems that there are economies of scale that maybe weren't really fully realized or realizable 10 years ago or 15 years ago. And I was curious if you could just talk about what kinds of things have changed at the corporate level in the way you're managing your business to extract and to drive these economies of scale, and if all of them are the local level or if you've been able to achieve meaningful ones at the national level?",1.7336669,0.965

And we - the key operators in this company went through that downturn, very painful experience, don't want to go through it again. So, we strive every day to get a little better in everything we do. And I think that has helped and has created a different operating mindset today than we had in 2006.",1.0030781,0.909

Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then, Steven, I have to add to that, just kind of overall, part of the ability to approach the business differently does come to our balance sheet structure. And we are operating in a significantly lower leverage level than we did the last time that we were at this scale. And so - and I think that's important. It does reduce our cost structure, it reduces the risk profile significantly.",1.0828799,-0.052

Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then our approach to land, we're being more efficient there, moving more towards option and having a lower-risk land strategy but also more efficient higher return strategy that allows us to still generate cash flow, while growing is a significantly different position than we were at the last time that we were at this scale. So, we like our position but we still see, obviously, plenty of opportunities to continue to improve on it from where we are.",1.0020929,0.959
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,126,Question,2017-11-09,4,2017,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"Got it. Okay. Second question is on the M&A landscape. I think you said two things that I found particularly interesting. I think, David, you said that you looked for - you look at acquisitions pretty much the same as you look at a piece of land. And I think you also mentioned that you preferred smaller tuck-in deals. And so, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding those two points. So, one is regarding - looking at acquisitions of a piece of land. Generally speaking, we thought that companies such as yourself typically don't like to pay a lot above book value for the acquisitions you look at. And similar to the way you look at a piece of land, I mean, that's where most of the opportunities, it would seem, arise from is a landholding. So, could you talk about what characteristics in an acquisition would encourage you to pay substantially above book value? And then regarding the smaller tuck-in deals, why smaller ones? Is there something about the difficulty to integrate a large deal that concerns you? Because I would think the competition for the smaller deals would be greater than for the larger deals, particularly, with the Asian companies recently on the hunt, it would seem valuations for the smaller deals are kind of getting pushed up. And so, can you just sort of describe your preference for these smaller deals and what the pipeline looks like compared to last year or the year before?",2.0579753,0.963
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,127,Answer,2017-11-09,4,2017,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"I would say that - to start with the end, I'd say the pipeline is probably a little longer today than it was a year ago. And what we're looking for is not necessarily small or big, but - or bigger, but something that is additive to our company, that we can take and grow or integrate some of the things they're doing or the people that they have that make us better. That's - first thing we look at in any acquisition is the culture of the company. And if the culture is not aligned, the people aren't going to be aligned, it's typically not a great deal for us. And the next thing we look about is what kind of premium we got to pay and can we earn that premium back in two years? And if we can't, the deal structure is probably not right for us. We'll let Mike...",0.2677953,-0.294
DHI-2017-Q4-2017-11-13,128,Answer,2017-11-09,4,2017,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"With the current platform we have, we're not being - we're not motivated to pay a big premium for anything that we couldn't otherwise do ourselves. As David said before, if it's not something that's going to make our company better, it's probably something that we'd better up spend our time and effort focused in a different area. I mean, I guess the only thing that would motivate us to want to pay a significant premium over book value would be to end my career at Horton. That, that would pretty much do it, I think.",0.1938049,0.941

I mean - and it's the way it's kind of continued to be for the last several years and it's been - people - the longer the cycle has performed well, the industry has performed well, more and more people have a confidence that they feel like they can price their company comfortable.

I wanted to talk a little about your underlying costs. Thanks for the info on stick-and-brick and land. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the labor market, David? We're starting to hear a little more, a few builders starting to say things are easing, some others are telling us things are tougher. And oftentimes, you'd like to talk about specific trade specific markets. But I'm interested just broadly, what your expectations are for the labor shortage beginning to ease or tighten in 2021?",1.2693344,0.709

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,65,Question,2021-01-26,1,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,So I'm curious if you're thinking about shifting capital investment among the different regions as you look into 2021 and beyond. Is there a de-emphasis happening in the West? Or is it - this loan is just a function of being out of product and out of communities? Thanks.,1.029242,0.813

So through this cycle, our community count has continued to slip down there. I will tell you, we have one of the best groups of people in the company in the West region.

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,71,Question,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one, just on the NAHB had noted that builder respondents were growing more and more concerned with affordability and home price appreciation and also with rates sort of grinding higher. And maybe not specific to D.R. Horton, but for the industry, I mean, how are you guys thinking about this dynamic? And do you see any risk to industry-wide demand as the spring approaches here?",0.4102135,0.827

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,73,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Jessica L.

Our FICO score was 719 this quarter. I think on our Express brand standalone, it was almost 710. And then as we also mentioned on the call, our average square footage has continued to tick down slightly on a year-over-year basis.",0.1352406,0.115
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,75,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"And as home prices have risen, but what we typically see is first time buyers want to buy as much home as they can get for their money, and they're buying out of need, not a discretionary purchase.

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,83,Question,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"But arguably, homebuilding is always difficult to predict. And so I'm curious, what is a good rule of thumb for modeling your cash levels going forward and what are the kind of things that you're looking to fade or dissipate, in order to pave the way for you to hold lower cash levels than that?",0.1578066,0.382
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,84,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. Good question, Steve. Just to get to the point in terms of expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.",0.2498954,0.912
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,85,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market.",0.1146923,0.74
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,86,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18 to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since.",0.0305567,0.805
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,87,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent. I don't see us changing that strategy. I think that just puts us in a very strong and flexible position to respond to market changes.",0.1942235,0.955
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,89,Question,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And paying note to the fact that your guidance for the March quarter suggests that it's more than just a temporary spike. I personally think you're still being conservative, but I'd love to hear what drove the upside surprise in this quarter?",0.2390121,0.273
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,90,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well Steve, I'd say the first thing we expected to see this quarter that we did not as we've been seeing cost increases coming into our business over the last quarter or two, and we expected to see a bit more of that come through in our closings in Q1, which we did not. That's still coming. We can see it coming through our backlog, and we expect to see some of those cost increases start to hit our margins in the coming quarters.",0.8463792,0.871
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,91,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"That being said, we still have a very strong environment, obviously with the ability to raise prices, very low incentive levels. And so, we do expect at this point now with that additional visibility of another quarter to be able to maintain the current margins that we're showing, which obviously are very strong levels.",0.029042,0.494
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,92,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"We've really had price projection on the prior cycle on the material front. And we've seen very neutral impact from materials other than a little bit of headwind from lumber last year. Lumber is starting to pick back up. So that's going into our commentary as well. But really, it's a function of home prices has risen significantly and building product companies have cost inflation as well.",1.2986563,0.0
DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,93,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,David V.

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,94,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"And I'll just add, our operational teams are doing a great job at controlling costs, where we see increases, we look for efficiencies to reduce cost. And I mean, to be honest, I think we were a little bit surprised a stick and brick per foot, actually it went down last quarter. That's just a phenomenal job by our people.",1.1504425,0.941

And Matt, you'll notice that most of that addition to the lot position did come in the form of options lots. We continue to significantly increase our option lot position.

Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain.

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand.

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","But then number two, if I look at the closings and revenue guidance for the year, it seems to suggest that the closing ASPs settled back down a little bit.

DHI-2021-Q1-2021-01-26,108,Answer,2021-01-26,1,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, sure. We always see a higher ASP in our backlog than we do in our sales and our closings because higher priced homes generally are bigger and take longer to work their way through. So that's not necessarily unusual. But yes, so with our sales ASP being at 314 in this quarter, that's definitely showing a continuation of some price appreciation. And so in the near term, we would expect, I think to probably still see some potential upside.",0.6103686,0.439

Even if we did see a compression in our gross margins for whatever reason, affordability, interest rate, something that we don't foresee today as an issue, we can still generate very attractive returns on our current land, bank with the efficiencies that David's kind of already talked to in our business today and our ability to keep turning our houses.",0.4993498,0.812

Deliveries were a little bit ahead of what we had guided to. In addition to ASP is a little higher, which drives a little more SG&A leverage. Something Jessica touched on before is the lower level of completed inventory, especially the completed specs that we're carrying the business today, able to operate the inventory portfolio very efficiently. And that requires less SG&A to maintain and care for those homes while they're sitting completed because we do run those costs through SG&A. So as we have less of those, we had around 5,000 a year ago. And today, we have about 1,600. So that's - that's an improvement and a tailwind as well.",0.4243606,0.637

And we're looking to meet the market and the market's defined by the buyer behavior and it's defined by other competitor behaviors as well. I don't think anybody is as well positioned as our teams have got us into both in terms of product affordability, the communities we have that are now open and the inventory position we have coming in right now. So hard to generalize where we see it, but we empower our local teams to make market decisions every day and to drive their neighborhoods to the right pace to improve the returns on them. And the last part of your question I think was dealing with the land deals. We probably have seen a couple - anecdotally you hear of a couple of land deals coming back around. Maybe it's a little more than normal. It's hard to exactly gauge that. It's not something that's measured very rigorously. But we do see some opportunity that come back around a bit.",1.4118878,0.737
DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,85,Question,2019-01-25,1,2019,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it. Again because I know this is what everybody is really focused on, I wanted to delve a little bit if I could into the tone of the market and your stance towards that strategically and also the impact on margins. So to frame it a little bit, David, when we met up a month or so ago I think, maybe a little bit over a month ago, you had indicated that you weren't as a firm looking to get particularly aggressive on incentives until you had had January sort of under your belt. January's not quite under your belt but your commentary suggest that things have improved to the point where perhaps the level of incentives that you had contemplated you might need to do in the fourth quarter or your first quarter, the fourth calendar quarter, is not what you're expecting you're going to need to be able to do. So I just want to make sure first of all that you have sort of held back in terms of some of the incentives that you were thinking you might have had to do relative to what you had previously thought. And then also if you could remind us where various incentives show up on the income statement? So like some of those actions you do like, whether it'd be rate buy downs or whether it be closing costs or things like that, landscaping, just which ones show up in the gross margin and which ones may show up elsewhere?",0.8658034,0.984

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"To start with the latter and then I'm sure David will also chime in on incentives and margins and his commentary on that, Steve, but any incentive we offer essentially shows up in our home sales gross margins. So whether it be a price reduction, which would impact revenue or any of the myriad of things you just looked at, those would all flow through cost of sales.",0.8894668,0.103
DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,88,Answer,2019-01-25,1,2019,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"And I can tell you, Stephen, the market is performing I would say pretty much as we expected, maybe a little better given the first quarter. So it is - you got to get on budget, you got to keep the community on plan. When you get on budget, it's easier to maintain it than it is to create it. Creating momentum is always more difficult than maintaining it. So it's my expectation that it's going to be a little easier to get people on contract through this spring if it continues. The big debate is a lot of things happen in the market as far as politically, as far as internationally. We take the rates rising in conjunction with cost rising created affordability issues. And coming out of a higher fiscal 2018 and it's kind of the combination of two people paused or became choppier, whatever term you want to call it. They weren't buying houses. So we've seen the market come back. If you talk to Don Horton he'd tell you it's better than he thought it was going to be. I can tell you it's pretty much what I expected. But I'm always been more optimistic than Don Horton. I don't know if that helps or not.",1.0611774,0.973

DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,90,Question,2019-01-25,1,2019,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"Sound great. Thank you. And then second question I had relates to the political environment to some degree. The shutdown obviously has been lingering on for a while now. There's been some thought that some delayed paychecks might have caused some folks who on the margin would have been looking to get into their first home might make it difficult for them to do that and that maybe once this thing is resolved and you get some back pay hitting and maybe also with some tax refunds hitting as well that later in the spring where the spring starts to take shape you might actually have a little bit of boost. So I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see from a cash flow perspective hitting some of these affected people as well as the tax refunds, whether or not you think it's reasonable to think that it might be a little bit of a boost a little later on in the year?",0.7104179,0.874
DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,91,Answer,2019-01-25,1,2019,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"I think that might be a reasonable take but it's not something we're counting on or really have expectations for as it relates to the current government shutdown. Fortunately that's been relatively minimal on our business and we're keeping a close eye on the guidance day-to-day. But really it's impacted USDA which for us is a very low-single digit percentage of our business, it's less than 2% generally of what we've been running including this quarter. So our mortgage company is doing a great job of managing our backlog accordingly. But other than USDA and as you mentioned government employees who aren't getting a paycheck today, there's still ways to work around that from an income verification and the different types of things you have to do. Could it be a modest help down the road? Maybe, but not something we're really worried about right now or relying on being a big uptick.",1.4898136,0.788

Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"I will say, Stephen, government's a huge part of the economy now and the shutdown is going to have ripple effects throughout all the industries. And yes, you just look at consumer confidence and when you have lack of ability to work together at that level, you see confidence coming down which is a big part of our - that's a big part of our business. People got to be confident to buy a home. Again, it just adds to the kind of uncertainty about committing to a number out there in the future today. But if it gets settled, I think it will be a very positive impact or when it gets settled.",1.3455175,0.949

We have the concentration assets in Texas, Florida and the Carolinas. Those have been solid markets. They continue to be solid markets. And don't see any change in the future really. Upside surprise, markets have seemed to be performing better from our standpoint. I'll tell you the Utah market has been somewhat of a pleasant surprise. We've spent a lot of time positioning there. We've got a long term with the company, very focused operator running that market and he has positioned us incredibly well. So very happy with that. It's probably going to be a record year for us in Utah this year. California continues to be soft. Chicago continues to be soft. I do think we are very well positioned in both California and in Chicago with the markets we got. And our operators there I think are doing are better job than at any time I've ever seen in this company. So again, it's people, product and price and you get them aligned and you can have good markets, you can have bad markets. Our goal is to outperform any market. So that's what we focus on.

I think some of the rate spike that we saw in our first quarter did affect some of the entry level buyers. So like 50% of our deliveries were to entry-level buyers, but I think there was a bit of an adjustment period for those buyers with that rate change. And then certainly the moderation was helpful there. I think a lot of our - over the past years we've been focused on even in our Horton brand positioning that product to make it very affordable relative to the alternatives in the marketplace and provide efficiencies to the buyer with that. And so we saw probably a good performance in the Horton brand relative to Express.",0.9669318,0.965
DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,103,Answer,2019-01-25,1,2019,Jessica L.

So we do still think of maintaining our consistent production and sales pace is going to drive not only the best returns but the best margins and particularly pre-tax margins. So we did end up at the low end of our range. I would tell you that October and November and December even though November and December got better, still were weaker than we expected. And so we did give up some margins to find that sales pace again, as David indicated. But typically once you can get back to a consistent sales pace that's the best way to find stability in your gross margin.",1.3181621,0.927

Obviously there was a nice pickup, an opportunistic pickup in your December quarter. But thinking back on how you had been framing your share buyback strategy, you had said earlier that your plan is to just offset dilution and if I look at the activity in the fourth quarter I can look at it as just offsetting dilution even though it was a pick up. But from your comments earlier it sounds like you're willing to go beyond just offsetting dilution. So I just wanted to kind of come back to that. Are you now saying that you will be willing to on a continual basis here go past just offsetting dilution or is that still your kind of main way you're going to approach it?",0.5375,0.878

However, we are keeping the flexibility to remain opportunistic. And so with the buy in the first quarter, that's certainly brought our share count down slightly as we will see further dilution in future quarters and we want to continue to be consistent in our repurchases to offset that.

How does this choppiness in demand affect your approach there? Does it give you the opportunity to - since you still feel good about the market for '19 to maybe be a little bit more aggressive, there are probably more opportunities out there or does it give you some pause in what kind of portfolio you'll build out of there?

DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,133,Answer,2019-01-25,1,2019,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,Typically about a 200 basis point differential between call it a pre-sell or a build job versus a standing spec. Now then it also depends on the age of the spec. So the way you could see even more of a gross margin differential is if we had a completed spec that has been sitting and unsold.

I think Ken let me - to look at what pricing needs to adjust for us to give a number that it needs to be X%, Y% or Z%, we just don't know. What we see is what our sales demand is, what our net sales - our teams are able to go out to the market and meet the market with the sales to hit pace, and they're working with customers, working with buyers and writing contracts and then delivering those homes. And we're watching the margin that's coming in on those sales contracts and the margin that's coming in on the closings. And they're meeting it. And we're not necessarily trying to globally measure from an index price or any other price for the community. It's what is that price house by house, what is that margin house by house and we focus on this business one home, one lot, one family at a time. And it kind of rolls up to what it is and it is - it can me a fairly dynamic number, because a large percentage of our deliveries in any quarter reflect the market conditions of that quarter.

DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,154,Question,2019-01-25,1,2019,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"Right. And just lastly on the gross margin front, you had talked about hoping to see some stabilization there with the potential tailwind in perhaps the back half of the year for lower lumber. At the same time obviously you've been buying land over the last two, three years. I would suspect that there's still somewhat of a rising cost basis from a land perspective in your inventory books. So when we talk about stabilization, are we to think of the upcoming second quarter low 19 range as something where all else equal given that sales pace has come a little bit back in response to the incentives. That's kind of the new base and even - I guess the real question is stabilization at those levels and would a lower lumber kind of just offset higher land cost in the back half.",2.2760125,-0.691
DHI-2019-Q1-2019-01-25,155,Answer,2019-01-25,1,2019,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Mike, as we sit here today and based on the recent sales trends we've seen, we're hopeful - we're cautiously optimistic that we are going to see some stability in our margin and the cost relief we'll get on the lumber ruling for our closings in the latter half of the year should be a part of that. In terms of the land cost, we've actually seen our finished lot cost as a percentage of our overall revenues stay relatively consistent over the last year or two. So I would say to think we have any headwinds coming in terms of our lot cost as a percentage of revenues. I think part of that reflects the fact that we're buying more and more of our lots on a finished lot basis in the current market and so that's adjusting community by community based on market conditions.",1.0886999,0.827

We anticipate, the homes we've gotten started in the fourth quarter are really going to help us deliver the backlog and deliver new spec sales in Q1 and then into Q2. But because we started so many homes in Q4, they're not as far along in the production process, as they normally would be. So they're perhaps a little younger than the average balance might have been. Plus, we just had fewer completed homes in inventory, at the end of September this year, than we did last year.

The gross margin you put up in 4Q, if I'm not mistaken, was the strongest you've seen since 2006, and it certainly seems like there's a pretty significant upward trajectory in that gross margin with a lot of momentum.

When we spoke - last spoke in July, we were seeing unusual demand into the summer. But I think we still had some question as to how long it might sustain.

Having a house that you're going to deliver in 30 days, I did think put you in a very strong position to drive value for the shareholders. So as Mike said, our inventory is much younger.

I would pick up the last comment you made, that it is very tough to keep up with demand today. If we start a home, we see that there's demand for it and it's absorbed in the marketplace.

So we don't necessarily think about them as it to-be-built. It's still very efficient. We're just selling into that pace before we've actually started that home.

And where we have the lots out in front, we build to a pace that maximizes our returns both on equity and inventory. And it's - it's really driven by the individual divisions and the markets that they operate in. I can tell you, we have projects where we've raised pricing an attempt to slow down sales and didn't see much of a change in the sales pace. So it really is driven by the production capability of that division in that submarket as to whether they can deliver more homes or they need to slow it down.",0.1508272,0.0

I mean it's - you're at the back end of a subdivision, you want to drive the highest margin you can. But if you're on the front end or in the middle of a big, big community, which we have numerous big, big communities, you've got to be very careful with your price appreciation on your sales pace. Because nothing stops us like letting, one guy buy at one price and then having to incentivize or drop the price on somebody else down - in three, four months down the road.

What I would touch on is that seasonally, we would expect to see our homes inventory build in the earlier quarters and then start to kind of run down as we satisfy some of that spring selling demand. I think, this quarter, we had 38% of the homes we closed this quarter were sold in the quarter as well. And so, a lot of that reflected with the enhanced margins, our reduced incentives and seeing a buyer return to the market and a little bit of tailwind on some material costs, most notably lumber. We have inventory position where we like it right now, coming to our fourth quarter. We have more inventory right now than we had this time last year.

Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Generally, most of the improvement in our gross margin was driven purely by lower incentives, and not from pricing power. I would say today versus at any point, really, last year in fiscal 2018, we still have less processing power today than we did a year ago. But the pullback in rights has helped. So, it's a little bit better sequentially in that regard. But, the main drivers to our gross margin in Q3 and also what we're expecting, in terms of improvement in Q4, is more from the pullback on incentives.

And our operators in the field are making those pricing decisions to meet the market that they see in front of them. So, I would expect that we would, as Jessica mentioned, in the gross margin guidance, continue to see a little bit improved margin into our fourth quarter. Based on the selling environment we're in today and the strength of the buyer that's coming to our doors, we feel really good about that.

As we've gotten through the spring way and we've been able to see our pace continue at a solid base, we have a greater confidence level in our ability to sell and sell through the homes that we have and deliver on during this fiscal year. Just the sequential improvement visibility, I think was the primary factor. It's a very solid market as evidenced by our ability to pull back incentives throughout the quarter.

It moves, every time we sign a contract or take down lots or cancel a contract. And so, there's a lot of volatility in that. Directionally, the general trend we've had over the past few quarters and past few years, frankly, as we've been working on this has been to push it higher. And we're continuing to work at that. We're working with developers, both Forestar and other third-party developers constantly, looking for ways to expand that controlled lot position and partner with them to deliver communities and lots to us.

DHI-2019-Q3-2019-07-30,82,Question,2019-07-30,3,2019,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. The first question I had was on sales pace, and I guess a little bit of a pace versus price question, but, more focused around sales pace. You've had some competitors that have sales pace up anywhere from mid-single-digits to healthy, very healthy double-digit rates. You guys are a little bit more plus or minus flattish this year. But in contrast, you've had strong double-digit sales pace growth for the prior three, four years. So, my question is, are you just at a point and the mark, your own shift towards first time, which kind of led the industry, kind of in a more of a steady state, and it's kind of taking the market as it is? Because it seems like, most of the builders talk about this improved strength or improving strength at entry level that's driving that higher sales pace, whereas you might already have been there and benefited. I'm trying to just reconcile that because obviously also, it seems like you're a little bit more comfortable today, not necessarily adhering at any price, adhering to the double-digit top-line growth and focusing a little bit more on a balanced approach.",0.0629283,0.996

I think, the way to start with the answer to the question is, we've tried to move to the entry level to the affordable product positioning that's expressed five years ago. And we had been out rolling that out and seeing very good absorption in demand for that product very well received over the past five years. And we did fuel a lot of years of double-digit top-line growth in units.",0.6203432,0.848

And we are now -- we're at a place in our rollout that is fairly mature, we're getting good absorptions for immunity. And from a balanced perspective, we're looking at the pace and price and focusing on what's driving the best returns for our inventory investments. And that's what we're seeing today is that we've got a pace that we're very, very satisfied with in our communities looking at each one of them individually, and then looking to see what can we do to adjust incentives, adjust product offerings, to enhance margins, that then increases overall return in those communities as we're working through.",0.462118,0.973

And now, we're looking to kind of, if you would, turn the sales on the business plan a little bit to maximize the returns we're getting out of those communities, and continuing to look for new communities to replace those. So others -- we've been saying for a long time, as we've opened up communities, we see great demand, and we were not able to satisfy all that demand.

I noticed that the option lot percentage ticked down a point sequentially in the third quarter after, again, several years of very impressive growth and gains in that number. How should we think about the optional lot percentage course over the next couple of years? Obviously, the low-60s kind of exceeded your goal or hit your goal faster than expected.

It is a fairly volatile measurement and we have been very fortunate the past several quarters, it has been nothing but increased. But, it will bounce a little bit from time-to-time. But directionally, over the next few years, we would still expect that controlled lot position to climb above its current level. I would say that there's going to be a rapid accelerated leg with that or anything we can point to as a catalyst to take it immediately up 3% to 5%, 7%, 10%.

Basically, you were running a lot more pre-built homes in 1Q, so you closed higher percent in 3Q as how I look at here your 38% number that you disclosed for intra quarter orders closing. What I'm interested in is your closing for 4Q at the low end, 15,700 up to 16,000, that's interesting and that you have a -- that's a pretty high percent of your under construction, which is how you do everything. Can you explain why that low end of guidance, which is 54% of units and that construction will be up from 49% last year. I know you have specs pre-built homes, which is normal and you had a last year. So, are you getting higher conversion cycles or what is it?",0.18223,0.415

In particular, this year, you decided not to include a margin guide in 2020, and just wanted to get into that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot we can't know about what the next year is going to bring in terms of the economy and demand, from rates. But, there are two things, two factors that I think we can maybe think about, qualitatively. One is the margin on specs, and the second is the lumber benefit, which is you're seeing near-term. On the specs, David, I believe you mentioned that you thought that margins on specs are usually a little lower than the built to order, but not right now, and in part because of the drop in rates, I mean actually, so folks wanted to close quickly and lock in those rates. That benefit to your margin on your specs relative to BTO, I would assume shouldn't -- we shouldn't assume that's going to continue unless rates drop further, which is not something that I would assume you would bake into your outlook.",0.7071807,-0.001

And that's something we do get up every day and think about how to do that. I mean, David talked about, we try to enhance margin every day, we also try to enhance the build time.

And following up on, Jessica, what I think you just said and what Mike and David also touched on earlier. I know, it's not all one size fits all. But, at a high level, what I'm trying to figure out is, you go into the year with a, generally speaking, kind of a unit goal, you put inventory on the ground that positions you to meet that. And so, the question is, as you go through the year and demand kind of fluctuates? Is it the right way to think about what fits best from your results that the swing line is actually on gross margins versus upside or downside on units?

If you do a great job of positioning the product for the price point and demand that exists, then you're going to run a very high margin, in excess of 20%. If you do a very poor job of positioning price point, product, then you're probably going to run a lower margin, because you're -- we are going hit a certain pace, we are going to maintain production in the community and then, adjust out that process.

We have gotten much better at positioning that product. But we're not anywhere near where we want to be, at this point. I will say that every community we've rolled out seems to be a little better positioned, a little better reception from the customer. And it's a brand -- it's going to be a part of this company for a long time. And I think we'll at some point approach 10% plus of our deliveries. The luxury brand, again, we continue to get better at it, nowhere near where we want to be. It gives us areas to focus. Right now, the affordable product lines have driven returns and growth, and we pay our guys based upon returns and profits. So, their focus has been on delivering what the buyer wants. But, there will be a point in time where that will drive a better return than entry levels, at least it has been in past cycles. So, very happy with everything we're doing.

So, labor costs right now quarter-on-quarter holding in flat, we're pleased with the relationships and the teams we have out there negotiating this. Land and development costs are always a challenge that we work back against, a lot of our deep positions and market scale of health with that, and we've now seen a lot of lot cost inflation coming through on this quarter's closings.

DHI-2019-Q3-2019-07-30,146,Answer,2019-07-30,3,2019,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then, the third part of the question, I think is Forestar's lot pricing. We look at for an opportunity that we bring to Forestar that we have tied up, we negotiate with Forestar and they have returned hurdles and metrics that they have to achieve. And our land teams what those are and they'll bring those projects to them and then negotiate take down structures and the pricing to achieve those return hurdles. And if it works for both parties, we go forward with the deal that Forestar does it. If it doesn't work, we can't find a way to make it work, then it's not a deal Forestar does. For an opportunity that Forestar sources, we have the opportunity to get up to have the lots tied up, but that's really, write a first offer or first refusal on those parcels. And, they have their return hurdles; they are out there competitively bidding it in the marketplace with other builders. And they'll work with us where it makes sense. And they'll work with other builders where it makes sense as well. So, they sell both to Horton and they sell to third-party builders as well.",0.60946,0.871
DHI-2019-Q3-2019-07-30,148,Answer,2019-07-30,3,2019,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Sure, Buck. I think you've kind of hit the nail on the head with how we would start, which is 2021 is a long ways out. So, I think a lot can happen between then. And does it fully expire and go away or does some middle ground be reached between now and then, we'll see. It's a long ways out. In terms of our buyers and their debt to income for the buyers that are utilizing our mortgage company, on average for our entire mortgage company this quarter, the DTI percentage was about 42%. So, we do have a decent amount of our buyers that would be at that 43% or above. But, that doesn't mean just because it's the patch were to go away for conventional, there's not a product for them, they'd still be eligible potentially for an FHA loan. And then, the first question we also always ask is do you have other sources of income that we can verify that we haven't yet, to go into that equation?",0.5405288,0.052

Our mortgage company just -- mortgage company does a phenomenal job of working with buyers in our pipeline to find them the different products.

Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve. During the latter part of March, the impacts of COVID-19 and related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business. During April, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for most of our markets, our sales orders decreased and our cancellations increased and our April net sales orders were 1% lower than a year ago. However, as restrictive orders began to be lifted across many markets and economic activity resumed, our sales increased significantly and our cancellations rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods, resulting in a net sales order increase of 38% for the quarter.

So I guess the bottom line question for me is would you like to increase your spec levels from where they are today and are you able to do so in an environment, where demand is as strong as it has been?",0.0662154,0.953
DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,42,Answer,2020-07-28,3,2020,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Answer to your first question, yes, Stephen, we would like to increase our spec levels today. We have aggressive starts planned to increase our specs. At the same time, we will be starting our sold homes. And so it is a big plan to start houses. But as David mentioned before, we have been focusing early on, on the efficiency, in the product, in the operational focus and partnering with our trades and being true that they are capable of supporting the growth that we have in front of us. So we do think we will be able to increase our spec inventory, but it's not going to be without a lot of effort, I can promise you that.",3.0242779,0.925

DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,44,Question,2020-07-28,3,2020,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"Yes, that's great. Very encouraging to hear and obviously we would - we look to Horton to take on those challenges. I wanted to ask a second question about pricing and the pricing environment. It would - it seems obviously that Express remains extremely strong. I am curious if you are seeing increased interest in Freedom and the traditional, D.R. Horton business more recently and whether that allows for a little bit more pricing flexibility perhaps than we had seen in the past, particularly the D.R. Horton semi-custom business. And a second half of that question is whether or not you are seeing the mix of local demand versus out-of-state demand driving what you saw in May and June and is there a difference in your ability to price - push price for when you are selling to a local versus out-of-state?",1.1180106,0.982
DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,45,Answer,2020-07-28,3,2020,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"I would say, as to the branding, we are seeing uptick in demand for both Freedom and the D.R. Horton brand. As to the state question, I would say we're seeing increase in demand from both of my profiles. The relocation of people down to a more affordable tax-friendly environment continues. I think COVID maybe is even accelerating that. Pricing is something we track week-to-week, based upon demand at each individual flag and it's kind of - I've always considered pricing at our sites. You want to - you never want to be in a position where you push pricing so hard that you have to come back and adjust it back down. You always want people to feel like if they buy today, they will save a little bit money - they will save money versus buying 6 months or a year from now. So, fortunately, our company, the entire structure and mentality is that those decisions are made in the individual communities and divisions and the people that are closest to the market actually, we feel make a better decision than we can make up here.",0.2924202,0.942

It's just a lot of uncertainty out there that is completely outside of our control. If you just look at long-term price in the industry, demographics, where the supply is versus where the future demand is going to be or should be even today, you got to feel very-very good about the long term. But in this industry, I mean you saw what happened at the end of March completely out from nowhere.

Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, I would say that we are generally going to be in line with - the started sold homes are across the range of production largely at this time of the year, delivering into the fourth quarter and similar with the specs. We are probably maybe a little bit less finished with the specs because of the strong sales demand that we've had, they've moved to the sold category and we have them sort of set to close, if you will - sold to close in the September quarter. So, we feel really good about the ability to deliver the fourth quarter and the starts plan that we have out and the building permits we're able to accumulate. We feel good about being able to reload the inventory and bring us back to sustainable inventory levels we need to support the demand.",0.9007953,0.913

I think that's a trend that was in place before the COVID-19 program and I think it's really tied toward the millennial being a more conservative disciplined buyer of homes than previous generations. They were forming households later, having children later, and I think this pandemic has accelerated that trend. And like - what do you call it - pent-up demand or pull forward demand or there is just a whole lot of people out there that I think are going to be looking for housing over the next five plus years.",0.1335129,0.382

I think what you are referring to is a longer term trend I think is continuing as I think certainly pandemics had an effect on it. We would generally agree that that is a trend that probably is accelerating right now, but it's still too early to know the depth of that and the sustainability of it. So, we try to just comment on what we see in front of us and then we'll live into the rest and be able to comment on the depth of that as time marches on.",0.3313082,0.351
DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,69,Answer,2020-07-28,3,2020,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, broadly on the price and incentive, as David mentioned before, it's a very local decision that's made. I can tell you that we did see very strong sales demand and so the level of incentives we were offering on sales later in the quarter were much lower than where we opened the quarter with. So, we did see firming pricing trends, firming incentives and in turn - but to see where that's going to go, we're going to need the market and right now we feel really strong about the sales trends that we're seeing without needing to do heavy incentives. But everyday, at Horton Communities, there is some level of incentives and potential pricing adjustments to meet the market whether that's up or down, and we do see tremendous value created with the urgency for buyers, as David mentioned before, feeling like they will save a little bit of money if they act today rather than wait for a few more weeks.",0.3470071,0.982

So, our focus has been and will continue to be relationships with the developers. The fact that our operational teams in these markets have been there a long time, have great relationships with land sellers I think gives us some advantage. Our ability to close gives us an advantage. Our absorptions per flag, if you are developing lots, you want to be selling to somebody who is going to drive very high absorptions. So it's - I do believe we have a competitive advantage, people and capital and just operational efficiency. So I can tell you right now we are seeing a lot of deals. The COVID scare, I think, really created opportunities for us to open relationships with sellers that had been primarily selling through other competitors. So, feel very good about our land position today and the things we put in place to sustain that over time.",3.108888,0.96

First question, I didn't catch and apologies if you had mentioned it, what your average community count did this quarter either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis?

DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,75,Answer,2020-07-28,3,2020,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Sure, Mike. Our community count was flat both sequentially and year-over-year. And as you can imagine, with our very strong sales pace, we might not be in a position to see community count growth in Q4. It will probably stay closer to flat, maybe slightly down. But we have the lot position to continue to deliver homes and communities going forward. So, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive absorptions and ultimately have some community count growth that may just be pushed a little bit further out later next year.",1.0364109,0.942
DHI-2020-Q3-2020-07-28,76,Question,2020-07-28,3,2020,Michael Rehaut,JPMorgan Chase,"Okay. Also with - I was just kind of curious about kind of on this topic, with Forestar, giving out guidance of midpoint of about 11,000 lot deliveries for next year and I believe that was a little bit below their prior guidance, pre-COVID and understanding that obviously there is a disruption perhaps in some of the development activities for a month or two. At the same time, you guys are looking at very, very strong results currently and into July, I was just trying to get a sense for maybe how that reconciles, Forestar maybe looking at a bit less of a delivery year than originally planned despite demand coming back extremely strong for you. How those two kind of fact patterns work against each other, because I would have thought perhaps and maybe it's just a more of a timing issue, but a 1,000 lots is not immaterial, so, just trying to get a sense of how to reconcile those two data points?",0.5339564,0.715

And Forestar was reestablishing just preliminary delivery guidance for fiscal '21 at a time in which their largest company - largest customers not providing 2021 guidance. So, it's just early, felt like it was important for Forestar to reestablish at least a baseline expectation for their top line growth next year given that they are truly a growth story and the revenues have been up over 200% this year, but it is a bit conservative we hope. And as we live over the next few months and as D.R. Horton gets sufficient visibility to provide guidance for fiscal 2021, our hope would be if certainly if demand trends continue as they are right now, the strength continues in the industry, I would expect that Forestar would ultimately be able to exceed that and increase their guidance over time. This is really timing.",1.671932,0.976

On the gross margins, obviously, a lot of strength there and you mentioned that you are getting some pricing power back obviously, which makes sense? Is there - and I know you are not giving fiscal '21 guidance at this point, but just conceptually perhaps, if you are looking at your gross margins and backlog currently and what you are seeing on the ground, in terms of just achieving some incremental pricing, achieving some incremental scales, etcetera. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able to hit like the 22% gross margin next year with all those factors just given the momentum you have right now. Again, just trying to think conceptually, obviously, I know you are not giving guidance right now, but just along those lines, if you have any thoughts?",0.2130841,-0.814

But looking forward, we could see that there could be some headwind coming at us from lumber later into the fourth quarter and into early '22 - early '21 excuse me, I am getting confused in my ears. And we do have a backdrop right now of the strong demand environment and some pricing power and relief on incentives. So, we have some positive tailwinds, but we also have some headwinds and there is still the broader outlook that we are looking at here of what's going to happen in the economy and how the pandemic progresses through the fall and into the winter of next year. So we feel very good about being consistent with our level of margins to drive the right pace that ultimately for us is looking to drive the right return and that's what we are ultimately looking at it every community says how we maximize the return we built with every [indiscernible].",4.2473838,0.882

I am not sure where that's coming from. Okay. And in terms of our overall company-wide ROI, Mike, we are at 21.6%, which I think is probably a record return on inventory that we have generated that delivering, almost 20% return on equity as well.

We went through a very volatile quarter in terms of demand in terms of what we had to do in our operations and in the adjustments we have made there and still going forward, it's in our forward visibility. We are seeing extremely strong demand. We have seen a sell-through of our spec inventory. So we are actively reaccelerating our specs now. So first and foremost, we are focused on our business and what we feel like we need to reinvest to keep our spec inventory at the level we would like and keep our lot inventory replenished. And so until we get a better sense of what that need is in the core business, then we will adjust our - then we will put our plans in place for share repurchase over the next few months, we will be sitting down with all of our operators across the company and putting in place our business plans for fiscal '21. And as we get that set, then that will help further define and give us better clarity on what we'll do in terms of our share repurchase. So, our statement is we are going to cautiously manage our share repurchase and we still have an authorization in place and we'll update those plans accordingly as we get better visibility in our business.",1.0473259,0.985

We have seen significant and competitive advantage results from the continued consolidation and market share gains. There is - what we focus on internally is consistent sustainable operations and feel very good about our pace right now. The market is certainly there and the pricing side - short-term price increases actually increase demand sometimes. So, again, it's an art and we leave those decisions to local markets. So, like Bill said, over the next 30 days we will be putting together an operating plan for '21 finalizing. I guess, we've had one for some time, but finalizing it and that will drive a lot more visibility about how we're going to position for '21 and then '22 and then '23.",3.1919969,0.87

Our cycle times have been very consistent really throughout. And backlog conversion really isn't a stat that we focus too much on. We focus more on our inventory position and our inventory turns. And right now, we're seeing our inventory turns accelerate. Our sales pace obviously has increased dramatically in the last few months, which did work down our completed homes - completed specs. So, our completed spec inventory is lower than it has been in some time. Also, the component of our backlog that is sold, but not started is higher than normal. So, as we accelerate our starts pace, that will bring those to back to a closer - closer to a normal level, and we expect to still deliver very strong volume.

The first question I wanted to go back to the sold but not started in backlog and I think you guys mentioned a few times and Bill, you responded to a previous question that percentage is higher than normal, which makes sense. Could you actually - could you give us what that percentage is in terms of what's sold but not started and how that compares on a year-over-year basis? And maybe as part of that, I don't know if you have any quantification of kind of like what an average - I know your build cycle is flat, but what an average delivery quote would be in terms of what you are able to quote to new buyers today versus what you would normally be able to?",0.3976871,0.725

Right now, we would not be able to quote to you an average because it's going to vary based upon which community you're in and the level of production that's available within that community and the type of product that it is. In some communities, we have a very quick build time and can deliver homes from start to completion in three months. In others it may be a four or five-month build cycle. And then generally, we're looking if we have inventory that's available to move in within the next 30 days as soon as you can clarify your mortgage situation and get qualified.

The - are you getting the sense that your local operators are - given some of the uncertainty that may still be out there, they are making the decision to let pace run a little hard for the foreseeable future just to capture what's out there while it's still out there type of mentality versus those operators pushing price more aggressively.

Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Mike, the pace versus price versus margin has a lot to do with community size or it is in the community. You may push price in a community where you're on the back end of it and your deliveries sales pace is going to be three or four months' worth of inventory or 6 or 7 months' worth of inventory. And then you have other communities where you might have a thousand lots in front of you and driving pace actually generates a higher return than trying to find that absolute right margin dollar that either cuts off sales or allows sales to increase. And we trust our operators in the field to make those decisions we incentivize them to make good decisions. And it's a model that's been a part of the company for the 32 years I've been here and it seems to be working. So, it really is a community by community process.",1.2947287,0.844

We were much better positioned coming into this first quarter this year than we had been, and we were able to execute against that. The market therefore is a very solid market. I wouldn't say we saw significant deviations within the quarter month-to-month. It was a pretty consistent result for us. In January, the Cowboy lost. So, in this part of the world, the selling season is kind of starting now. So, we're excited about the silver-lining on that cloud for us.

And if you've got a product to 250, you can still support this. So, we like our positioning. As far as absorption for our community, at some point, no, you're not going to be able to sustain and continue. But our focus has been driving to 20% ROI. And so, we're going to drive absorption levels and improve ROI. And at some point, we're going to max out. The return we can make up of lag, and at that point, we will add flags.",0.5378992,0.865

So, clearly, we're off to a strong start. And we can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter and how we get there for the year. As you saw, our sales were outside of that up 8% to 13% range. We could have a quarter where our sales are under that 8% to 13% range, but we feel very comfortable that for the full year, our closings will be up at least 8% to 13%.",0.7962722,0.918

My first question actually revolves around cost control. I mean, I know that you are always focused on leveraging your scale with your vendors. But I think that recently you've conducted a pretty significant rebidding process with some of your suppliers. And I was wondering if you would be willing to share what you think the overall savings opportunity might be from those conversations?",0.4526192,0.988
DHI-2017-Q1-2017-01-24,37,Answer,2017-01-24,1,2017,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Stephen, we're constantly rebidding our suppliers and our vendors across the board. We've had several pushes over the last several years really in which we pushed hard on rebidding. And so, yes, that's a continual effort for it, and we're continually working to mitigate certainly any cost increases and improve our cost wherever we can. On a year-over-year basis, our costs, our stick and brick cost which were put, were up only 2%, which is certainly a more moderate than we saw a couple of years ago. And so we've been able to keep our revenue growth per square foot exceeding our cost per square foot on the stick and brick basis, which is certainly helping us going forward. We're seeing lot cost start to increase, lot costs were up 9% on a per square foot basis this quarter.

I mean, we've seen your net debt to cap already now well below, what I would consider historical norms, and it seems to be on track to trend lower this year, giving a strong cash flow. I was wondering if you could talk to us about how you think about what the right level and what trajectory is appropriate for your leverage at this time, as we're seeing some recent demand indicators inflecting upwards?",0.3331371,0.881

To the extent that we're able to still grow at a solid pace and consistent double-digit pace over the course of a year, and we're able to invest sufficiently to support that growth in 2017 and beyond and maintain a sufficient land pipeline, to the extent we're able to support that level of growth and still generate positive cash flow. From our standpoint, we don't have an ideal leverage level. We will take that cash flow and then do what we feel like is best in the interest of our overall Company, and our shareholders for the long term.",0.6711219,0.98
DHI-2017-Q1-2017-01-24,41,Answer,2017-01-24,1,2017,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","And so an element of that that we've prioritized this year is to continue to de-lever. We expect to generate $300 million to 500 million of cash flow, while still supporting our growth. And we're going to use $350 million of that to pay down debt, while continuing to reinvest in the business and continue to pay strong dividend to our shareholders, which we've increased and expect to pay about $150 million in dividends this year.

Very, very strong conversion ratio, I think, the strongest in five years, just wanted to dig into that a little bit. You mentioned you're obviously driving absorptions in communities. That may have played a part of that. But on the other hand, there's still, I think, pretty widespread concerns about labor. And so, how should we think about that?

That is a great indicator of future closings, because we're getting the houses we want out of the ground, we're getting them where we want, and working them through to completion and then we're closing them. That's for us a much better predictor of closings volume in a given quarter perhaps than backlog conversion is. In terms of back to normal, I don't whatever is normal in this business, it seems like the conditions are always changing a bit year-to-year. And we're building a platform that allows us to respond to those market conditions, and look to position our communities in front of the market with the trades we need to build the houses when we want to get built.",0.5929204,0.923

I think it might be your first single-digit number you've ever reported, very strong performance. You mentioned that look, hey, don't expect the same level of improvement on the subsequent quarter, just wanted to dig into that a little bit. What drove the strong performance that might reverse in the subsequent quarters? Obviously, you've got the corporate relocation coming up that might be a factor.

There wasn't anything unusual there in the cost at all. It's was really driven by the revenue line. We had guided to -- we exceeded the guidance that we provided for our backlog conversion in the first quarter, back to your first question. So our revenues were higher than that guidance range.

And you saw, I would say, a deceleration in traffic, less consumer confidence deal from our sales agents. We fought through it. I think we ended with a pretty good 2013. But it did have a significant impact. Right now, the over-optimism that seems to be up there in the market, just traveled through Florida, and I'll tell you, Florida feels like it is going to market as I've seen the long time. Our sales agents were very excited. And we have inventory that right now we're in the best competitive position we've ever been.

I think those are very positives, because we'll see good household formations, we'll see good confidence by the consumer, and able to adjust to a gradual rate rise that seems to be telegraphed.

Really, our outlook on community count is the same as it was last quarter. We expect community count from where we are today to still remain relatively flat over the next few quarters. At some point, we would expect it to increase. But right now, our community opening schedule would indicate that it's going to stay relatively flat. So sequentially, relatively flat, which would, it still indicate the year-over-year decrease. So, in this quarter, community count was down 5% but with the 20% absorption improvement, our sales are 15%; so, in the short to medium term, still relatively flat.",0.5713688,0.743

Eric, I think also what we're seeing is the impact of some of the communities we're opening now are frankly more productive communities than some that are closing off. We've been focusing on a return based model for the past several years, and the fruit of that's coming through. We're seeing our return on homebuilding inventory jump up almost 300 basis points on a trailing 12 month basis over where it was a year ago. And our discipline around living within our means inventory wise and being very focused on the balance sheet has encouraged our field teams to be very selective in the community to bringing in line and whether deploying their capital as to whether it gets the most turn out of that capital. So, that's what we're seeing, I think, some good pickup in our absorption on a flag-by-flag basis.",0.8434013,0.886

And we certainly feel like we can compete effectively and sustained, and grow. We're just rolling out in the west and just actually rolling out in Phoenix to kind of early in the stages in Denver, and maybe it's got a -- we feel like we've got a quite a bit of runway there.

And I am happy to follow up on the specific that we've given on most of our calls over the last couple of years. In fiscal '15 is really where we started to see the sharpest increase in both, really primarily labor and to some extent materials. Therefore, a couple of quarters, we did experience a high single-digit percentage increase in our stick and brick cost per square foot, which was outpacing our revenues at that point in time. As we moved through the end of '15 and into '16, we were able to get that closer to call it a mid single-digit percentage. And our revenue started catching up with that stick and brick costs, which is where you saw our gross margin really start to stabilize and become very consistent for the last, call it, six to eight quarters now.",0.8118769,0.758

This is all stick and brick that I've been talking about. In terms of lot costs, lot costs, if you go back to '15 and '16, pretty needed increases really into the back half of '16, which was when we started seeing, call it a mid to high single-digit increase in lot costs. And this quarter is one of the higher in terms of we were up 9%, as Bill mentioned earlier, for a lot cost increase on a per square footage basis.

As we compete in every community and we continue to have affordable product out there, that's always our goal. If you look, really, when you look at share you have to look over a longer trend. And we certainly over the longer term have been pretty consistently gaining share, and that's certainly our goal going forward; market by market, community-by-community and then rolling-up to the overall companies to continue to gain share in marketplace, and looks like we're in really good position to do that. We're looking to position our communities our homes to be the best choice for every customer in every market that we're serving.

First question, I was hoping to dig into the Freedom homes rollout a little bit. You're still on track, it appears, and expecting to be in the third of your markets by fiscal '17 end. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of, and maybe remind us if we talked about this last quarter. But how does that Freedom brands product defer from your corporate average in terms of ASPs and sales pace? And given that it would appear that this is a market share gain opportunity.

And then my second question is on SG&A, obviously continues to be a hallmark of the Company. It was interesting I was looking back at the past cycle. And in 2004, when you did a similar amount of homes close that you're guiding for this year, you actually also had an SG&A of about 9.1, it looks like in that year. And what struck to me was is that there are many builders today talking about maybe having a lower cost structure this cycle versus last, either through digital marketing, which is something that you guys talked about as well. But I was -- just the similar amount of closings and similar SG&A, would suggest the similar cost structure. And I was wondering if there is some pluses and minuses to your business model, from a cost standpoint, certainly what comes to mind is your three or four brands today, which might require a little bit more SG&A relative to your singular approach last cycle.

And you're right, as far as where we were on SG&A as a percentage for the entire year in all four to similar closings was at 9.1 is a difference between then and now, as we were seeing significant price depreciation in our homes. In 2004, the data that I'm looking at it was a high single digits ASP increase then, which obviously creates a lot of SG&A leverage.

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,59,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one, I guess, it really seems like the asset-light strategy that you guys embarked upon a few years ago is really hitting stride now. I mean, option percentage up to close to 75%, and buybacks now expected to actually lower the share count. So these are all things that we had hoped for some time, and again, it really seems to be hitting stride.",0.725279,0.58
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,60,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Two questions on that. I mean where do you now see sort of the target percent option? I know it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but any change in the view longer term on that? And then, has the view now on buybacks, has that changed? Do you think that you'll actually be able to continue chipping away at the share count over time?",0.0269334,0.7
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,61,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"John, I'd say we're always going to try to get better and continuing to push the auction as a percentage of total. We consider that a better utilization cap. So if we're at 75% now, over time, we would expect to turn that into 80%, and we'll get to 80% over time. If different market conditions, it could grow beyond that.",0.3936129,0.813
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,62,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","So it's - it's just - you know, like every time we do, we talk about sustainable, scalable, and that follows right on track. We believe that auctioning lots is - will drive better cash flow, better returns to our shareholders, and as our builders on our platforms out there execute that strategy, relationships grow stronger, and it's just a - there's a momentum that I think will continue.",0.2985014,0.844
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,63,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","And then John, with respect to share repurchases, I would use the word sustainable as well there. As we have progressed in our capital light strategy, as we've generated more cash flow, as we have gotten in position with our scale to reinvest in our business to support the scale that we believe that the market will bear today.",0.1899554,0.758
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,64,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP",And we've improved our balance sheet and our liquidity position. We are now in a position where I do think we have hit an inflection point where I think we can more definitively talk about consistently repurchasing shares and consistently reducing our share count over time.,0.5236938,0.288
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,65,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","And so, we had a little bit of interruption with COVID last year in which we paused. We reinstated share repurchase last quarter and then this quarter, we've accelerated. And now with the new authorization, we are more definitively stating that we expect to consistently reduce our share count each year going forward, and that will be part of our balanced program.",0.5236938,0.838
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,66,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. That's really encouraging on both fronts, guys. The second question is, we have heard through the channel of what I would characterize as maybe seemingly aggressive behavior by some of your competitors in terms of whether it's you know, prices being paid for land, potentially even cutting some corners to get homes closed. Just curious, if you guys have heard any rumblings like this in the market? And if so, I mean, does it maybe suggest that things are getting a little bit too heavy a heal overall?",0.0092343,-0.272
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,67,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. John, we've seen on a very limited basis some erratic behavior on the land front, where a builder has positioned themselves where they just don't have adequate or even non-adequate supply of lots, they are buying out of desperation. But it hasn't been consistent across all the markets and even within markets where I have seen it, it's not impactful to the overall land valuation.",0.2793382,0.681
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,68,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","You know, our entire process through this cycle has been to auction lots, take longer positions where we control pricing through this market, and I think we said it on every call, we are incredibly well-positioned on our lot supply. And if somebody is being erratic, then we will - they're going to be in a very difficult position to compete if they're accelerating - if they're overbidding land price, because we are - we're pretty efficient in delivering houses, and our land pipeline is long and deep and very well priced.",0.3718104,0.859
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,69,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","John, back to your other question about closing homes before they're ready. We've been in this business a long time and certainly have kind of learned a lesson that we don't want to close the home before its time. So we will wait until the home is ready, and the buyer is satisfied with the home to be in there.",0.1174565,-0.272
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,70,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","At the same time, buyers are very anxious to get in their homes. Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that.",0.2385581,0.68

Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Selling homes after we've started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date, and we're able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they're coming from.",1.6938032,0.875
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,75,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the results and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about the revenue guidance, and it's entirely possible I missed it, but just to the extent you are raising the full-year revenue guide by about, I guess, $1.7 billion at the midpoint, but delivery is up about 2,500 at the midpoint, it seems like there is a lot more revenue there than would be implied by the deliveries. Just what else is driving that uptick? Thank you.",2.4588902,0.875
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,76,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. With the sales price increases that we have seen in recent quarters, with the sales price increase we've seen in our net sales orders this quarter, we are anticipating a further increase in our closing average prices in Q3 and Q4 versus where we've been in the first two quarters. So there is some expectation and visibility to increase sales prices in that revenue guide.",2.1223167,0.911
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,77,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","As well, our total consolidated revenues, it does include our financial services revenues as well, and we're seeing very strong net gain performance there. And so there is probably a bit more contribution from that segment of our business into the consolidated revenue guide as well.",1.0299716,0.863

Second one, I wanted to ask about the administration's first time buyer plan that was laid out the other day. It's obviously much more, I guess, surgically targeted than the broad plan that was initially presented. But do you have any insight into what portion of your buyers might qualify under this down payment plan as it was laid out? Thank you.",0.2704811,0.637
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,79,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"I don't have a percentage to share with you, Matt. Honestly, we haven't spent a whole lot of time on that to date. I do think it's a narrower target than what was initially proposed. And so I don't know that we expect it to move the needle a whole lot.",0.7373212,0.722
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,80,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"Honestly, the market strength today is extremely robust, and we don't really need anything to increase demand further or put more pressure on home prices, which is ultimately what more buyers, with a limited supply in the market, can drive.",1.1915908,0.586
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,81,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Jessica L. Hansen,Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications,"So we're going to continue to maintain our focus on affordability, and I'm sure our mortgage company will be focused on what we need to do on that front. And we'll support those buyers as they come into our sales offices, if that is something they can take advantage of, but we don't expect that to be a big impact overall.",0.857824,0.44
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,86,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, I was hoping you could kind of talk to what's driving that increased guidance? If it's perhaps some improved efficiencies in the field? If it's better supply chain arrangements or with certain key providers of either lumber or on the labor side, we would love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that?",1.0276266,0.92
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,87,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"Thank you, Michael. What's giving us confidence from the ability to raise our deliveries guidance has been the starts we've been able to get out for the past two, three quarters, frankly, we've had very strong home starts, and that's a result of our teams positioning their operating platforms to be able to have a sustained production cadence in a given neighborhood, in a given submarket.",1.1444119,0.0
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,88,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Michael J.

We're able to give them a consistent and plan full starts program that they can then plan their business back to.,0.6580159,0.794
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,89,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"On the materials side, there certainly has been, what they'll call, a Whac-A-Mole game of trying to find the latest thing that we're out of with our purchasing scale and a lot of our national partners that we've been working with, they've been really good at helping us get product into homes that we need to close the homes. And those teams have deep relationships with multiple channels in their markets, able to get the components we need to complete the homes.",0.2298033,0.958
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,90,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Michael J. Murray,Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President,"So honestly, our build times have elongated a little bit here lately. It's not surprising, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made at holding the line and the confidence we have in our production process today to up our guidance for the year and deliver more homes into the strong demand we're seeing.",1.8534952,0.83
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,93,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","How should we think about sales pace in the back half from current quarter levels?

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,94,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","Sure, Mike.

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,96,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","But that being said, the quarterly sales order pace, when you look at the sales order pace last year in Q3 and Q4, we had some very strong levels that are some very strong comps that we're up against in the back half of the year.",0.2029162,0.502
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,97,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Bill W. Wheat,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP","So on our normal cadence and in positioning ourselves to grow double-digit next year, our sales order comparables year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 could be in the range of flattish, slightly up, slightly down, but that doesn't really change the positioning that we're going to be in, in terms of growing our top line and our bottom line in fiscal '21 and positioning ourselves for fiscal 2022.",2.1437829,0.936
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,101,Question,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,Can you maybe talk about the cadence of how you expect your communities to grow over the next couple or three years based on that significant increase in lot?,0.0230858,0.128

I mean when you look at our lot count, a lot of that is option positions that are going to deliver over the next year or two years, and then last for two to three years beyond that.",0.1754521,0.45
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,103,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V.

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,104,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V. Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"So it's about scale, it's about driving consistent discipline starts. And demand right now is - it is really good. And so when Bill mentioned that our starts pace is driving our sales pace, I mean, that is the reality. If we could start more houses, we'd be selling more houses.",0.2708734,0.625
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,105,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V.

And so if they have visibility what their work process load is going to be over the next 60, 90 days. And does scale matter? Absolutely, scale matters. And I feel like every month, every - really, every day, every week, every month, our competitive position, because of our scale, because of our discipline, has just grown.

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,110,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Jessica L.

We can increase absorption if we can increase production capacity and capabilities. So our operators, our construction managers and everyone is looking for how can we continue to expand our starts pace each week, whether that's finding additional trades or helping our trades be more efficient, so they can do more homes in the same amount of time.

So we would continue to point you to our lot count as a driver. If we have a finished lot, we're going to start a home ultimately, and we're going to sell and close it.

I think we would agree with the latter that pricing may lag a little bit, but we clearly are seeing the ability to continue to push price. Our first time homebuyer percentage is actually up year-over-year, 57% compared to 53% last year, and we actually saw it tick up to the high 60s for Express.

If it's possible to generalize, are you seeing price increases among competitors as being steeper than D.R. Horton communities? If so, is it possible to quantify how much - you know, whether that's 0.5 point or 1 point? Is that continuing to kind of drive your value proposition versus customers? Or do you think that the rate of increases is maybe more in line with some of your large competitors here?",0.2019939,0.0
DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,139,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,Jessica L.

DHI-2021-Q2-2021-04-22,140,Answer,2021-04-22,2,2021,David V.

And so we probably are not as aggressive as some of the other builders have been in raising prices. I mean, our margins are great, our returns are phenomenal, but we're in this for the long haul.

That low teens growth is good, but I wonder why the spec component - the growth rate in the spec component has declined.

If you look at our ASP on closed houses we actually saw a slight dip this last quarter, while we improved margins.

My first question relates to the comment you made David, about the importance of discipline and I think that's something that really has been a focus I know of yours in the company and in the management team over the last few years. With respect to discipline, we were looking at your ROA across your regions recently and I was kind of surprised to see just how wide the spread of returns on assets were across your different reporting regions, it was actually among the widest we have seen - we see in the group.",0.2604473,0.925
DHI-2018-Q1-2018-01-31,113,Question,2018-01-31,1,2018,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,"And I was curious, if you just sort of comment on the degree - why we are not seeing the discipline and the controls and the overall strength of Horton not also manifest itself in perhaps somewhat more similar returns across the regions, if that's even a meaningful metric or goal or aspiration at all and if not, why not?",0.2295468,0.778

When I look at these operations and like the Northeast or Arizona a couple of years ago, actually opportunities get better and that's what we're striving to do is overtime get better.

If I could extend the question again a little bit in a slightly different way talking about discipline. We've also been very intrigued to note that this cycle is the first housing up cycle where we've seen eight consecutive years of housing start increases. That's never happened in the history of the country. So while housing may still be as cyclical as it ever was, it has been noticeably less volatile than in prior cycles.",2.1127134,0.886
DHI-2018-Q1-2018-01-31,117,Question,2018-01-31,1,2018,Stephen Kim,Citigroup,And I was curious if you could talk about if you think housing demand is more likely it's likely become more volatile in the next couple of years in a potentially rising rate environment.

How that might be more visible or visible in a more volatile market if we were to have one?,0.5844614,0.673

We feel that's very important to maintain an affordable product out there in any environment. And that's really still the most underserved segment of the market today is at the affordable end of the price range. So as we go into a period where we're now interest rates are rising, we believe we're in a very good position to compete in that scenario.

It has been eight years of increasing housing starts, but they're increasing from a very low level at a very slow trajectory relative to continued population growth household formations.

Auld,President & Chief Executive Officer,"I think, the other contributing factor to what has extended this housing cycle has been the lack of financing for small builders and independent developers. That typically that's how the market gets oversupplied. Lawyers become developers and doctors become lawyers and it's a - they put product out there that there is no demand for. And what's you're not seeing and it's not just the D.R. Horton it's all the builders. Much more disciplined, we all went through that downturn. And we didn't enjoy.

That has typically been our preferred method of distribution to shareholders through the years and it continues to be.

First, thinking about the 60% optioned lot target which you folks have mentioned again here and I think you have been talking about that pretty consistently. How do we think about the increment from here at 50% to 60% relative to Forestar? The 10,000 lot deliveries by 2020 would seem to make up - would seem to help make up most of that progress from 50% to 60%. Is that roughly where that difference is going to come from?

Now you folks have been pretty consistent in describing that if rates are rising relative to a better growth pattern that's fine.

So if they do rise very sharply in a short period of time, we would expect some period of impact, while buyers' mindset resets and adjust to that higher rate.

First question, just another high level question around how to think about the impact of Forestar and I guess if we're thinking about these 10,000 lots or as you go up further clearly more. But these are deals that buy and large would have otherwise been either been either sourced to other third party partners or brought on your own books if I'm - or A, would be am I thinking about that correctly; and then B, if so is it then more of an issue from an accounting standpoint of you'll capture the additional margin on having developed those lots through Forestar versus outsourcing them to total third party?

And so while we're in the process of doing right now is putting deals in place to build a pipeline just help them build that foundation and build that platform across the country.
