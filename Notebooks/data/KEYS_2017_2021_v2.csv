Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051,000,000, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000.

We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength in networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical layer test.

In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test.

ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales.

This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold.

Where would you say were the biggest areas that surprised to the upside relative to your guidance? And then just look out to fiscal '19, any goal posts you can share with us relative to your 4% to 5% long-term top line growth target? Understanding you're lapping pretty tough comps, but what areas of the business you think get stronger versus those might moderate a bit?",,0.872
KEYS-2018-Q4-2018-11-20,38,Answer,2018-11-20,4,2018,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brandon, one of the good things is that a lot of our growth initiatives there are hitting on all cylinders and continue to break the records. 5G is the area that is -- has grown triple digits as we had talked about, and it continues to be very strong and very strong around the world. And that feeds into our commercial communications business, which is also very strong as we reported our revenue for overall for China. That was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our services business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business has grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from commercial communications and automotive seem to be strong. There's is no doubt that we do have a tough compare compared to with this last year, which the performance was so much better than the year before, but we actually see upside to that 4% to 5%.

I think we feel like we're at the front end of the number of secular themes that will continue to provide growth opportunities for us moving forward. As you mentioned, Brandon, the 2018 growth will provide some tougher comps for us, particularly in the back half of the year. We're weighing that with the strength we see in our growth initiatives with some potential headwinds in China as well as in semi. But all in all, we see some upside to the 4% to 5% long-term growth target that we put out there for the company, and we feel we have a broad portfolio of solutions and selling to diverse set of end markets, and believe, we're well positioned across that entire space.",1.0364794,0.976

Well, let me just start and say, overall, although we have at a record year, all is not perfect. The Ixia integration has become a bigger job than we had thought it originally. We're making excellent progress, but it's taking longer than we originally thought. And we have a -- we've a multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our general Communications Solutions Group.

But we are consolidating the CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they're not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. We still have a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution, the AresONE solution for 400 gig, it is the denser solution to go ahead and to address this need. Compared to the competition, it's very, very strong.

I think, as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition has taken us longer than we expect, but we would point to the strong order growth rates that we saw in the quarter. And you mentioned revenue synergies, I think, we can point to Ixia's success in China, particularly at some of the bigger customers that have been strongholds for Satish's commercial communications business and the winds that we're getting there as evidence that we are getting revenue synergies in this business. So I think as we look forward, we remain confident in our thesis and that as wireless -- as 5G rolls out and wireless and wireline converts the ability to provide end-to-end solutions across communications ecosystem by bringing these businesses together in the end is a winning strategy.",1.8459757,0.987

Clearly, on one way you look at 5G as a wireless standards evolution, but it's really causing the entire communication block diagram to be reconstituted or transformed. And that transformation is occurring end-to-end, you start with devices, the entire memory system start changing and then you go into the cloud and the core network side, there is fundamental shifts occurring there. Our ability to sort of keep pace with the needs of the entire ecosystem is a big differentiator, and you can see that in our continued momentum of 5G orders in the company. We are into -- in conversations with lead customers today, because of the fact that we have the entire 5G stack end-to-end. We don't have to look elsewhere, we can look inwards and provide the complete solution for the ecosystem.

KEYS-2018-Q4-2018-11-20,49,Answer,2018-11-20,4,2018,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, I just want to say as you said, people of the company should be happy. We just sent out a note that our employees have variable pay based on their performance, and they're receiving record of bonuses for this record performance during the last year, and there is nothing that makes me feel happier than to be able to share this success with all the employees that are working very hard. Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this up roughly four years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically two plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comps, and we're seeing it in automotive with ADAS, et cetera, and these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5, and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast The U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- there's many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you'll see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out to add more, but right now there is such a opportunity and a gold mine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we had promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job.",0.6977011,0.99

I think from a gross margin perspective, we do not see big differentiation as we look to the different geographies around the world. The biggest differentiator we see on the gross margin line is whether or not we're selling into an R&D lab for an R&D solution or selling into a manufacturing line once production has begun -- once volume production has begun. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of our 5G sales at this point are still in the R&D phase.

So just a couple of comments as it relates to subsegments within EISG. As Ron has already indicated with regard to automotive, we really believe that we're in the front end of a multiyear rollout of next-generation auto. And so we just don't see any reason to believe that the growth there is going to subside anytime soon. The 2 other segments and they are obviously semiconductor and general electronics. The general electronics business is really extraordinarily diverse set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macro economy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in our general electronics business. And lastly, semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row. We did put up really strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but orders in the fourth quarter, as we expected, were down in the fourth quarter.

And it -- yes, about six months to bring resources on board, but it's happening over multiple phases across multiple parts of our business. Last year, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we deployed the first global services sales organization within Keysight. So we've had our first year of having a focus sales organization. And as you heard from Ron's comments earlier, we delivered record high order growth during the year, 30% order growth in Q4, 22% growth for the entire year. So it is working. The other subtlety here is we're really putting a lot of focus across all of Keysight global sales on selling services, not just a dedicated sales team that sells value-added services. We put a lot of focus on upfront services sales. So that means when you sell a piece of equipment or a solution, we're selling more services upfront, and that's really helping us to drive growth now and over time, because a lot of this will be reoccurring. And then across the board, our services business for multivendor repair and cal is up, our remarketed equipment sales are up, and I think it's a direct result of us being successful with our organic services capability as well as deploying a sales organization that is capable of selling services.",,0.985

That is an explicit focus across the board, including automotive. One of the vehicles, no pun intended, we're using to find and capture new customers is putting customers solution centers, where the customers are located. A year ago, we opened up our solution center right outside Detroit. It's been very successful. We have regular interaction with both new and existing customers there. And just last month or back in October, I should say, we opened up another new center in Shanghai, China, and that complements our capabilities that exist today in Bochum, Germany, in the Bay Area and other locations.

We do -- we view ISG as a very valuable asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by two primary factors. The first is that the test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since the time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue for at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we've talked about in the past.

Now it's year over year, right?

They've selected us for their new 5G network emulation, the solution is going to help them validate all of their RF workflows as well as the higher layers of their protocol for 5G. We've got a great scalable solution that we announced earlier in the months going from sub-six gigahertz up to 28, 39 gigahertz and we will do a great job of transitioning our customers from pre-5G to 5G NR to whatever the final standards are.",,0.97

First of all, the dollars associated with the win will grow as the 5G program grows at Qualcomm and expands. Secondly, they are a big time leader in chipsets and that part of the ecosystem really plays the role of early adopter and frequently serves as a reference solution for device makers in other parts of the ecosystem. So I think we're going to get some downstream leverage. And perhaps most importantly, I think this is a really big milestone. It was about three years ago where Ron declared the growth initiatives for Keysight and one of which was we want to win in 5G. And I think this win at Qualcomm is tangible proof that we're on the right path. And I think we've established ourselves in a leadership position where we have been and we will continue to -- investing aggressively to win. We've got collaborations all around the world with the market makers that we're leveraging, and we're really well positioned to help our customers accelerate the commercialization of 5G.

First of all, what we have won here in 5G on the protocol solution, we did not win in 4G. So this is pure incremental growth to us and Keysight being focused. The way in which we did that was we wanted to bring together the capability of Keysight with the capability of Anite and the capability at AT4. Obviously we made those two acquisitions over the last few years and the solution that we put together was by joining the best of hardware and software into a complete solution from those three companies.

And if you look at the car of the future it's really all about electronic, it's all about connectivity, it's all about intelligence. So this really plays very strongly to our strengths. Now our capabilities allow us to enable this major transformation in the automotive ecosystem. We provide solution in multiple areas. So firstly, we do design validation and testing of the critical automotive electronic control bots or the ECU. Okay, second is the area of connectivity, we do solution for telematics where we provide ADS solutions such as radar target simulators, B2B connectivities.

I'll make some general comments about 5G and then maybe a little bit of insight about how we manage it internally. From a 5G perspective, we continue to see acceleration of the 5G standard. Most recently the 3GPP committee pulling up 5G NR by about six months, I'm sure you know about that. That has been kind of -- in turn it's got all the global operators and it's gearing up for large scale trials. Depending on where you are around the world, different spectrum is being utilized below six gigahertz, sometimes 28 gigahertz, maybe 39 gigahertz. So there's a lot of pressure on the chipset and the device companies from a manufacturing standpoint to be able to meet these new aggressive schedules. So that's why we've been working closely with our customers with all these collaborations and came up with this new 5G protocol R&D solution, it's scalable, cover all the global spectrum that's out there, requirements, and it's flexible enough to help people transition from wherever they're entering, this technology way, they could be pre-5G, 5G NR or eventually what the final specs will be.",,0.335
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,73,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Mike Gasparian,,"The other thing I'll just comment on, because the way we're structured is with the industry solution team, so Soon Chai really has a great handle on the automotive industry and energy industry. And buried within the Keysight structure we have centers of excellence. So we have -- I manage a center of excellence for high frequency measurements. I also manage one for digital and photonics. But for example, in the high frequency measurement area, that group will have expertise in millimeter wave technology, over the air testing techniques, and those centers of excellence as well as our technology leadership organization, our Keysight labs we will be able to apply that and basically provide that technology to any industry. So Soon Chai can draw on the centers of excellence from all around the company. A great example might be 77 gigahertz in automotive radar. The radar technology is primarily sitting in our high frequency measurement COE but it's accessible to and we work closely with Soon Chai's industry group focused on automotive.",,0.962

He's our worldwide sales manager. But there's a lot of different segments. Certainly if you capture a win with Qualcomm, they'll develop a reference test solution for R&D that will really get handed off downstream probably to device maker, which will then parlay into operators. Now operators depending on who they are around the world are going to have different types of conformance testing.

I think as you think about -- as you think about 5G moving forward, the nice thing about our portfolio is we really participate in the 5G ecosystem at multiple points, right all the way from pre-R&D with our ESOP tools as people are developing the chips and devices that they're going to operate in 5G -- chip components, chipset devices, base stations and then all of that is ultimately going to drive a dramatic increase in data traffic back through the data centers. And so there's an opportunity for not only our data center business and the core Keysight, but Ixia to benefit from the 5G transformation. So Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.",1.9850575,0.922
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,92,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Mike Gasparian,,"I'll just make a really quick comment. Even though the Qualcomm example that we've been talking about today is in fact legacy. As Ron pointed out earlier in the call, this was not a business opportunity we were able to pursue historically when 4G occurred. It was really the confluence of the Anite acquisition and the AT4 acquisition, they're bringing the protocol expertise into Keysight combined with our RF expertise has allowed us to have more of an end-to-end solution. With that I'll turn it over to Bethany to see if she's got any comments about Ixia.",,-0.008
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,93,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Bethany Mayer,,"Sure. Thanks Mike. So for Ixia, we also have a very strong opportunity in 5G as well. What we saw in the first quarter was strong wireless quarter for us and double digit sequential growth in wireless, primarily in Asia Pacific, that's where we saw it. But I would also comment that we do have several customers in other parts of the world looking at our products in 5G. And then I would also comment that Qualcomm is a customer of Ixia as well. So we do have some nice complementary capabilities across Ixia and Keysight as we and the entire industry move toward 5G.",,0.972

KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,95,Question,2017-06-06,2,2017,Stanley Kovler,Citigroup,"Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on sort of the 5G opportunity here. When you look at the prior cycles that you had on 3G and 4G, and understanding that now you start talking about a fuller solution. What I wanted to understand is, given the way that 5G looks like it will play out, at first it's going to start off as a fixed wireless solution and then dovetail into more devices or mobility type of deployment. In the past the peak cycle on 3G and 4G in terms of spending has lasted maybe two years. Should we think about a similar cycle for 5G or thinking more about like a three to five year cycle on 4G? And then I have a margin follow-up. Thank you.",,0.953
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,96,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Stan, again I'll make some initial comments and then hand it off to Mike. Again we think of these cycles as far longer than two or three years given that we really come in on the front end, as we sell into R&D solutions and that's more true today in 5G than it even was in prior generations. And so right now here we are, we still don't even have 5G standards developed yet and we have a very strong engagement in 5G. And so we do view these as far longer cycles than that. Certainly there's going to be a ramp as you start to look towards standards deployment either in - or standard definition either in '18 or early '19 and then commercial rollout in the early 2010 timeframe. But Mike, I will leave it to you to add any additional commentary.",0.3695402,0.944
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,97,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Mike Gasparian,,"Yes, just a quick clarification on the model that you threw out. First of all, I would agree with Neil's comment and maybe Mark wants to add something in here. I would view the peak 5G cycle as a much longer worldwide deployment than just two or three years. The second thing, and coming back to this worldwide dimension of the opportunity, fixed wireless is taking a very strong lead here in the U.S. with both Verizon and AT&T. But if you look in the international markets, in Asia in particular, most of the action is at sub-6 gigahertz, and with massive MIMO, as kind of a primary challenge. So if you look across the different 5G deployments, you see over-the-air challenges, beamforming challenges, massive MIMO, I mean this standard really is a -- it takes it up a step function on multiple dimensions, different frequencies and it just leads to a plethora of measurement opportunities for us to make contributions, right? It's largely uncharted territory whether it's sub-6 gigahertz with massive MIMO, or if it's a 28, 39 gigahertz millimeter wave opportunity, this is all new ground for our customers. Mark, do you have anything else to add?",,0.954
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,98,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Mike, I would just add to just build on what you just said, unlike 4G and certainly 3G, there's just such a larger breadth of opportunities that 5G is playing into. From the things that you mentioned to low power low latency IoT applications, medical applications, we talked about automotive and how these industries are colliding, it affects the backhaul of data centers. So it's more than just pushing more through a wireless pipe, it's more than just streaming Netflix. It's about a whole number of different use models that are first of all completely global, this is happening everywhere in the world. And it's touching all these different areas where Keysight is participating and being dominant. So it's definitely more than a couple three years. If you think back from 2G to 3G to 4G, that occurred over a 20, 30 year period. So I expect this to be longer than just that couple of years.",,0.657
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,99,Question,2017-06-06,2,2017,Stanley Kovler,Citigroup,"Thanks. If I could just follow up in terms of the gross margin outlook for next quarter, if you bake into the numbers, I'd land somewhere in the low 60s range if I'm correctly blending in the Ixia and Keysight margins. And so that puts me above the range of where you typically operated obviously. Could you just help us revisit how we should think about the gross margin line going forward? Typically you've gotten to these levels or near these levels at significantly higher revenue in the past? Thank you.",,-0.143

But let me make a couple of comments, that might help you. So first of all, you're correct. Obviously we're going to benefit from adding -- on the gross margin line we're going to benefit from the addition of Ixia. You are right, you're adding on an annualized basis approximately $500 million of incremental revenue that has gross margin in the very high 70s in terms of where Ixia operates. So that's going to be a net-adder to the Keysight who has traditionally operated in the high 50s.",0.8236827,0.637
KEYS-2017-Q2-2017-06-06,101,Answer,2017-06-06,2,2017,Neil P. Dougherty,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Now within Keysight's portfolio we have a wide range of margins generally speaking. Our sales into R&D -- our customers R&D labs come with a higher gross margin than sales into manufacturing. Certain product lines, we talked about semi today having a favorable mix benefit from a gross margin perspective. But I think if you look historically at Keysight's results we've operated in a pretty tight band, two to three percentage point band and Ixia has been operating in a similarly type band albeit roughly 20 points higher in total.

As for the sustainability, obviously we're benefiting somewhat, that we're at the very early stages of a ramp and so the numbers are still relatively small. But we certainly expect that 5G is going to continue to ramp aggressively. Now the growth rates are going to come down over time as the base goes up, but we're still at the very front end of a 5G ramp with -- still in a stage prior to standards developments, or standard definition.

Exactly when, I don't -- I can't -- I don't think it's completely modeled out nor would we share it at this point in time. But what I can say is our 4G sales I think feel like they're stabilizing.

And part of this has to do with some decisions that we made as a company seven years ago in China as we started to see the changing landscape there, which is shifting from a manufacturing focus to an R&D focus. So we've been engaging with local indigenous companies in China, multinational companies in China. There's a lot of leadership coming out of China today with a number of companies and we're very well positioned. The collaborations that Mike talked about before, the example that we provided today with Qualcomm is representative of a lot of the work that we're doing around the world. And China is high in place for that.

Just another comment along those lines, we've worked with Datong and they are the ones that sit on the standards bodies in China where that standards body for instance have to be -- you have to be from China to be on it.

I appreciate the opportunity to provide more details. So obviously the acquisition has been closed for a little over a month at this point, and that's a month that we've spent really working hard to solidify and define the integration plan that we're going to be putting in place over the course of the next nine to twelve months, and to make sure that the assumptions that we had made about where we could get cost synergies from the combination of the two companies that those assumptions were correct, and making sure that we still had line of sight to the $60 million. So again six weeks or seven weeks post close of the acquisition, very confident in our ability to ultimately get to that $60 million and as you noted we're pulling forward the timeline on how quickly we're going to be able to get the first $40 million.

And just as we're off and running on working on identifying the cost energy opportunities, we're similarly off and running on generating revenue synergies. As you know, we have communicated previously we really identified three areas where we expect to get revenue synergies. One is from leveraging the breadth and the international scope of Keysight's field to provide qualified leads to the Ixia team, and then there are some sub-segments of the market where that actually works the reverse direction, where Ixia's relative strengths are going to provide opportunities for Keysight.

Orders did moderate slightly on a sequential basis, and I know you have referred to it as largely seasonal, but maybe if you can share some insights on what you're seeing in terms of order trends outside of the normal seasonality? For example, in commercial communication, how would the order trends for the quarter?

So orders were very steady throughout the quarter. And actually, in certain areas, they trended to increase as we saw some of the COVID-related impact diminish. But we've seen continued investment in next-generation technologies with strong order growth in 5G. That's already been mentioned. Our high-speed digital and optical solutions to support our 400-gigabit data center expansion, customers around the world has been very strong. And the advanced semiconductor process technologies, including EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet. 5-nanometer continue to be very strong. And with semiconductor, in particular, we saw strength across all of the regions.",,0.984
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,34,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"So the other part that was up was aerospace defense for us in the U.S., and that was offset by some weakness in Europe. Principally due to the COVID effects and some mix conditions in Asia. The COVID impact, I would say, there was some disruption certainly across all regions, but Asia was least affected because they came out first. And on a relative basis, we saw a larger impact across Continental Europe, where many of the countries and economies started slowly restarting and reopening in late May and June.",,-0.009
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,35,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"So where do we see this impact? We saw it in general electronics, some of our indirect channels and in areas where government funding was redirected like in education and in research. And then the macro impact from automotive remains soft. But as Ron noted, EV and AV continues to be a very strong top priority for our customers for the industry, and we had several large new customer wins in the quarter.",,0.897
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,36,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"So what I would summarize this as, overall, there were COVID-19 headwinds, but our sales productivity and customer engagement remained very high. We delivered steady and improving orders throughout the quarter. Much of that was delivered by growth and demand from our solutions for 5G, 400-gig, next-generation semi. And we also delivered strong growth for services as customers relied on us to help support their operations and the adoption of KeysightCare continues to grow. And we built a strong funnel along the way as well. So Satish, I'll hand it back to you and you can make some further comments on commercial costs.",,0.991

But Neil, in calculating the implied operating margin of somewhere close to 27% in the fourth quarter based on your guidance and when I look at it on a sequential basis I think it's implying more of a 33% incremental margin. So I just wanted to check on that. It does sound a bit low. Particularly, it does imply your ramp up on the OpEx level that I wanted to check if that's really realistic given some of the changes you might have made in the cost structure as well as some of the temporary cost reductions you're benefiting from.",,0.226
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,39,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Neil P. Dougherty,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Yes. we typically see some -- even in a normal and -- Sorry about that. My mic is now on, so it's probably easier to hear me. We do typically see even as in a typical year as you migrate from Q3 to Q4, some uptick in expenses, some of that is related to the field as we get to the back half of the year and the push to finish the year strong. The 40% incremental is never intended to be something that is quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be quarters where we're above and quarters where we're below, but we're committed to over the medium to long term achieving that 40% incremental, which is something we've been able to do.

We saw order growth and revenue growth. And much like my comments earlier, we saw a steady flow of business throughout the quarter. Again, strength in 5G with some of the market leaders as well as increasingly selling to this longer tail of customers within the ecosystem, this is where we saw a lot of growth with high-speed digital and optical manufacturing, again, driven by this global demand from our data centers or the data center customers around the world, and China continued to invest in semiconductor capability.",,0.968
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,44,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"We saw some headwinds from COVID, mainly from other parts of the world as opposed to in China directly, some macroeconomic influence from automotive. We did see an impact in Q3 in aerospace and defense. As you may recall, there were some new regulations that were announced in May that were put into place in late June around military end-user customers. So, we saw a small effect because it was later in the quarter. We are starting to see some rebound in some of the markets that were early affected by COVID, like general electronics starting to show some signs of recovery.",,0.34
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,45,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"But outside the quarter, Ron referenced this earlier this week, there was a new regulation for Huawei and a broader entity list that was published. And this was describing some increased restrictions on the sale of products, which are manufactured outside of the U.S., but have U.S.-based technology or software as part of the development. So, this shift to tighter restrictions than the previous regulation will limit sales to Huawei and their affiliates. There were some additional announcements made on some additional affiliates added as well that don't have much of an impact.",,0.494

The one thing I will say, though, is that we faced adversity and challenges in China in the past, and we've been very effective at redirecting our focus and priorities and we're certainly looking at that as we continue to digest the information. So Neil, why don't I pass it to you, you can comment further on the FX.",,0.51
KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,47,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Neil P. Dougherty,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Yes, I just wanted to give some more specific quantification of the likely impact of this new Huawei news. So we had said previously, based on previous rounds of restrictions to Huawei that we expected Huawei to be a 1% to 2% customer. Year-to-date, they've actually been exceeding that. They're closer to double that rate with increased sales in Q1, which we talked about and then, again, here in the third quarter. As we look forward to next year, it does look like these new restrictions are pretty comprehensive. And so we expect Huawei to be a very small customer for us going forward, but again if you think about it from long term, we were already expecting them to be a 1% to 2% customer. So the headwinds are a little bit bigger next year, potentially up to 4%. But over the long term, it's a pretty minor adjustment from what we've been expecting.",,0.877

Again, as we move more and more to software-centric solutions. This fits in right with our strategy. And the way to think about this is a lot of our products or most of our products test hardware or test firmware within our customers' end products. This tests software, so we're finally using software to test software. And in particular, this is used to test user interface development. So when someone's developing new user interface, how do you know that it's effective and it will be something that can get customers through the interface and have a really good user experience.

So if you're referring to semi specifically, there's going to still be market constraints in the coming quarters.

Net-net, our long-term view and outlook remains unchanged, and we look at it both from deployments and actually the number of devices that are going to be manufactured this year. So pretty strong from that point of view. And we see that strength reflected in increasing demand for our R&D solutions, but also on a year-over-year basis, we had a very strong uptick for our manufacturing solutions.

We've had differentiated offerings. You're right in that a lot of the demand so far has been driven by the web scale companies into data centers, which we think will continue to accelerate and the industry is not done and awaiting. So there's more innovation on the 800-gig that's underway as well and a bulk of this opportunity from a production perspective is playing out in Asia, and we're capturing majority of the share on that front. And we'll continue to see that as the industry progresses to 5G and especially stand-alone use cases, more of the operator-based or metro-based versions of 400-gig play out.

KEYS-2020-Q3-2020-08-20,68,Answer,2020-08-20,3,2020,Satish Dhanasekaran,President-Communications Solutions Group,"Yes. I think the way to think about it, Mehdi, is we have a diverse portfolio in commercial communications. And on the wireline side, have a good breadth for solutions, both between R&D and production, and they sort feed each other. We start early with customers and follow that life cycle as they get into production and get back into deployments with operators. So it's that whole, let's say, solution franchise that we have that allows us to maintain a pretty steady business. And on the wireline side, in particular, the business has been a lot more steady and augmented by the addition of the layer two, layer three capabilities from the Ixia acquisition. So yes, right now, data centers is driving 400-gig demand. We expect then the telecom demand to pick up and then simultaneously 800-gig with the first instantiation being 100-gig serial-based will start, and that goes into production.

Maybe you can talk about how sustainable you think this level of EBIT margin may be certainly implied to be at the kind of levels again next quarter.

These are clearly not normal times nor do we expect next quarter to be normal times. We have a unique operating model that allows us to maintain profitability and cash flow generation in tough economic times. A key portion of that model is the variable pay component for 100% of our employees, the drivers there, organic growth and operating margin.

So again, over the longer term, we're committed to 26% to 27%. We're very pleased with the results we're getting in the short run.

As you know, or as we've said, it's a relatively small business. But as we report core growth numbers, relative to as reported, we would expect Eggplant to have about a 1-point impact on our growth rates.

So the business is actually holding up very well with strength in the U.S. And our own position with respect to electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and space and satellite is strong.

So, as Ron indicated, we're trying to focus on our investment on areas we'll drive growth with it while staying within the overall operating models. You're seeing a shift from other expense lines and in COGS into R&D and into the field at a macro level. I think the other impact, specific impact of the field compensation change is, you potentially see a more dramatic seasonality from costs lower in Q1 and Q3, and higher in Q2 and Q4. And there's really two things that are driving that. Obviously, we've increased the variability of our field compensation structures and our orders tend to be higher in those two quarters.

KEYS-2017-Q1-2017-02-16,80,Answer,2017-02-16,1,2017,"Neil P.

But of course, in a lot of cases that's not the best solution for the customer. So, it does come out in feature-rich boxes, but Neil has hit it right on the head.

And both of those markets, we saw really nice order growth in that area or in those areas during the last quarter on the order side. The third area is semiconductor. And semiconductor, when we look at parametric test, we have very high market share and we do a real good job of working on the leading-edge node technologies.

As what Ron mentioned, the two major driver for EISG really revolves around the automotive, power segment and also the semi segment. And for Q1, in fact, we see almost a double-digit growth for both of these segments from order perspective. Okay? And reflecting back to your question on automotive, we definitely see it as a growing segment. And this is, as you know, fueled by the increased electrification of cars.

No one knows what's going on in the economic situation but we do believe when you look at our growth rate that we're doing a very good job of gaining share and leading in positions such as 5G and Automotive. So that looks very good. I also will comment that with Ixia, although we had to invest a lot this past quarter to make sure that we had all the systems in place and consolidating 28 sites and absorptions of roles, I'm very encouraged to see the funnel start that we have in the beginning of this quarter.",1.0163793,0.98

I think if you look at the puts and takes, obviously there was a bit of an unfavorable mix shift with the relative weakness in ISG, obviously a strong gross margin business while at the same time we were seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we've emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. A core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter which was expected and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and share in the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside. At the same time we're investing to obviously continue to make sure we maintain the leadership position in core technologies around 5G and Automotive.",0.656051,0.986

And any change you could size the EPS effect relative to your guidance in the quarter?

KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,62,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, again just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get to the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular we moved Ixia on to Keysight Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we've set up over 90 different customers on brand new contracts which we had to negotiate one by one obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location where we moved contract manufacturers on top of that trade and logistics processes change. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We're also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a lot of technology sharing and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on in CSG. And we're at the beginning elements of that seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight technical conference, the biggest conference that we have, every two years and we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that.

On the positive side, we were expecting the shipment recovery from the fire disruption to carry into Q3. We were able to accelerate that and obviously pull those shipments into second quarter. That coupled with the order strength in the core, the third consecutive quarter of double digit order growth in the core, we're obviously net positive even relative to the guidance that we put out. On the flipside, Ixia, we had expected some softness and some slowing of the incoming order rate as a result of this significant integration effort but the ability to ramp sales back did take longer than expected, so there was some downside there relative to what was baked into our guidance.",1.4111175,0.676

The funnel was the highest that it's ever been inside of Keysight for the Ixia business and it's been - it's the highest looking back seven quarters and that's just as far as we've looked back.

Strong order results across all geographies and segments as we already know in the third quarter in a row of double digit core order growth. I see continued strengths in 5G across both wireless and networks especially picking up in the second half with some of the deployment from the network operators that have already been announced. Aerospace, defense is seasonally stronger for us in the second half and with the U.S. budget being signed, we're expecting to start seeing some of that funding flowing probably toward the fourth quarter for us. And then our growth strategy around Automotive and energy continues to yield great results six quarters in a row of double-digit order growth. As Ron mentioned in his opening comments, the Scienlab acquisition is really an important and strategic one for us as we move into other parts of the business, including the OEMs. So it really is broad based across all regions and it really is aligned with the focus we've put around our growth initiatives.",,0.983

KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,81,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Sure. This is Mark. So as I mentioned earlier, our growth initiative is really well on track, six consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth. And it's really being fueled by the investments being made and really the raise for autonomous driving, electric hybrid vehicles and connected cars. What we have announced too, we mentioned this at the Investor Day as well as over the last couple of quarters calls, that we're establishing automotive solution centers in several regions to help further strengthen our customer connectivity in our solution development. The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running and it's doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon and we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We've won some business already in Q2 and we expect to see that continue especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think in general we're seeing the continued strength. As far as the semiconductor, it really serves all industries. So it's hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano-positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general test and measurement products as well as services.

You touched on this briefly but I was hoping we can get a better differentiation or distinction if there is one to be made between the acceleration and the strength in the 5G cycle and then the optical cycle which I assume is somewhat adjacent but is also can be different given metro builds and timing and other builds going on in China. So I'm wondering if we can actually look at the optical communications as an area of double-digit growth separate to the 5G or whether you think about them in a combined way and how we could think about that on a product level across the different groups?,,0.952
KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,85,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Satish Dhanasekaran,President-Communications Solutions Group,"Yes, this is Satish here. I'll take this one, Joe. Very insightful in that 5G is not just a wireless technology. It's a new way of thinking about the end-to-end experience which is the way we think about how our solutions are offered. So obviously there's the frontend piece, the wireless piece and 5G with the standards that you're referencing and that has to work together and therefore having 400G type of technology rollout is crucial and we see that playing out both in date centers and in telecom markets. So specific to our business we've invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite and it takes a couple of years to start to rollout those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers and you're starting to see the success 10 straight quarters of double or triple digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we have obviously been well positioned with 100G. You probably - if you've followed us or heard us on earnings calls talk about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017 and since then 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that's in place. And we start to now see a buildup in 400G even this quarter with strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically and this is why we manage our portfolio with focusing on all these technology evolutions that gives us a pretty good diversity as things play out.",0.5762981,0.982

KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,87,Question,2018-05-30,2,2018,Joseph Wolf,Barclays,"Thank you. That was actually very helpful. I guess just another question. When you think about the order pattern in the aerospace and defense, I know that this has come up on a couple of last calls, just in terms of the order strength and I guess pent-up demand or the actual procurement cycles, at least our defense analyst is thinking about this as being upside in terms of a pent-up spending cycle and things coming in ahead of expectations. Is that part or how significant is that or how conservative do you think we should be as we think about that potential given the last three - I guess the strength over the last couple of quarters?",,0.923
KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,88,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Sure. I'll take that. This is Mark. So I think the budget being signed back in April has alleviated a bit of that pent-up demand. We had a strong quarter. Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth and that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year's budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really I think what I look at is the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world and especially in the U.S. to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work. So the strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors as the budget moves its way through that process, we'll start to see some of that upside occur again towards the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside the U.S. as well, again, around the same things; investments in solutions for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera. So I would say it's more about that than pent-up demand which I think has more sustainability to it over a longer period of time.",,0.934

As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels.

KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,94,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Satish Dhanasekaran,President-Communications Solutions Group,"Yes, a good question. I think as you have pointed out about - according to GSA, about 14 operators in 11 countries have made some type of announcements around 5G deployments starting 2018. So whether you believe it's late 2018 or early 2019, that's a pretty significant number. When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it's pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology, again, a trend that we saw and plan for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher value-added parts of the market, early R&D and our contributions are increasingly for software which should give us better margin profile and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us it's about offering our customers an advantage and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single stop shop now with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem and we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the lifecycle, you're correct that we're still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for the next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced.",0.3055886,0.968

With regard to our margins, we are committed to the 40% incremental. And although we could go higher than that, we want to make sure that we stay on the leading edge. That is the secret and the key to this business and we're going to continue to invest while providing the shareholders with the type of returns that we have discussed. There is no doubt that we more software is being entered into the mix of our products with higher gross margins, but then again we have services which are also ramping and we had a record quarter for services which have lower than average gross margins. But overall we're focused on the customers, making them successful, providing end-to-end solutions, a little bit more software in services and delivering a 40% incremental.

KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,97,Question,2018-05-30,2,2018,Farhan Ahmad,Credit Suisse,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great set of results. My first question is regarding the strong growth that you are seeing this year. If I look at the first two quarters, it is above 10% in the core business, excluding Ixia, which is far above what you have guided your long-term growth in the business to be. So in regards to cyclicality, is there a concern here that we might be getting overheated? And as we look into 2019, the growth may decelerate meaningfully from what might be tough compares.",0.8871443,0.964
KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,98,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"So this is Mark. No, there's really - there's no indication that we're seeing any sort of cycle. As Ron already mentioned, our funnel for our Ixia products is very strong. The same is true on the core products as well. So we're continuing to build momentum. And the exciting thing is now we're seeing growth in other parts of our business as well, including software and services. We introduced PathWave and we've gotten our first order for PathWave Analytics. That's a brand new platform. That didn't exist before Q2. So this is going into a new set of customers with contract manufacturers and ODMs and we're going to continue to build on that going forward. So I think the investment cycles that we're seeing with the early R&D and 5G with the early stages of what's happening with automotive as well as other technologies that are feeding into the connectivity across the world are going to continue to give us opportunities beyond FY '18.",,0.938
KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,99,Question,2018-05-30,2,2018,Farhan Ahmad,Credit Suisse,"Got it. And then specific to the services group, can you talk about what specifically is driving the strength there? Because I would imagine that that portion of the business is somewhat less variable. And we are seeing more than 10% growth in the first half of this year. So can you talk about why are we seeing the acceleration in the services in such a meaningful way?",0.9990186,0.828
KEYS-2018-Q2-2018-05-30,100,Answer,2018-05-30,2,2018,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Sure. I'll talk to about a few parts of it. Again, it was a record high quarter for us with services. And then if you look at the components of our services business, really all of them were up at the same time. Our calibration revenues were up. A lot of that growth was driven from our Liberty Calibration labs that was part of an acquisition that we had last year. So that's doing very well. Repair was up. Our professional services were up. And a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide start-up assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there's a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory and we're seeing continued demand from some of the same end user segments such as wireless for our remarketed solutions. The last thing I'll mention here too which is the strength that we're seeing today from the solutions and product sales should help us fuel services sales in the next year to two years. So that's also an encouraging part of having services growth now and then going into the future.",,0.983

Due to on-going trade concerns, we now expect this customer to be approximately 1% of revenue going forward, which represents a five point headwind in Q1 and a three point headwind in Q2 of 2020.

So first of all, let's start at the highest level where we are approaching 60% of R&D and other pre-deployment types of solutions with manufacturing being close to 40%. So that's roughly the split. We haven't given that split for other businesses but certainly in commercial comms which is being driven by 5G, that is probably more heavily skewed towards R&D at this point than the overall business.

We have also been very successful in implementing our software business model and our go-to-market strategy. So when we are selling software that's got a perpetual license, we sell support with that. We are now being successful with growing new business model offerings with time-based licenses. And we are always adding new features and capabilities, as an example that Ron talked about with PathWave 2020. So it's a combination of all those things.",,0.954

One is our design software or EDA design software. The second is application software that gives customers answers versus just lots of numbers. And the third is platforms.

On top of that, we provide all types of software updates and that's why we are very pleased to see our over $850 million worth of software. You couple that with our services business, our ARR or recurring revenue continues to increase, which is the one of the strategies of our company.

The discussion around the headwind in the first half of the year is reasonably consistent with what you had laid out. But I am curious when you look at the combination of Huawei and HiSilicon, do you expect the revenue of the combination to those one or two customers, however, you define them, do you expect the revenue to be up in fiscal 2020 versus 2019?",,0.318

And so we have a pretty significant headwind as it relates to that combination of customers.

But I am curious, in the past, historically, Keysight has had a very, very strong position on kind of the base station test side, manufacturing test within infrastructure.

Ron, you had made a comment around the aerospace, defense business and kind of noteworthy, the orders were there plus double digits, revenue was kind of mid single digits, but you made the comment that kind of more to come. But does the order, again I don't know what the shipping cycle would be on the orders, the double- digit orders.

And I have two questions and I will ask them at the same time so you can answer them whichever order you feel is best. On the Huawei status, there are some companies that have been putting in applications to the government about being able to still be able to sell to them in the future. I assume Keysight has done this. Did you get a response? Are you still in the waiting pattern of that? Or any feedback on that? Because I know that there are some companies who are getting positives, yes, they can continue to ship in the future? Or is it simply, it's not going to happen much? How should we think about that? And then my second question is on the orders that you gave, I mean they are positive, but there has been a meaningful deceleration from that. It seems like that there will also be maybe is it a one percentage point or two percentage point because of Huawei from that, but also the orders deceleration, is it mostly macro related or trade tensions or peaking of 5G R&D test equipment?

Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take the second part of that first and then we will let Satish handle the first part. So as we said on the order line, we saw a $40 million impact from Huawei within the quarter. So that's four points, roughly 4 points at the Keysight level, but a much greater level at either the CSG or commercial communications level, which is where that business is very heavily skewed.

First off, I guess, my condolences to those in the Keysight family that experienced loss in the Santa Rosa fire. Jumping into the questions, I guess, Neil, can you elaborate a little bit more on the half-year guidance? I can absolutely understand how fires disrupted seasonal trends and deliveries near-term. But I'm hoping for a little more detail on how this may impact seasonality in the back-half of the year or visibility in the back-half of the year?

Ron or Neil, could you perhaps bracket maybe what the core growth might look like first-half versus second-half of 2018? And the math - my math kind of suggest that maybe core growth is 3% or a little shy of that in the first-half. And then it seems like it would need to pick up in the second-half, but you're going to have tougher comps. So maybe you can just walk us through maybe the timing there?",,0.872

In other words, it sounds like the core order growth here heading into fiscal 2018 is stronger.

But again, I think, as what Mark has alluded to, even if we expect some moderation in semiconductor, we do have diversity in the semi portfolio to at least and navigate through for any major perturbation, so to say, because within the semi, we do have offering in the biometric, which is really very much focused on the next-generation process nodes.",,0.642

We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business.",0.075275,0.842

Could you perhaps maybe just kind of walk through a little bit of the operating leverage that we really saw in both Commercial Communication Solutions Group?

Q4 was a very favorable -- if you're looking sequentially -- Q4 was a very favorable gross margin quarter for us as we really significantly ramped production after the COVID disruptions of Q2 and Q3. And I think just the nature of us responding to immediate customer demand for urgent delivery, kind of shifted the mix in a favorable direction in the fourth quarter. I think what we saw in the first quarter was the return to more normalized mix. It aligns with kind of the quarters leading it up to Q4 as well as slightly lower volume.

If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance. Our Chinese salesforce was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts within the geography and we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of the type of results that we did do.

Certainly I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable, going forward. But we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters -- well, not the only impact, by far the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal drivers the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. That variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin and in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore higher revenue growth like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year. Our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So, as you saw we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect the sequential increases results in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. And since all of our non-executive employees are participants in that variable pay program, that increase is split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D, and SG&A. Specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. But again, important to note that the underlying investment level is stable and once we get past Q3, our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels.",0.7565142,0.836

At the highest level, I think we've stated its growth across all regions, for 5G and all parts of the ecosystem. So, it is broad and we see sort of four teams. Right? You look at the R&D investment cycle, there's new teams such as [indiscernible] and O-RAN that are capturing interest, manufacturing opportunities, scale as 5g deploys, and it's profitable manufacturing as we have talked about as select manufacturing strategy.

As we have really done very well with the wireline technology evolutions over the number of years and last year was a pretty strong year for 400-gig, I think we've referenced it on calls. And what we saw this quarter was a broader adaption of 400-gig technologies, still heavily driven by data center demand, which is adapting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale. We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long tail customers in Asia in particular and we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur, that more of that demand will start to shift in the telco or Metro opportunities. So, we're still on the frontend of that. I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D, which we expect to play out in in production in 18 to 24 months. So, we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced the full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business. As far as the software, I'll kick it off, and maybe Neil can make a comment. We see for our double-digit growth in software coming from our pathway design franchise and from the 5G solutions, which as we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them. We're also seeing renewals for subscription contracts become important to our 5G growth, which I think helps us with the ARR. I'll just pass it off to Neil.",0.21685,0.398

If my math is right, the implied second half EPS growth is relatively flattish to slightly higher, year-over-year, 5% or 10% or so. And yes, I understand the higher variable comp, which makes a lot of sense and is good news. But is there anything else besides the variable comp that you're trying to factor into the implied EPS growth guidance that you're discussing today? Thanks.",0.0390851,0.361

Not only do we have the highest revenue quarter we'd had by a pretty significant margin, we had significantly higher gross margins than we'd ever had previously. So, we are going to have a tough year-over-your comp in the fourth quarter that is going to factor into that ultimate equation as well.",0.6407064,0.954

My question was on the 5G order strength and the strength that the companies have seen within Millimeter Wave. Can you describe to what extent you're seeing some increased adaption of Millimeter Wave in different geographies and perhaps the opportunity for Millimeter Wave deployments to help your business in China? Thank you.,0.2787356,0.975
KEYS-2021-Q1-2021-02-18,85,Answer,2021-02-18,1,2021,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thank you. I think as we have referenced before, the Millimeter Wave opportunity is a long term one for us. We see a very steady increase in interest from our customers. At this point, heavily driven by the U.S. bans. You can think of 20 gigahertz to 40 gigahertz sort of spectrum. And with new spectrum coming online, the 66 gigahertz to 90 gigahertz range, I think that tends to sow the seeds for the runway. We're talking about China's 2022 Winter Olympics, we expect it to be a push with a showcase of Millimeter Wave. So those are clearly drivers. And then if you look even further out, you start thinking about some early research occurring the terahertz space. So again, this is a very long-term opportunity. Keysight's got a competitive differentiation. We have talked about this and we're well-positioned to address this. Currently, we're working with customers to solve some critical challenges in commercializing Millimeter Wave like in advanced beam management, peak higher data rates, 10 gigabits per second and above. It's a long term dynamic and we are well-positioned there.",,0.361

Again, record orders and given the comps from the favorable comms, we have for the next couple of quarters. We expect strong revenue performance in the business and our focus areas around defense modernization are also aligned with some of the strategic priorities of the governments around the world. So we feel good about where we are in the business. With regard to your question on wireline, the entire portfolio of wireline involves the focus in three areas if you think of it. The focus on high speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig, terahertz and terabit ethernet and beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest. And the third area is on visibility. Clearly, we're the drivers for the business right now are 400-gig and 800-gig. In terms of the visibility business, we expect or we're everything we hear and we see the pipeline building towards it is a recovery in enterprise IT span, which would be a good peg. And that to occur as folks return back to work or in a hybrid mode later on in the year. So that's probably a driver for that part of the business.

So, you can see we're very deliberate and we're very focused and we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is our first priority. The second thing if we had excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw on Q4, where average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase.

My first question is just around the full year guide. So, you're guiding the full year to 6% to 7% growth, and I'm just trying to flip that with your commentary last quarter around -- expectations around a more muted seasonality. First of all, does that expectation still stand true? And if so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal '21, or is there something I'm not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?",0.2779386,0.964

So, yes, as we mentioned on the call, we did see the supply chain situation tightened during the quarter, and our guidance does assume that we will see some relaxation in that environment in the back half of the year. So, if I was thinking about the seasonality for FY22, I'd say two things. I think, first of all, I think we'd expect revenue to build as we move throughout the year. And then, maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I'd be expecting growth rates in the first half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are slightly above that 6% to 7% level, so that we average that for the full year.",0.2333526,0.924

The business -- the demand for those products has been very strong. We've seen a very nice rebound this year in the automotive business, the semi business, we all have -- everybody has seen the press on the continued strength in semi. So, you take that strong demand picture and -- which essentially allowed them to leverage their OpEx infrastructure and drive really high levels of operating margin in the short run.

Neil, I wonder if you could just dig a little bit deeper into kind of some of the supply constraints that you're seeing out there. I think you said in your prepared comments, it's hitting you guys, EISG stronger than comms. I'm kind of curious, is this logistical constraints? Is it component constraints?

The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so, there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think, it's also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so, there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG.",0.3262884,0.945

And if you're starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I'd really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter, but over time you're looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There's typically a little bit of a lag at certain percentage of each quarter's order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and in 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so, I think we estimate that if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so, I think that's the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog, once the supply chain situation fixes itself.",0.6551824,0.273

As we stated before, the continuing deployments that are going on, especially in the low frequency bands across the world, we view it as a favorable dynamic, specifically the C-band auction was a near-term catalyst. And we've had some strong results, as I mentioned, double -- strong double-digit growth in 5G this quarter, capping off a double-digit growth in 5G for the full fiscal year.

And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think, in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So, I think those are additive, given everything that's happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so, I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we've communicated for next year is the new steady state, that is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, exactly where -- a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we're indicating for FY22.",0.1175287,0.938

Ron maybe the first question for you just on the 5G market and how it evolves over time. I think one of the investor concerns out there is that you are levered early to deployment of prototype 5G, but perhaps not as levered as you get to broader deployment of 5G. I'm wondering if you can help us understand how you think the market is going to evolve for 5G for you and as you answer the question can you talk a little bit about your share from 4G to5G and kind of what you've done to augment your TAM from 4G to 5G?",0.7824497,0.878

There is no doubt that our share is much higher than it was in 4G. In 4G, we did not have the funds to invest as heavily as we needed to in order to win in the protocol space.

I'll ask them both at the same time so you can answer them in any order and they are pretty straightforward. The first is with coronavirus, is the R&D cycle still lengthening or are people now adjusted to work from home and work remotely now where it's actually compressing. The reason why I ask is it seems like two months ago, was everything progressing slower and it now sounds like from your comments and other companies comments, things are kind of coming back. So I was just kind of wondering about the design cycle and then my second question is your inventory went up quite a bit, but you talked about supply chain issues. Was that simply not having all the right parts to put together your heavy equipment and your big calibration items in your test and measurement things or did some of your inventory like trapped in certain locations or you're missing just a couple of widgets that go into it and so you're like 98% of the box completed before it can ship.

I'll take them in reverse order. With regards to the inventory situation, it's real simple. We have parts coming in the door and we have no one in the factory to build them and that's the case that we had in the second half of March. It's not the case now as we have Penang up and running, but we also supply parts from our tech center in the United States.",0.6729885,0.579

One would expect perhaps that given access just globally is better to customers as hopefully they - everybody starts to return to work here and we got some of the access kinks maybe worked out a little bit in the fiscal second quarter, but typically, your orders are flat to a bit softer in the third quarter relative to the second, but again with improvements around access, would you expect to build backlog again in the third quarter given where you are and the disconnect between the production ramp and kind of what's going on the order and sales side?",,0.696

We didn't see any rush to the quarter because of the wildfires at all, but that never seemed to come up. None of our customers canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner.

They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there is while our semi business remain relatively strong, we really sell two main products into semiconductor: first is parametric test, which tends to be a little bit on the higher margin side; and then we sell some laser positioning systems that are still good margins but not quite up to parametric test levels.

You commented that commercial communications saw double-digit growth, reached the highest level since forming Keysight. But I'm curious if you could quantify that order growth rate a little more clearly.",,0.965

Are you inferring that future order growth rate is going to decelerate below that 5% to 7% growth rate, or is there a lag effect because you have more software content? You already talked about the military orders having kind of longer duration. And I believe that your 5G orders are also tied more to long-term R&D relationships.",,0.877

So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and our first-half guide implied 4% core revenue growth. So we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing a lengthening of our order-to-revenue conversion cycle.",,0.868

Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.",,"If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balances as we have increasing both in the software and services base orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solutions sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace, defense, as we sell more systems and there are installation and customer sign-off requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time.",,0.296
KEYS-2018-Q1-2018-03-01,68,Answer,2018-03-01,1,2018,"Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.",,"So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3 but maybe with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains.",,0.954

And then, Ron, I guess, nitpicking on kind of a negative. The overall business performed incredibly well, but the Ixia assets I think continue to underperform, whether it's related to growth targets in the proxy or consensus expectations prior to the acquisition. So can you help us understand whether the underperformance is all from the 100-gig slowdown in the core Layer 2, 3 test business, and how investors might think about that duration as 4G you already talked about is growing off of a small base? Or is this also visibility business that's seen some slowing growth as well because we've heard challenges from many of your competitors and I guess specifically on the visibility side, can you provide any revenue or order commentary?

So there's no doubt you did see some softness in 100G as you've seen in the competitor's results. We still had some overall solid growth, high-single-digit growth for ISG, which was nice to see. There's a lot of moving parts, as you know, when you pull the acquisition together. And on top of that, what we saw in the market situation that you've seen with our competitors, the public ones and the one that has recently gone private. But we're very pleased to see high-single-digit order growth right now. We're very pleased that we were able to integrate that. We're very pleased that we're on with our cost synergies.

We had growth in both orders and revenue in both test and visibility during the quarter. We saw a lot of increased activity in 400G where we're first to market. We're actually shipping a product.

Our customers are having to tool up for 5G. In many cases, it's platforms that have to be upgraded to new equipment, as Ron referenced. And for Keysight, we also are participating in more test insertions in 5G than we've ever done before. The acquisitions of Anite and now and most lately Ixia gave us additional capability to offer a more comprehensive solution to our customers.

Under the prior tax structure, we had access to about 25% of our cash in the U.S. With the move to the territorial-based system, we'd expect to have access to about 90-plus percent of our cash really anywhere that we want it. From a capital allocation standpoint, our number one priority continues to be the de-levering post the acquisition of Ixia. Obviously we added significant leverage to complete that transaction.

Obviously we've had - our revenues and shipments are a bit more volatile here in the first half than you would typically expect given what's going on with production.

We've talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously off of - with 4% in the first half, we'll be growing at better than that in the second half and focused on meeting that 40% incremental. We also from a margin perspective in the second half see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. So we have some that are in the run rate now but it was really this integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia.

The non-standalone version, we continue to see a lot of innovation occurring with 4G. And there's also automotive use cases coming in C-V2X and other new features along with IoT capabilities which will be first deployed on 4G. So I feel reasonably okay about where 4G is headed. But if you fast forward 10 years from now, maybe you will see the trend that you describe, but it's hard to see in the immediate near-term that there could be a complete turn off of 4G; although there are parts of the businesses that might be experiencing that.",,0.198

One thing I will say is that the breadth of 5G is very different than 4G. So we're seeing growth in the areas that you mentioned and over-the-air testing and millimeter wave. But on the on the EDGE, we're also seeing continued growth for 400G PAM-4 on the digital side. So I think that's going to combine to be a very different scenario than what we saw in 4G.",,0.693

This brings our revenue growth range for the year to 9% to 10%, which is above our prior outlook of 7% to 8%. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.20, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares.

KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,50,Question,2019-08-21,3,2019,John Marchetti,,"Thanks very much. Good evening guys. Just real quick on the upside in the quarter itself. I think on the last call you talked about the Huawei or the expectation of Huawei, being about a $25 million hit in the quarter. Just curious where that stands now. I know you said that in the guidance it is still a little less than you had thought, but how much of soft of that 25 million actually came through in the quarter? And as you have been going through some of your processes there and looking at what you can ship, how does that stand now in terms of what you are shipping today, versus maybe what you were shipping at least from a product perspective earlier in the year?",,0.619
KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,51,Answer,2019-08-21,3,2019,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, John. So, it's a couple of comments. So, first of all, as it relates to Q3, we ended up shipping about a little, you know approximately $10 million more to Huawei than we had originally drawn up when we were issuing the guidance three months ago. I think as we look forward, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do see a muting, if you will, of the risk in Q4 because we are able to ship a portion of our portfolio into Huawei. And so that impact is more muted than we had originally anticipated and we've reflected that in the guidance that we've provided to you for the fourth quarter.",0.9261494,0.361
KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,52,Answer,2019-08-21,3,2019,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think as we look forward, as we've mentioned, Huawei has historically been a 3% customer, approximately a 3% customer for us. They were significantly larger than that in the first half of last year and with 2020 hindsight, it's pretty clear that they were buying ahead in anticipation of trade tensions. I think - so they'll need to work through whatever incremental inventory they've built up. And so, I think as we look to next year, we would expect Huawei to be maybe a 1% or a 2% customer for us, therefore, resulting into 3-point to 4-point headwind for us in the first half of next year.",1.1767241,0.542

That was certainly a little bit of a drag this quarter. Just curious if you can share some color there about what areas seem to be weaker? Is it just a sense that the general economic outlook there has deteriorated? Or is there something more to it than that?

That's a pretty big number. And we saw that reflected in some of the R&D spend that was coming from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 players in the smartphone space.

So, with regards to ISG, there are two different businesses there. One is network visibility and the second is network test. Network test sits right in the communications workflow and is very much connected to what happens in CSG. Network visibility is a little bit further down the line and therefore is able to get going without the integration directly.

The network test business, which is in a tough market right now really needs to play out in our next phase of our original vision. Our original vision was to provide solutions across the total communications ecosystem end-to-end and up and down the stack.

And there is much more opportunities on the product synergy area as we go forward. The second area is the sales synergy. I'll let Mark talk to that.

This product synergy is going to be amplified by the changes that we're making to reorganization and sales, which is a continuation of the transformation that we've been doing for the last three years, further scaling our footprint across all of our global markets. Leveraging these really deep account relationships and access that we've built over years and decades into some of the same customer base.

And I will ask both my questions at the same time, so you can sort out about answering the order of them. But on 5G, I believe a previous person asked, what was the order rate for 5G. And I can't remember if you actually said the percent, or if you just kind of talked in generalities. And with the 5G orders versus 4G orders, since a lot of hardware can be upgradable via software, base stations can be upgraded that are 4G into 5G via software, is it the same true about a tester? Can a tester be upgraded from 4G to 5G, or needs a completely new tester? So, just kind of a little bit more on the 5G orders and testers.",1.2147298,0.687
KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,105,Question,2019-08-21,3,2019,Jim Suva,Citigroup,"And then my second question is on the acquisition you mentioned. Can you explain exactly kind of what they do and how magnitude wise, they fit into your sales outlook for this year? Are they meaningfully contributing in sales this year? And what about a full run rate, and why this acquisition should make sense, as compared to say, Ixia, which has had some challenges?",,0.73
KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,106,Answer,2019-08-21,3,2019,Satish Dhanasekaran,President-Communications Solutions Group,"Okay. Well, thank you. I think the first thing is our - our 5G momentum continues, as we have said before. Our commercial communications, you can look at the - the segment growth rates have been double digit as Ron has mentioned. And we continue to do well across the - across the entire ecosystem in 5G and it's still very early days. With regard to the upgrade question that you had, for most of the test tools that we are talking about, 5G represents a complete change, higher frequencies, wider bandwidth, which means the physical equipment is different.",,0.848
KEYS-2019-Q3-2019-08-21,107,Answer,2019-08-21,3,2019,Satish Dhanasekaran,President-Communications Solutions Group,"And then even in the protocol stack, the diversity between the non-stand-alone and stand-alone that we talked about also represents a pretty big opportunity for us, not only for a test equipment replacement, but also a continuous software mix changes and you'll start to see our - that reflected in our margin profile as software becomes a bigger part of our business. So, that's the other piece. With regard to Prisma, we're very pleased with the acquisition because we have been engaging very closely with a number of the base stations and small cell equipment designers, especially in the software layers of test and Prisma brings the expertise and the installed base with that customer set that allows us to build on the strength of our 5G platform. And I'll let Neil make some comments on the materiality of Prisma.",2.2976615,0.948

So Prisma, as I said is substantially less than 2% of revenue, think of it as closer to 1%. We're obviously baking into our forecast that level of revenue. So, it's a relatively small impact. It's a profitable business. But we're excited for what they bring both in terms of the talent of the people that we brought onboard and being able to bring on a technology that's additive to our 5G portfolio.",,0.796

And that is that we're seeing a strong demand and growth for our services. As a part of this business and overall, we saw double-digit order growth in services in Q3. And if you think about the expansive nature of these solutions and the complexity associated with them, we're selling more and more professional services.

Baird,"Ron, could we just speak for just a second or two, we're talking about Huawei and trying to get our arms around the situation kind of going forward, what has changed here? Is the fact that we're able to ship more. Is this part of the licensing process, or is this a definitional adjustment as to what's characterized to be affected by the restricted list? Because again, the Commerce Department just put out 44 new Huawei entities that were just added to the restricted list. And I'm trying to maybe figure out a little bit of what's changed here on a go-forward basis, because you seem to be including Huawei orders in your order growth rate. So, presumably, there is an assumption that you'll be able to ship those in 12 months. Good luck there, but...",,0.47

With regard to understanding what products we can ship and where they are, that was a moving target and it changed a couple of times. And we've sorted that out and we're very confident in what - not only what we did do, but in what we believe we can do if the regulations stay as they are. The new list that was just put out mentioning new entities, we've also looked at that and that's also in our guidance. So, I'll let Mark talk about that.",,0.44

It's changing, as you just pointed out, most recently in the last few days. So, we're focusing on this. We're complying fully with all of the export regulations. And as we pointed out in following those, we were able to ship some products and some more products than we originally had thought when we guided Q3. But I don't want to lose sight of the broader China situation. We have a very strong and broad business in China. And it's a very important market for us.",,0.717

And so, we've got a very strong position there. Matter of fact, when you exclude Huawei during Q3, we still deliver double-digit order growth for the quarter. So, yes, Huawei is built into our assumptions. We're looking at it very closely, but there is a broader story there that's very strong.",,0.917

Around the CSG business, the margins have just been fantastic year-to-date, both gross and operating margin. The incrementals coming in, might just well be 100%.

We definitely are seeing as part of our 5G portfolio a significantly higher software content than in prior generations. You took the words out of my mouth. If you're going to point to a single driver, that is the biggest driver of the margin improvement. You coupled that with the fact that we have a highly differentiated portfolio and an early lead to see the advantage of being a first mover in the marketplace, but certainly, that the software - the software component or the software portion of 5G is higher.

So, there's a lot of competitors in China, and we are continuing to focus on delivering value as we've just been speaking about. So, when it comes to the highly differentiated solutions and our global connection across these ecosystems, we have a very clear differentiation. So, I think we're winning a lot of that business. There is some lower-end commoditized business, including some companies that are based in China, that we're seeing an increased activity level as you might imagine because of the trade situation.

Our Commercial Communications group had a record revenue this quarter and second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and a large part of these results were driven by strength in both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, specifically from a trend perspective, 5G and 400-gig were big drivers of growth for us.

You look at the standards-based test cases that we offer and you can see that we're leading and that we are staying on the cutting edge and that's what our customers appreciate. So on the edges, we don't see any material change to our competitive position with regard to these advanced technologies and we have continued to invest this year in R&D to keep our differentiation strong. So that's the point I'll make. With regard to how this is all playing out, you might say, if you just think of the smartphone use case, there is about 7,200 band combinations in 5G that have been defined and to-date only 1,500 of them are being tested. So the latest devices that we have account for 1,500.

Just when we think about the year-over-year compares on both revenue and orders to the fiscal first quarter guidance, can you just remind us how much of a headwind Huawei should represent fiscal first quarter to fiscal first quarter? And sticking on the China topic, I'm just curious, when you think about the 5G strength, how important has China been over the last several quarters? More importantly, as you look into the first half of the year, what are you expecting from China?

I think the most important comment with regard to Huawei is, the situation with Huawei is not going to change our expectations as it relates to our long-term growth outlooks for our business or for our markets. We're entering the year in a very strong backlog position and I think that strong backlog position is going to enable us to essentially mitigate the impact of any short-term perturbations that may happen on the order line because of the year-over-year Huawei compares. We have an extraordinarily diverse base of customers around the world driving demand in our end markets and we're looking at that and the strengthening we've seen over the past couple of quarters relative to where we were in Q2 and we're going to keep our foot on the gas relative to those long-term targets.",0.3413434,0.946

So the business -- our orders in China in Q4 were strong and steady throughout the quarter despite some decline, obviously, impact from Huawei, that came from strengths in 5G and it is extending across the ecosystem as we scale those solutions. As Satish talked about 400-gig is hot, high-speed digital and optical manufacturing. So it's a very broad industry for us. We've also seen the economic recovery in China. They recovered first and more quickly and we've seen that show up in our automotive order growth and general electronics. And the bottom line is, as Neil mentioned, our business in China is -- we have a very broad footprint, the business is strong.

I think if you look at -- what you saw in Q4 was pretty much a reduction in the rate of growth of that backlog. We built very significant backlog in Q2 and Q3, as I previously referenced, abnormal levels of backlog because shipments were depressed because of the factory shutdown and re-ramp in Q3, while our book-to-bill was over 1, it was just a tick over 1, right?

So first of all, obviously, we've made a commitment to at least at a minimum be anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and we will continue to do that. But just as you saw with us in Q4, and frankly, over the course of FY 2020, we will be opportunistic when those approach.

We did say in our prepared remarks that we expect in FY 2021 our share count to be 188 million shares, which is flat. So that's our base case we're modeling. When I think about capital -- priorities for capital beyond share repurchase, we continue to have an active M&A funnel development process. We continue to look for ways to put money to work through M&A and assets that are accretive to growth, accretive to gross margin, much like the acquisition that we did of Eggplant at the end of last quarter.

I would say that we had a very strong year for the semi-business. And it's been driven by the growth in the 5G devices, and the high performance computing needs that have proliferated, especially due to folks working remotely and working from home environment. And we've also captured and capitalized on the China IC spend; our position in that -- in the semi business is highly differentiated, and we continue to track the node sizes from 7 to 5, and now a new activity is starting for 3 nanometers; so we're highly differentiated there.

We see continued investments in China, as well as other parts around the world, including the United States with the chips program that was announced several months ago.

We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making on gross margin. And really, there is a lot that goes into that. First of all, I'd start with software content, right. During this year, our software business continued to grow -- outgrow the broader company, until we continue to see nice growth in software and we continue to make great progress in the conversion of the way our customers buy software from us towards more time-based purchasing; so we've actually saw our annualized recurring revenue grow in the high-teens during FY '20, so that's helpful. We're making great progress; I talked about this last quarter in our services margin portfolio, that's a below average gross margin business for us.

As we migrate to those complete solutions, they tend to be more highly differentiated, and we can monetize that differentiation.

So just to reiterate a couple of the points that were made at the -- in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the tariffs that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial.

But even in China, what we're doing is we're redeploying some of our sales force to focus where there is business. So we dynamically allocate our resources to optimize our overall China business inside and outside of aerospace, defense, and we're capitalizing on the U.S. and our friendly neighbors that are increasing the aerospace, defense budgets.

KEYS-2018-Q3-2018-08-21,74,Answer,2018-08-21,3,2018,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, well I think it's a mix. The first thing that we did when we were reforming the company even before we went public was to identify where are the growth opportunities and what's the resources, where there is strength in the markets. And accordingly we focused on 5G, we focused on automotive and energy, we also focused on building out our services business and the list goes on. So I think we done a good job of picking the markets that actually have a higher secular growth rate relative to the other broader electronic measurement markets. On top of that, from what we can see, we believe very strongly that we are gaining share with our 11% organic revenue growth this year and much, much higher when you look at our total revenue growth. So we also, if you take a look at the core growth that we've reported versus some of the other players, I think our core growth really shows the underlying strength of the business. So Brandan, it is a mix of the two. The markets are strong, but we have taken Keysight to a point where we are outgrowing the market without a doubt compared to a time when we were with adjuvant where we were not. And the investments that we put in place are providing great returns all the way to the bottom line.",0.1333333,0.986

And then really, I think, maybe little bit early to start talking about fiscal '19 at this point, but any preliminary views you can sort of share with us in terms of how you're thinking about the topline growth next year? I mean on one hand, you'll be lapping tougher comps, but you should be lapping the easier comps of the Ixia business, some of that continues to sort of rebound on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I mean, how do we think about fiscal '19 relative to your longer term model of 4% to 5%. Is it reasonable that that might be a little bit better than the long term model? Thank you.",,0.974

Obviously we're very pleased with the high level of growth that we put up this year, 11% core growth for the year. And as you mentioned, that is going to approve present some stronger comps for us as we go into in FY '19. As we look at that though, we are still seeing continued strength in many of our end markets, 5G, automotive services, software, are all areas that continue to put up strong numbers. We've mentioned some of the areas that we're monitoring, being the China trade situation, the continued strength in SEMI that feels like it has to cool off at some point. We're not seeing that as of where we are today.

Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is no doubt that software is used more and more in many of the applications that we address.

So as that data comes off, software is the only way to analyze that. We do some of that software within chips or in firmware or in pure software. But if I take a look at the overall business, in FY'17, it was over $500 million in software. Now as we look in this year, this quarter we're running, obviously, significantly above that. And that's even without Ixia. And when we add Ixia software in and we're going to be doing -- adding that to our total number, but we just want to make sure that we breakout the products that are -- let's say, half hardware and half software and do that correctly. You'll see that number go up and up. But there is no doubt 5G drives software as well as many of our other applications.

As we have said before, millimeter wave is a long-term opportunity for Keysight. We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So, we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we are on the front-end of something that's going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term roadmap that's playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So, it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are.

Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity as well as some supply chain components shortages. However, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry we have an onsite fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We are very confident in the guide that we have.

KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,64,Question,2021-05-19,2,2021,David Ridley-Lane,,"Good afternoon. So, I definitely heard you on Keysight having its own supply chain under control. Other companies may be struggling a lot more than you and placing orders ahead of time, trying to make sure that they get the equipment that they need. So I'm wondering, are you seeing anecdotally any sign of pull forward on orders or maybe companies placing the order earlier that would have influenced your strong order growth this quarter?",,0.318
KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,65,Answer,2021-05-19,2,2021,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Yes, this is Mark. No, we really didn't see any evidence of that. What we saw was some - a little bit of pent-up demand from the impact of COVID last year, which we kind of expected it to somewhat offset the trade headwinds that we talked about earlier. We watch cancellations very closely. They were at a record low for the quarter, and we're seeing, again, this steady, broad demand. So we have no signs thus far that there is any material pull-in of orders.",,0.8
KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,66,Answer,2021-05-19,2,2021,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"And David, if I could just add on. I like your characterization of the vertically integrated supply chain potentially making us a little bit less susceptible to some of the supply constraints than maybe others are facing. As I sit and look at it, the challenges with regard to movement control and social distancing do make it a challenge to add capacity during these times. And so I've talked about in the past, our seasonality being more muted at least through the first part of the year. I think those things are going to really serve to keep that kind of muted seasonality in place really through the end of this fiscal year.",,0.869

My question is, there is lots of talk about double ordering and double booking, maybe from other industries like automobiles or consumer electronics or PCs and such. Or are you building in some conservatism for some double ordering or customers that may be putting in a little more orders due to the semiconductor shortage. Just kind of, kind of see if you're building in a little bit of conservatism or simply in the test and measurement industry do companies just not double order due to the lead times in specialty configurations needed?",,0.318
KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,70,Answer,2021-05-19,2,2021,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Yes, Jim, this is Mark. As I said earlier, we do watch for this, and there is really no evidence. Our funnel is very strong now for many months as we continue to supply our solutions. The results, as you've seen, are very broad-based. And unlike other industries, as you point out, oftentimes, the planning associated with customers procuring some of our systems and solutions can go out many months. So, it really doesn't lend itself to that sort of double booking, if you will. If you look at semiconductors, one of our stronger segments, we see activities that are a year or more out in preparation for outfitting a new fab or growing capacity. So it makes it very difficult to see any sort of hedging or double booking. And as I said before, we really aren't seeing that occur thus far.",,0.721

And in particular, if you could talk a little more on the opportunity on the application layer side in light of some of these new deployments?",,0.94
KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,75,Answer,2021-05-19,2,2021,Ronald S. Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So the commercial comps front, again, was broad. It covered both the wireless and wireline, so it's 5G on the wireless side and 400 gig on the wireline side as well. We also saw some recovery in our network visibility business as enterprises are planning for return to work and thinking about what that IT infrastructure spend looks like. So those all looked favorable, so generally, a very positive dynamic. Specific to the application layer, we identified a few areas around the different end market verticals and new applications to focus on about a year ago, and that's paying rich dividends. On the new application front, it's the Open RAN, where it's an open virtualized network, bringing in new customers and more players into the ecosystem. So we had strong demand for our solutions that we launched in Q1 and - Quarter one. And on the new vertical side, we gained traction with a lot of the aerospace and defense companies that are looking to invest in the DoD's 5G program. So both those are going very well.

But you're right that the more frequency spectrum in a heterogeneous manner that gets deployed, the test intensity goes up. And if you think of a typical device maker or companies in the O-RAN space that are putting radio and CU components together and they have to do the testing, the amount of time they have to do the testing doesn't go up. And so essentially, some of the COVID restrictions, of social distancing and all that, essentially means that customers have - are looking at ramping up capacity for the future. But it's a steady demand that gives us confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. That's just one dimension of capacity.

And I would expect you continue to see balance as we look to invest in the future growth of our business. I think specifically as it relates to share repurchase, we've committed to at least being anti-dilutive with our buyback program.

KEYS-2021-Q2-2021-05-19,97,Answer,2021-05-19,2,2021,Mark Wallace,Senior Vice President-Worldwide Sales,"Yes. So let me take those questions. First of all, with regard to our free cash, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash penetration was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that's a great long-term trend. And there is one significant timing difference, which we've already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we've recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there'll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters, because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well.",,0.97

But as we've said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long-term, if you look at our business, the push that we have, again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers' R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you've seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid to upper 50s, and now we're in the mid-60s. And so I think we've got a lot of great momentum in that space.

Obviously, we continue to see our software business outpace the overall growth of Keysight in total. And over the past couple of years that growth has been significantly above our long-term model. And as we've talked about, we have a great ability to drive leverage - profit leverage from growth. I think, if I were to step back big picture and say what's driving our improved gross margins, it's the fact that, we have changed our approach to go-to-market to one that's focused on end industries, and industry segments and bringing complete high-value solutions into the marketplace.

We have really focused on operational excellence and we have a program that's in place across all 12,900 employees here at Keysight to improve operational excellence, which is part of our Keysight leadership model. But Neil has really hit the nail on the head. It's our differentiation, when our customers go ahead and they look at total solutions, which is not only the world's best hardware, but the best application and measurement IP and software as well as our services capability across a broad range of products, we bring solutions that cannot be brought to bear by many of our competitors.

Nersesian,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so let me take the first part of that, and I'll let Satish comment on the optical piece. With regard to the profitability in CSG, I just pointed two things that we had a tough compare from a profit perspective for Q3, because in the year ago quarter, we had $6 million of one-time favorable adjustment to our warranty reserve. And obviously, we'd see achieving the largest ever businesses. They've got the majority of that benefit. You also have seen some increased investment in sales in our sales force as we look to capture growth. So I think those are the two primary things. Revenue is down as well, but the primary drivers of the tough compare with a one-time a favorable year ago and increased investment in the field to capture growth.",0.245977,0.955

And what we are now projecting is that that growth is tapering off. We're engaged with leading transceiver companies on the 400G bring up, and that's still in early R&D phases.

What we're really seeing though is that many of the folks that we do business with on a regular basis; so now with equipment manufacturers, many of the providers, cloud providers as well, are very interested in working on the 400 gig opportunities for products rollout, as well as potentially even network rollout.

I think most notably, as Ron mentioned, we made the decision very early and the formation of Keysight to shift some of R&D investments to make sure we got a first mover advantage in 5G, and we're seeing that play out now. So we can't give you specific market share numbers. But sufficed to say, we believe we're running in the market. That being said, there's a number of very strong competitors in this space, and they're not going to sit by and seed to us.

So essentially the idea is that we can test for our customers all the way from Layer 1 in the stack, all of the protocols from that point all the way to Layer 7, using our solutions; so whether it's cellular or whether it's Wi-Fi, we are capable of testing a full protocol stack across all layers and all spectrums. I mean that's pretty compelling. And I would say that that is certainly one that was driven in part by customer interest.

Again, that is a customer driven in a certain sense, but also company driven as well, because we can see the real value opportunity between our wireless test load products and some of the capabilities that, on the radio side, that we see in CSG.

And then the other activities, the other three activities; are really around work in the sales force; ensuring that we can gain the scale of the Keysight sales force across the Ixia product portfolio; working with John Page's team in the services aspects of our business.
