I am proud to speak to you today about excellent results in 2018 and the exciting outlook for the company in 2019 and beyond. As John said, let's start on slide four.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,5,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Before we start, I'd like to address today's announcement on our FDA application for Checkmate-227 in high TMB non-small cell lung cancer patients. As you saw in our press release, we have decided to voluntarily withdraw the application. This is because following recent discussions with the FDA, we believe it is important to further characterise the interaction between the two biomarkers of TMB and PD-L1 in these patients in order to understand their relevance to overall survival in this setting. To do this, we will need data from Part 1A of CheckMate-227 that will not be available during the review period for this application.",0.9612326,-0.273
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,6,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,I would like to emphasize that we continue to believe that TMB is scientifically important and we look forward to continuing to advance our research in this area.,0.5,0.511

I could not be prouder of our very strong performance for the quarter, which wraps up a very good year for the company. This was driven by excellent commercial execution on our priority brands and disciplined expense management that has driven improvement in our operating margin.",0.564281,0.897
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,8,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Commercial execution was strong across the portfolio with significant growth driven by our two key franchises, Opdivo and Eliquis. Our I-O franchise performed well throughout the year in highly competitive markets, and we have consistently demonstrated very strong launch capabilities.",0.5397614,0.92
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,9,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"During 2018, we saw very significant growth coming from Adjuvant melanoma and First-Line RCC in the U.S. And we are now working through the launch process in Europe having received approval for First-Line RCC in that market. Charlie will talk more about Opdivo a little later, and I will tell you that based on this strong momentum in the 18 business we expect to see growth for Opdivo in the U.S. and internationally in 2019.",1.3595096,0.93
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,10,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Turning to Eliquis, we continue to see robust trends with Eliquis as the established number one NOAC globally and the number one OAC in the U.S. As I've said before, we see considerable room for the market to expand with continued increased adoption based on the superior profile in atrial fibrillation that has made it a leader to date. Eliquis will continue to be a strong growth franchise for our company in 2019.",0.4102054,0.941
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,11,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to strong commercial performance, we have exercised disciplined expense management across our P&L, supporting significant earnings per share growth of 32%.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,12,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Our 2018 results and the approach that guided them provide a solid foundation for future success.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,13,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As I look back at our company's performance, I am pleased not just with our results from last year, but over the past several years. As I've said many times, I believe a key part of our success has been our ability to execute very well against a consistent strategy.",0.5586481,0.919
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,14,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me remind you of the key features of our strategy and explain why acquiring Celgene fits so well within that framework. Looking at Slide six, this is a slide you're very familiar with, because it's the strategy we've been executing for over 10 years. Central to our strategy is bringing together the best of biotech, namely innovation and agility with the best of pharma, the resources and scale to create a leading biopharma company.",1.7166998,0.942
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,15,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As I've said, this strategy has enabled us to be very successful over many years and has delivered strong performance. And I like to take a few minutes to explain what I mean by that.",1.7707091,0.872
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,16,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now to Slide seven, an important component of our strategy has been to ensure that we are constantly operating ahead of the curve. We took a very focused approach to creating the company we are today with an unwavering focus on science and innovation. We exited primary care and focused on specialty care and unmet medical needs. We designed a strategy to externally source innovation, to build our priority therapeutic areas.",1.8131213,0.968
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,17,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Importantly, the actions we've taken have led to innovations that have helped transform diseases like atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, melanoma and RCC, and resulted in strong earnings growth. The innovation cycle that led us to Eliquis, Opdivo and Yervoy has delivered for patients, and at the same time has also delivered financially.",1.5864811,0.785
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,18,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,We believe that now is the right time to move to the next exciting chapter of our company with the acquisition of Celgene.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,19,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Slide eight is a slide you've seen before, when we announced the acquisition of Celgene in early January. It provides an overview of how I am thinking about the combined company we will create, and I would like to call out the highlights.",0.9449967,0.557
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,20,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We will create a top five immuno science and inflammation franchise, with Orencia and Otezlathe and two near-term product launches. We will have the number one oncology franchise with leadership in haematology and a pipeline that would sustain that leadership for the long term, along with a growing solid tumor franchise with Opdivo and Yervoy.",1.0868125,0.44
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,21,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We are doubling our Phase I and II pipeline for many more possible new medicines. And we will gain platforms and capabilities important for scientific leadership in the future. None of this would be possible without the people of BMS and Celgene. We are creating a science leader, a leading scientific and innovation based company that we believe will be a destination for talent moving forward.",0.0056329,0.896
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,22,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Moving on to Slide nine, I want to explain how I view this transaction from a financial perspective.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,23,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I believe, the combined company provides value to shareholders through a robust and complementary marketed medicines portfolio. The near-term launch of six new medicines, the doubling of our pipeline assets and the opportunities for synergies. The strong cash flow of the two companies would allow us to delever our balance sheet and strengthen our credit profile within two to three years, enabling a stronger balance sheet and increased flexibility.",1.3909874,0.969
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,24,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"As we modelled the combined company, I see sales and earnings growth now through 2025. Overall, I believe that the combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene will create a company that will be well-positioned for the second half of the next decade, better than each company alone.",0.9307488,0.681
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,25,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Now let me turn it over to Charlie to walk you through our financials in more detail.,0.5324718,0.0
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,26,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations",Thank you Giovanni and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. We believe this transaction will bring significant financial benefits to shareholders of both companies with three defined sources of value.,0.5617811,0.881
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,27,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations",First is the value from the in-line portfolio of marketed products. This includes Revlimid which I know many of you have questions that I'll try to address in upcoming slides. The second source of value are the cost synergies of approximately two and a half billion that can only be achieved by combining the operations of the two great companies.,0.3833024,0.836
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,29,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Turning to Slide 11, when you look at the combined company on a pro forma basis, we see a stronger, more diversified set of opportunities that will enable us to drive growth, both on the top, and bottom line through 2025.",1.3643785,0.823
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,30,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","We see complementarity in the combined portfolio with near-term growth, driven mainly by the Celgene assets and subsequent growth driven mainly by BMS assets, particularly from I-O. This speaks to the strength of our in-line businesses, the short term growth potential from launches of new medicines, together with lifecycle opportunities from our I-O portfolio and a stronger late stage pipeline. The combination results in a much more balanced company, better positioned for the latter end of the next decade.",0.7302412,0.963
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,31,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","As we move to slide 12, the combined company will generate substantial cash flow that will allow us to reduce debt to quickly delever our balance sheet and strengthen our credit profile, while always subject to board approval, we have modelled continued dividend increases as well. So when I step back and think about the broad financial benefits of this transaction, I see a definitive path for value creation. The company that has significant growth potential over multiple periods and in a few years a reset balance sheet that allows us to complement our stronger internal R&D efforts, with a continued sourcing of external innovation from business development.",0.5424861,0.972
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,32,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Quickly on Slide 13, we've outlined a few assumptions in our models with respect to Revlimid and how we accounted for the pipeline assets. From an accounting perspective, we will include the Celgene stock based compensation in our non-GAAP P&L.",0.070872,0.586
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,33,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Now let me spend a minute discussing how we think about Revlimid and the outlook of our I-O franchise, since I know many of you had questions on each of those. Turning to Revlimid on slide 14. It's important to know that we performed extensive due diligence on the Revlimid IP situation, both independently and as part of the diligence process with Celgene.",0.4723562,0.202
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,34,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","We also had the opportunity to review confidentially the Celgene Nacho settlement and its impact on various litigation outcomes. With that in mind, we considered two bookend scenarios for Revlimid, one in which there is an early at risk launch, and another that is reflective of sell side consensus representing gradual erosion starting in 2022.",0.3955473,-0.026
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,35,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","We believe both of these scenarios have a very low probability. In between these bookends, our several other litigation outcomes or potential settlements that could play out and in our view each are likely to have somewhat comparable implications on the Revlimid revenues in the near-term.",0.4998145,-0.201
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,36,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations",Our analysis assumes a more conservative approach than sell side consensus and results in lower sales between 2022 and 2026. Through any of these scenarios we see the combined company generating significant cash flows that will enable us to delever while delivering returns for our shareholders.,0.8211503,-0.103
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,37,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Now moving beyond Revlimid and the combination with Celgene, let me turn to page 15 and our I-O business going forward. As we think about the combined business, we continue to see Opdivo as a key growth pillar. But let me take a few minutes to lay out the opportunities ahead of us.",0.4133581,0.637
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,38,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","We've demonstrated excellent launch execution and have driven growth through a broad set of new indications. Two launches that exemplify this high level of performance, our Adjuvant Melanoma and First-Line RCC in the U.S. Even with today's announcement, we still see Opdivo growing in the U.S. this year as our teams are well resourced to drive performance across key indications. As we think about our ex-U.S. business, while the dynamics are a bit different, we see growth there given the new launches in Adjuvant Melanoma and first-line renal.",0.5261596,0.915
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,39,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Turning to the long term growth outlook for I-O, as I mentioned, for our clinical stage opportunities, we risk adjust the revenue potential. Given the breadth of opportunities, you can see on this slide, we see significant growth potential for Opdivo with the growth trajectory be determined by the cadence of new indications. Naturally for 2020, the growth outlook will depend on the data we see this year in lung and in other tumors. Now I'm going to hand it over to Chris who will share his view on this six phase III assets that we'll be launching over the next few years.",0.9821892,0.967

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,41,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Three of these products are substantially de-risked, because the pivotal data are known or regulatory filings are well advanced, and the majority of these products are either first or best-in-class providing a meaningful opportunity to help patients across a number of disease areas.",1.3769634,0.881
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,42,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"To put this potential set of launches into context, I want to provide you with some background as to why we are excited by them and why they give us the basis for sustained leadership in key therapeutic areas moving forward. In INI we will be moving from being two companies each with a single product to one INI franchise delivering Orencia and Otezla right away with the potential of adding ozanimod and TYK2 in the near future.",0.8657442,0.402
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,43,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And in haematology, we see for assets that form the first step to building on the current capabilities that Celgene brings with this Revlimid business today to establishing sustained leadership in this space. We view these near-term launches as exciting opportunities and key drivers of value in the combined company. And I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these six up upcoming launches in more detail.",0.5486163,0.886
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,44,Remarks,2019-01-24,4,2018,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Let me start with Luspatercept on slide 17. A very exciting compound from our perspective which is a potential first-in-class Erythroid Maturation Agent to address chronic anemias. As you may know, chronic anemias present a serious, unmet medical need across various indications and Luspatercept is a compelling new mechanism for treating these patients.",0.1892296,0.624

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,The data presented at ASH have demonstrated that Luspatercept provides very good efficacy in MDS patients that have failed EPO as well as beta-thalassemia. These are populations with very few treatment options today beyond often chronic blood transfusions and these data are expected to be filed with the FDA soon.,1.4951384,0.248

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Beyond these indications, important lifecycle management trials are already underway including in the much larger first line in the U.S. population where Luspatercept will be tested head-to-head versus EPO.

In regard to your first part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments we have model dividend increases throughout the planning period always subject to Board approval of course.

Let me talk a little bit about how we see CAR-T evolving and the important role that the two agents we talked about will play in terms of potentially expanding the opportunity for CAR-Ts generally. You're absolutely correct that existing CAR-T therapies have struggled a bit both with respect to logistics in the hospital as well as with respect to access in large part because of the profile of these drugs. As you know existing CAR-Ts are administered in the hospital setting. Today patients must remain in the hospital often in the ICU for treatment as well as monitoring.",1.0725505,0.958

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"That said, anything you could do to potentially move these agents into an outpatient setting would do a number of things. Would bring the overall cost of these therapies down, it would increase the value of these assets. And importantly as I mentioned in the prepared remarks it would be an opportunity to expand the physician base who are using these agents outside of a large academic centers to potentially community centers and then ultimately expand the patient pool considered eligible for these therapies, and that's a potentially important opportunity that we see with the differentiated profile particularly of liso-cell.",0.6780105,0.958
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,89,Answer,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With respect to your second question, my perspective is that as we've said many times we have multiple opportunities to play a role in lung cancer. I think we need to see the data readout to understand the data. And as you mentioned Study 1a, Part 2 and 9LA are all important components of our lung cancer program. We've communicated before our expectations with respect to the timing of those programs and there is really no change there. But more importantly as Charlie mentioned when we think about the Opdivo business this is a growing franchise. And you've seen on one of the slides we presented today, the breadth of opportunities that we have over the next few years with over 20 registrational trials ongoing.",0.5970842,0.681
BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,90,Answer,2019-01-24,4,2018,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,There are clearly a number of opportunities in lung cancer this year. We have an exciting and very broad adjuvant program to drive growth in the medium and the long term. And I would say that with any franchise the growth expectations in the short-term depend on the data readouts that are coming in the next few months and that's true for us as well. But my confidence is that this is a growing franchise with multiple opportunities for growth and this is what we've modeled as we thought about the total company.,0.8074884,0.967

I guess my first question was just going back to slide 11 and that pro forma look at the company, I guess investor are trying to get their hands on the growth of the non-Revlimid portion of the pro forma company. Is there any color you can provide as we look out to 2025, what percent of that pro forma company sales and net income is coming from the non-Revlimid business, so just kind of think about the growth of that piece of the business separated from Revlimid?",0.7445632,0.904

I think you mentioned that Revlimid is modeled more conservatively relative to consensus. Is there any more color you can give on those assumptions, I guess specifically how much of a delta versus the street are you thinking about? And is that delta particularly pronounced in certain years over the planning period relative to the other years in that planning period? Thanks so much.",0.084777,0.683

So, couple of things about renal cell. First, we are extremely happy that Opdivo, Yervoy has become the Standard of Care in many settings in the United States. And also very happy that just recently we received our full approval in Europe as well. So we look at that is a great endorsement of the value this combination provides.

And I think that's one most important thing to keep in mind that durability of response can play a very important role. And so we look forward to seeing that data emerge and the comparative data sets emerge over time. But also remember that one of the other key things is we also believe that there may be a role for TKIs with IO and we have our study 9ER which will be reading out with Cabo and Opdivo as well looking at that, and that's a little bit later in the timeframe, later this year.

First of all, as Tom will describe the issue that is important really is the interaction between various biomarkers. I think we've been very clear since October that this was a complex file. You've mentioned that the overall survival data we disclosed in October with this respect to low TMB patients and obviously we been in discussions with the FDA on these applications.

We've always said these are event driven trials and the timing is impacted by the evolution of events, but we continue to look forward to seeing the results of this study. It is a broad program and we would see the data. We believe that based on that program we have a real opportunity to play a role in lung cancer.

As you know these are inherently event driven phenomena and it's very difficult to be able to predict with exact precision when the events will occur that will trigger the ability to readout.

Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","The second part of your question regarding if 1a is positive how would we approach that from a regulatory standpoint? Giovanni made that really clear earlier when he said, you really have to see where the data takes us. So we have to look at the data, see what the data shows us. As you know we have not seen survival data from Part 1 of the study.

In the U.S. second-line lung share is holding around 30%. We continue to see the percentage of IO eligible patients decrease, but that's very much in line with what we expected and where we expected to be at the end of the year. We're holding leading shares in first-line metastatic melanoma as well as in second-line renal cell.

BMY-2018-Q4-2019-01-24,125,Answer,2019-01-24,4,2018,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,You'll recall that we drove rapid uptake in the U.S. in these indications in 2018. We still however see opportunities to continue to grow in first-line renal particularly in intermediate and poorest patients. We've got a great story to tell there in terms of the strength of our OS and as Tom mentioned on the previous call the durability of the data that we're seeing there. And we're also benefit from full-year sales in adjuvant melanoma in the U.S. and of course outside of the U.S. we're still very much in the early stages of the launch of both of those indications.

We did see an impact on higher rebates in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, and in Q3 rebates were around 185 million. They increased to 278 million in the fourth quarter.

On Revlimid, I think investors are struggling with the erosion curve beginning in 2022, and the pro forma model, and then the pricing environment longer term.

In December, we attended our first medical meeting as a combined company at the American Society of Hematology just a few weeks after we closed the Celgene transaction. Importantly, we saw very good data at ASH for our hematology pipeline including pivotal data for three products, which are potentially approaching launch and encouraging data from the early pipeline. I believe that this reinforces the opportunity we have to broaden the hematology portfolio and sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma.",0.5019881,0.893

I feel good about the earnings power and growth outlook for the company moving forward. I am encouraged by the financial strength of the company this year. We see significant non-GAAP EPS growth from this year into next year and we project continued non-GAAP EPS growth into 2022 though this will be moderated by the impact of generics on Revlimid.

Having benefited from working in this industry for over 20 years, I could not be more excited about the growth potential and earnings power of bringing these two companies together.

To start, the business continued to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter with 6% revenue growth on a pro forma basis.

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"From a U.S. demand perspective, we are seeing sequential low single-digit decline driven by the headwinds we've described in the past.

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,31,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now with respect to some key indications, we expect steady performance in our melanoma business driven by our leadership in both metastatic and adjuvant setting. In non-small cell lung cancer, the size of the eligible pool of second-line patients is leveling off at roughly one-third. In first-line RCC space, we continue to perform well where Opdivo-Yervoy remains the standard of care in intermediate and poor-risk patients and we've seen stabilization in this indication as well.",1.6020121,0.625
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,32,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Internationally, we've seen very strong commercial execution in all our key markets, resulting in encouraging growth in the brand.

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,33,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So stepping back, we continue to see 2020 as a transition year for Opdivo, with demand pressures in the U.S. and growth in our international business. More importantly, as we move into 2021, we believe we have a strong foundation for growth fueled by potential new indications including first-line lung.",0.5448692,0.807

In the fourth quarter, we saw continued strong sales growth of 19% globally due to increased demand in both AFib and VTE. In the U.S., we saw 18% sales growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year, despite increased discounts for the Medicare coverage gap.",1.1899396,0.881

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Eliquis continues to increase its share at the expense of Warfarin and an expanding NOAC class. As the class has expanded, we've seen Eliquis taking share at the expense of other NOACs.

This highlights the continued growth opportunity for the class and the brand.",1.2297787,0.926

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We are also very pleased with the growth of Eliquis internationally, where we have a leading share in a growing number of markets resulting in 21% sales growth in Q4 versus the same quarter last year. We continue to view this brand, which remains the number one NOAC globally as one positioned for significant future growth and continued opportunity for patients.",0.5742455,0.952
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,37,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We also see strong growth in our multiple myeloma franchise. As you will see on slide 13, Revlimid continued to grow in the fourth quarter, driven by triplet regimens and increased treatment duration increasing 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Pomalyst saw significant growth of 23% in Q4 versus last year on a pro forma basis, driven by increased demand and duration of therapy. We expect growth to continue across both brands due to increased adoption of the triplet regimens and increased duration of treatment.",1.9420523,0.95
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,38,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,I'll now turn to slide 14 and review our fourth quarter P&L. This was an unusual quarter for the company as a result of the close of the Celgene acquisition on November 20. Included on our reported P&L are the approximately six weeks of results from its legacy Celgene business post the transaction close.,0.6124748,0.0
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,39,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As it relates to the non-GAAP P&L, we now include the impact of stock-based compensation in our operating expense, which was previously specified for Celgene when it was a stand-alone company. With respect to OI&E since the close of the transaction, we have incorporated both the interest expense on legacy Celgene debt and have begun recognizing interest expense on acquisition financing that had previously been specified since its issuance last May. Also, our Q4 tax rate was primarily impacted by several one-time favorable items including the resolution of uncertain tax provision and provision adjustments for filings in the U.S. and other markets.",1.2008048,0.818

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Looking to 2020 from a financial perspective on slide 15, we provided guidance reflecting the strength and momentum in the business, plus our new launch products and indications and the realization of synergies. First, it's important to note that our guidance on non-GAAP earnings per share reflects the expected 40% accretion to the BMS standalone P&L and includes significantly higher operating margins than in the past.",0.6708249,0.735

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,43,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"First, we expect BARACLUDE to continue to decline based on the maturity of that drug and generic competition. We expect VIDAZA will be impacted in 2020 by generics in Europe. And we expect the rest of the established brands portfolio to decrease by about one-third compared to the 2019 pro forma results. This is driven by the full year impact of the OTEZLA divestiture as well as further generic erosion of the HIV portfolio.",1.8869215,0.273
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,44,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"OI&E includes incremental interest expense offset by royalties. From an interest perspective in our non-GAAP P&L, interest expense will be driven by approximately $45 billion of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%. Note that royalties from the AstraZeneca are stepping up in 2020 and we also expect higher royalties on our PD-1 patents. Altogether we expect royalties to roughly offset interest expense in the year.",0.7625755,0.91

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,47,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,The full year amount of the stock-based compensation for Celgene in 2019 was roughly $800 million on a non-GAAP basis which was incremental to the BMS standalone stock-based compensation. We expect levels of stock-based compensation to remain elevated in 2020 and begin to taper down over time as the Celgene and BMS legacy plans converge.,2.1605634,0.0

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,50,Remarks,2020-02-06,4,2019,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Remember, there will continue to be a dilutive impact for the stock options that remain in the money. That said, no additional options will be granted under the legacy Celgene plan. So, over time this impact will lessen as the compensation plans from the both legacy companies converge. As you can see, we've guided our weighted average share count for the year to be approximately 2.3 billion shares for the year.",0.5686117,0.494

We repurchased 105 million shares in 2019, 99 million in Q4 under the $7 billion ASR, mostly due to the 80% retired upfront.

This provides us with the flexibility to execute disciplined share repurchases to manage the dilution from stock-based compensation and stabilizing the share count into the next year. Although, typically we don't provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality of the legacy Celgene portfolio, specifically Revlimid revenue is historically a bit lighter in the first quarter than the full year average run rate.",0.7448692,0.891

First, I know, Giovanni, you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but can you just elaborate on the first-line lung strategy in Europe post the last week's 227 update? And then when we think about first-line lung in the U.S. is Opdivo+Yervoy and the 227 data the primary focus? Or do you feel that the 9LA regimen of chemo Opdivo+Yervoy will be the bigger focus? I'm trying to figure out how you're balancing those, I guess, two data sets.",0.6321415,0.669
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,63,Question,2020-02-06,4,2019,Chris Schott,JPMorgan Chase,"And then my second question was, another one, just as we think about 2020 for Opdivo. When you look at where the Street is shaking out here, which, I think, is about a 5% erosion for Opdivo this year versus 2019, do you feel like consensus properly captures the balance of the second-line lung erosion relative to the growth you're seeing in some of these other indications? Thanks so much.",2.1909325,0.743
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,64,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Thank you, Chris. So first of all, let me just say, as I mentioned in my remarks, our focus in Europe for first-line lung cancer, obviously, has shifted to 9LA, which we believe has -- and we've said before, is an important study. Let me just ask Chris Boerner to give you a perspective on our overall strategy for first-line lung cancer in the U.S., as we think about the two trials. And then, Chris can provide some perspective on Opdivo performance and the various components of that in 2020 as well.",1.9204771,-0.402
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,65,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. I mean, I think we continue to see 227 and 9LA as being thought of in the U.S. very much in conjunction with one another. If you go back, what we hear consistently from physicians who have seen the 227 data is that; number one, they're impressed with the potential for long-term survival with dual I-O therapy.",2.2756171,0.84
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,66,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"They note the depth and durability of complete remissions, all coming with a very manageable safety profile. And so, they see that as an important opportunity for patients who either don't need or don't want chemotherapy. And incidentally, I would say, that the NCCN listing, 2A listing that we got back in December is a recognition both of the unmet need that continues to exist in first-line lung cancer, as well as the potential that exists for dual I-O therapy.",1.868736,0.569
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,67,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"What 9LA then brings to the table is, answering the question, for those patients who do need chemotherapy, does concomitant chemotherapy, two cycles in this case, along with dual I-O therapy, provide a benefit? And we're very happy to see a second study that demonstrates overall survival. So as physicians in the U.S. think about these studies, they very much think about them in combination with one another. And that's an important part of how we are going to think about our long-term strategy in first-line lung cancer.",1.6278983,0.101
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,68,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"As it relates to 2020 and how we think about the business, let me say just a couple of things. First of all, the business for Opdivo in the U.S. continues to perform in line with our expectations. In second-line lung cancer, eligibility is still on the order of 30% to 35%. We expect that's going to flatten out around 30% this year.",0.1417352,-0.66

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,70,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"As we think about this year, as David mentioned, the business is going to continue to still be under pressure. As a reminder that pressure really comes from three tumors: it's second-line lung cancer, where we've talked about the dynamics there; and it's small cell; and head and neck. And in those two tumors it's a very similar dynamic to lung cancer, where you've seen competitive approvals in the first-line impacting eligibility in the second line. But I would say importantly, our assumption for this year is that our shares in the second-line setting across those tumors remain stable. It's just stable within a smaller pool of patients.",0.2056844,-0.159

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,79,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And what we saw over there is of course the overall survival improvement as well as an improvement in the relapse-free survival. And this is an oral agent, so convenience of delivery for these patients becomes very, very important. And this is the first and only treatment that has shown a survival benefit in the maintenance setting. So we remain excited about that and we're looking forward towards discussions with the health authority and the filings going forward. Of course, here we also continue to think about the overall life-cycle management plan with our portfolio and the combinations that could be available in the future.",3.3563218,0.938
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,80,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"As it comes to the CELMoDs and then I will pass it on to Nadim to comment more on I think CELMoDs are certainly a very, very exciting addition to the overall portfolio and in the armamentarium that we look forward to developing in multiple myeloma. We see this as absolute necessary opportunity. And one of the data sets that we presented in ASCO 2019 were for CC-220, where we saw that patients who had received prior treatment with IMiD, proteasome inhibitors, daratumumab they still went on to have a response rate of 31%. And these are durable responses that we saw in this late-line setting.",1.123266,0.789
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,81,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So we have additional plans for not only CC-220 but CC-480, which is another CELMoD looking at multiple myeloma setting. And there are a multitude of opportunities with our overall portfolio of cell therapies as well as the T-cell engagers, where we will continue to think about how to do treatments for further improvement in the outcome of these patients where cure still does not exist. So we'll be sharing those plans in the coming months as we look forward. But let me pass it on to Nadim to talk a little bit more from the commercial perspective.",0.8367023,0.949

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,86,Question,2020-02-06,4,2019,Geoff Meacham,JPMorgan Chase,"Good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. For David or for Giovanni, for 2021 guidance, I know you guys don't want to give details, but generally should we assume that earnings growth will be mostly from the return to growth for I-O and maybe new launches? Or is it more from the operational synergy side of things? And then for Nadim, what is the credit field for BCMA-targeted therapies? Just curious about the status of moving bb2121 up to second-line myeloma and when you guys think about the BCMA modalities in your pipeline, how do you all reconcile bi-specifics with CAR-Ts and others? Thank you.",1.4736842,0.966
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,87,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Thank you, Geoff. Let me start. Obviously, when you look at 2121 as we've said, we have an opportunity to return to growth for Opdivo. We have a number of really exciting launch opportunities and I've mentioned several of those. And so there is real momentum in the business, which is driven by the portfolio and how new launches come into play. That's the reason why I feel really good about the fact that the guidance we provided from -- for 2021 is driven by dynamics in the portfolio that are very encouraging for us.",0.1100066,0.979
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,88,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Of course, we will be disciplined with respect to continuing to execute on the synergies. And as you know, we've updated that we feel comfortable with the $2.5 billion about one-third will come this year and we expect about one-third to come next year. But I think the growth of next year, we're really excited about the portfolio opportunities playing out. Let me just ask Samit and Nadim to ask you -- to answer your second question.",1.0937707,0.934
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,89,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you, Giovanni, and thanks Geoff for the question on the BCMA portfolio. So from a BCMA CAR T-cell perspective from ide-cel perspective, we've already shared some of the data last year at ASH looking at ide-cel in the fourth-line plus patient population where we saw a CR rate of 31% overall. And we're certainly excited towards continuing to expand that portfolio and towards filing of that data set itself. There are three additional studies that are currently ongoing as you can see on ClinicalTrials.gov. KarMMa-2 is the study I think that sort of answers your question that we are beginning to look at the second-line setting. So we're looking at using ide-cel in the second-line patient population.",1.1395164,0.917
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,90,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"KarMMa-2 is a randomized Phase III study looking at ide-cel versus a triplet therapy for patients in the third-line plus setting. And then KarMMa-4 was just initiated at the end of last year looking at the first-line patient population in a Phase I/II study. So we're really excited towards looking into the outcomes of these studies and the data generation. And when we talk about the overall portfolio from a BCMA perspective, I think all the emerging data tells us that BCMA is absolutely an important target that we need to be able to attack from various modalities, whether it be through the cell therapies that we talked about or the T-cell engager that we have now shared the data from the Phase 1 Study -269 and certainly looking forward to now looking at how to bring that forward as more data matures and accelerate that development plan. And then, of course, we'll look into our pipeline how to combine these with as we previously discussed with CELMoD et cetera. But let me pass it on to Nadim to give you a little bit more on that.",2.1973841,0.781

So first of all with respect to guidance I think, as we said from the beginning, we were not going to go back and update the S-4 from last year. As you know there have been a number of things that have happened since last year; the divestiture of Otezla as you mentioned; the divestiture of our UPSA consumer medicines business; and on the other side continued really strong performance with our in-line business and significant progress with the pipeline, which obviously is a key driver of our performance in the next few years.",0.2720345,0.92
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,99,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So overall as I mentioned also in my remarks, I feel better today about where we are than I felt a year ago when we first announced the deal. And the strength of our in-line business and the progress made with our pipeline make me feel really good about the future and the key drivers that were behind the confidence we had last year and we have today in the business.",0.9247846,0.937

I made some comments about our perspective on 2022 and we feel pretty good about where we are. So now with respect to Revlimid also there, there have been good developments. First of all, I would say the in-line performance of the brand continues to be strong and the teams are doing a great job continuing to support an important franchise. I think that's important.",0.1438038,0.975

We did reach a settlement with Alvogen, which was aligned with our expectations. And I would say that overall, we continue to see the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid as a slope. That is driven by sort of all the same assumptions that we've discussed in the past. There has been good development and so nothing has really changed there.",0.8502319,0.586

I was wondering first on Opdivo, if you can give us your latest thoughts on the opportunity in adjuvant bladder following the Roche data. Just wondering, if there are any notable trial design differences you could point to for your study versus their trial. And then on bb2121 and JCAR and the commercial ramp on the forward, anything you guys have learned from the competitive CAR T launches that you can leverage? And would you expect to have stronger launches as a result? Thank you.",0.179321,0.93

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,106,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Sure. Thank you for the question, Terence. And as it relates to the adjuvant setting, first of all, let me start by saying that immuno-oncology products are going to play a major role in the adjuvant setting because, the earlier we can utilize these treatments, it will provide an opportunity to not only shift the level of recurrence, but provide a potential for cure for these patients. And overall, as we move earlier and earlier from the metastatic setting to the earlier setting, the overall plan that we have in place, we feel very confident about it in non-small cell lung cancer melanoma, RCC, gastric and of course in bladder cancer as well. There -- it's no point trying to do cross-trial comparisons.",1.5097107,-0.682
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,107,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"At this point, I think we are pretty close to where we will be starting to see the data emerging. I think just to keep in mind that, the overall patient population that we've enrolled seems very similar. And without getting into the specifics, the one major difference is placebo used in our trial versus observation in the other trial and the treatment duration is different. But I think, we should wait for the data for it to read out, rather than getting into the specifics at this time. But I think, Chris can give you more color on the commercial side.",1.4922711,0.494
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,108,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yes. So let me just say something on a macro level with respect to the adjuvant programs and then I'll talk specifically about bladder. Just a reminder, that as you think about the adjuvant setting, you need to think not only about the patients who are treated today, but also the potential for patients to be treated. So, what we saw when we launched I-O in the adjuvant melanoma space was that you saw treatment rates increase significantly. And then a number of the tumors in which we are pursuing our early-stage program, you see treatment rates in the low to single digits ultimately up to potentially around 40% for some tumors. But still there's plenty of opportunity for us to not only treat patients who are being treated today, but with improved therapies, improve the treatment rates overall.",2.2191473,0.935
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,109,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"With respect to bladder cancer specifically, this is a very large patient population. It's highly fragmented. And we have importantly multiple opportunities in the muscle-invasive space. About 50% of those patients are getting surgery today. We have CheckMate-078 which is in the periadjuvant setting. We're looking at the entire population with CheckMate-274 and we also have a non-muscle invasive bladder program as well. So, it's an important opportunity for us. We are still very confident in the opportunity for I-O in the adjuvant setting and we very much look forward to seeing the data.",0.4562453,0.931

BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,119,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yeah. So let me address that, Matt. So as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we saw Opdivo decline on the quarter versus same time last year about 2%. And let me just characterize that. That was entirely driven by the U.S., which was down about 10%, but virtually all of that decline year-over-year as a result of the dynamics we've been talking about quite a bit, which are the dynamics in second-line lung cancer.",3.079282,-0.19
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,120,Answer,2020-02-06,4,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"As you look on a sequential basis the U.S. was down roughly 6%. About half of that was a result of the inventory work down with the VA. The remaining portion of that was mainly the second-line eligibility issue in lung cancer. We saw a little bit of an impact in eligibility in small-cell lung cancer and head and neck. But importantly, if you normalize for the VA inventory movements what you see in both Q3 and Q4 from a demand standpoint was Opdivo was down as David mentioned in low single digits around 2% to 3%. And importantly, as we see both 2020 and 2021, the impacts that you saw in the quarter will have no material impact on what we see for the year as a whole in 2020 and for the growth opportunities for Opdivo as we go into 2021.",0.183994,-0.7
BMY-2019-Q4-2020-02-06,123,Question,2020-02-06,4,2019,Steve Scala,Cowen & Co.,"Thank you. I have two questions both for clarification. First, Giovanni to clarify on what you said about growth in 2022, did you say you see growth into 2022 or through 2022 although moderating? And if into, is there any scenario where earnings would be down in 2022? So that's the first question. And the second one is on the other income expense guidance for 2020. It appears way better than one would expect given the financing costs. Now you mentioned the step-up in royalties on KEYTRUDA and the AstraZeneca diabetes products in 2020. But I thought that the KEYTRUDA royalty was flat at 6.5% through 2024 and the AstraZeneca royalties are either flat at or step down in 2020. So are you saying that the royalty rates are the same, but the products will grow or something different? And I don't think there's a lot of optimism about the AstraZeneca diabetes portfolio. So I'm wondering again, is it the royalty rates are changing or the products' royalties are changing? So please clarify. Thank you.",0.4344322,0.956

So when I spoke about 2022, I'm speaking about growth in 2022 moderated by in terms of the growth rate by the potential beginning of the entrance of generics for Revlimid in 2022. So I see at this point our business growing in 2022 as a year with the moderation of the growth rate versus 2021 driven by the dynamic I just discussed. David?",0.2428761,0.912

First, we continue to execute very well in highly competitive markets, with sales increasing 6% compared to the same period last year on a pro forma basis. In addition, we are making good progress across our launches. And during the quarter, we have seen significant clinical progress including multiple positive trials in IO, as well as the first Phase 3 trial for deucravacitinib.

This demonstrates strong execution of our teams and best-in-class profile brands. As we discussed previously, we accrue our liability related to the coverage gap as patients enter it, which affects our second half gross to net results. This is more pronounced this year, as the size of the coverage gap per patient increased in 2020 and Medicare component is a larger component of our mix.

Underlying demand growth from Q2 to Q3 was approximately 2%. Sales grew 6% versus quarter two, driven by growing underlying demand, as well as the favorable customer buying patterns.

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Internationally, we've seen strong commercial execution across the board with sales up 5% versus prior year. Sequentially, we saw a rebound to a stronger demand, driven primarily by the European and Japanese markets, as the markets continued to gain reimbursement for new indications in first-line RCC and melanoma. While there continues to be some softness in new patient starts across tumors, but most notably in melanoma, we generally saw good recovery of the impact of COVID in Q3. And we also look forward to bringing Opdivo plus Yervoy and limited chemotherapy to the first-line lung cancer patients in Europe this quarter. As we look forward, we expect several additional near-term launches in 2021, including the potential for first-line gastric and several adjutant indications such as esophageal and muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Opdivo plus Cabo in first-line RCC for which we were granted a priority review.",1.0414487,-0.743

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Moving on to our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio on slide 12, Revlimid and Pomalyst continue to perform very well with strong double digit growth on a pro forma basis. Revlimid grew 10%, primarily driven on increased treatment duration. And Pomalyst grew 17%, driven by growth in earlier lines of treatment and increased treatment duration. In the U.S., we experienced some temporary softness to the new to brand share from COVID, which is now recovering. And this is being offset by better adherence and longer duration of therapy for existing patients. ex-U.S. pro forma sales for Revlimid increased 11%, while ex-U.S. pro forma sales for Pomalyst increased 19%. This strong performance was driven by increased use of triplet based therapies and treatment duration in major European markets. COVID had a minimal impact on ongoing patient treatment, with a small impact observed in new patient starts. We are seeing strong signs of new patients returning to prior treatment patterns.",0.8905433,0.983

Reblozyl has been off to a robust start with the approval of RS-positive MDS-associated anemia. Global sales in the quarter were $96 million, representing 75% sequential growth over quarter two. In the U.S. physician feedback remains positive with significant awareness of the brand. While still early, we continue to be pleased with the launch, including new patient uptake and patient retention on the product with the majority of patients that adhere to the treatment. As a reminder, a significant proportion of early uptake is driven by the initial bolus of patients waiting for a new treatment option.

While very early in the launch, feedback from physicians has been promising. The message with Onureg, the first and only medicine that demonstrates overall survival in the maintenance setting with a convenient oral route of administration is resonating well. This is a market that is largely underdeveloped, as there were previously no FDA approved options for patients in the maintenance setting after intensive chemotherapy. And like many other medicines in the maintenance setting, it will take some time to educate prescribers about the use of new treatment for patients.

We expect total spend to be generally in line with our expectations. We do have some slight shifts in spend related to our MS&A and R&D lines. For MS&A, we decided to make additional one-time investments, such as accelerating DTC advertising to support the business as we close out the year, and we now expect to spend approximately $6.9 billion. This is being offset by lower R&D expense, now expected to be approximately $9.2 billion. At the same time, we remain very-pleased with our synergy capture, which, as Giovanni mentioned, is tracking ahead of our original expectations. We now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16% for the full year.

I guess, just two here, maybe first on TYK2. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the safety profile? I think, there's still some lingering questions out there of will we see any of maybe some of the JAK-like safety issues? I know you've talked a lot about that in the past. But just to confirm, did you see any imbalance at all, small or not, on thrombotic events from the study? And, just help us a little bit in terms of what the profile is shaping up like, on the safety there? And then, my second question was on Opdivo. You're launching a number of adjuvant indications next year. Could you just remind us on those, do you expect that these will have fast uptake, like we're seeing in some of the metastatic settings, or are these indications that maybe take a little bit longer to build out over time?

There is a differentiated mechanism of action that we believe in. We do think that the TYK2 inhibition, which has a specific downstream effect on IL-12, IL-23 as well as interferon alpha has played out, and we continue to believe in that. Of course, I can't go into the specifics of the data. They will be presented in the future in the medical meeting. But overall, we are very happy where we are. And I look forward to the readout of the second Phase 3 in the first quarter of 2021.",2.1607025,0.831

BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,54,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. We do have a number of exciting opportunities in the adjuvant setting. I'll maybe just highlight gastric and bladder specifically. As we talked about a few months ago with respect to gastric cancer, we're excited about the opportunity coming out of CheckMate -577. This is a space where there's significant unmet need. There's very little in the way of systemic therapy that's used here. And as Samit has previously talked about, those patients who are getting neo-adjuvant chemo radiotherapy, about three quarters of those patients don't get a path CR. So, really, there are no great options for those patients. And we've seen very good efficacy coming out of -577 with a doubling of DFS at a manageable safety profile. And there is relative clean air here from a competitive standpoint as we'll be the first IO in the setting for a number of years.",0.5800299,0.981
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,55,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"With respect to bladder, again, happy with the results that we saw with -274. This is a space with about 6,000 to 7,000 treated patients in the U.S. Again, not a lot in the way of great systemic therapies here. And as we've said, we met the primary endpoint for Opdivo and very much look forward to launching in the space. And this is again another space where there's relative clean air. So, we would expect reasonably aggressive uptake in both of these indications.",0.8896784,0.919
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,58,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you, Seamus, for the question and quite appropriate in fact. When you look at the POETYK1 readout, as we said in the press release, the dose used in the Phase 3 trial is the 6-milligram dose. And what you have in the abstract and the poster at the ACR for psoriatic arthritis, as you mentioned, are both, so 6 and the 12-milligram dose. We do see a profile from a safety perspective of the 6-milligram dose as we talked about. Also in looking at the older Phase 2 study, generally very good at that dose. And that's the efficacy we have now seen in the Phase 3 study as well.",1.2857709,0.862
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,59,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"At the 12-milligram dose, we do see a dose response. But then, you have to keep in mind as you very correctly said, the overall safety management is got. So, we'll continue to dig deeper into the data as we plan Phase 3 study in the psoriatic arthritis space. But overall, we are very happy with the dose that we have tested in the Phase 2 study. And of course, as I said earlier, we look at it again, in the Phase 3 -- the second readout in the first quarter of next year as we move forward. So, that's I think the differentiation. But, it's not just about efficacy. We have to balance the benefit risk. And that's why the 6-milligram dose seems quite reasonable for us from a safety and efficacy combined benefit risk ratio.",1.216409,0.908
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,60,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"As it relates to the ulcerative colitis, the mechanism, as you very well said, I think, the differentiation, the oral administration, the convenience of treatment, we've talked about psoriatic arthritis already, and now we are looking towards readout in the future for the TYK2 program. And bringing that differentiated mechanism once again and hopefully be able to show the efficacy and safety for patients with ulcerative colitis with TYK2 will be important. And yes, IL-12 and IL-23 inhibition mechanism is going to play a big role, both in ulcerative colitis and then in the future Crohn's disease as well.",1.1652794,0.913

So, when you look at the first-line lung trends for Opdivo, Chris, you guys have gained some share, I think 5% or so in the U.S. But, I don't see much of a trend break this quarter. Was there already reasonable share in first-line lung, before the label expansion? And maybe just help us to what's been the feedback from the ground so far? And the second one on Reblozyl, the sequential trends have been really strong. I know obviously it's early. But, what can you say about the distribution between MDS and beta-thal and maybe just the cadence of uptake between the two indications? Thanks a lot, guys.",1.8560474,0.971
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,63,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Maybe I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Nadim to address the second part of your question. So, with respect to Opdivo, let me just first give you the dynamics for the quarter. So, obviously, happy with the sequential growth that we saw for the quarter. That in the U.S. is a function of favorable demand, and I'll talk about first-line lung, specifically in the second. We also, as David had noted, saw some inventory build. This was partially offset by the impact that we've seen with the decline in IO eligibility that we've been discussing previously. That's mainly in the second-line thoracic indications. And that still is a drag on Opdivo currently. That said, we're happy to see that we've got sequential growth for the quarter. And that was in part a function of first-line lung. And with respect to first-line lung, we're very happy with what we're seeing with the launches so far in the U.S. The uptake continues to increase steadily. As we noted earlier, the market share is currently in the high single digits. The execution here continues to be very good. So, for example, we have a leading share in first-line lung. And importantly, at this stage of the launch, we're seeing a nice steady growth in the number of new trials week-over-week. So, overall, we're happy with the uptake that we've seen.",0.9263276,0.993

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"We knew, as we discussed previously that this was going to be a different set of launches, just given the entrenched dynamics from a competitive standpoint in first-line lung. But, we continue to be very pleased with the team's performance here. So, maybe I'll turn it over to Nadim for the second part of your question.",1.1028422,0.718
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,67,Question,2020-11-05,3,2020,Terence Flynn,Goldman Sachs,"Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering, first, on Opdivo for neo-adjuvant lung, if you can give us any update on the regulatory path and when you might know more there, and if you're confident that you could get approval on the PCR endpoint alone. And then, the second question, you mentioned that the synergies are tracking ahead of your expectations. I guess, just trying to understand how much of the spend is synergies and how much is kind of from a COVID environment? And so, how much of that should we expect to carry forward into 2021? Thank you.",2.3018519,0.877

As Chris mentioned earlier, there is still obviously a much required need for new medicines in patients with early disease to be able to get into a pathological complete response because that may signal for the long-term benefit for these patients. Now, of course, this is not a validated regulatory endpoint, as you very well said. So, what we are looking forward to now, of course, continuing our dialogue with the regulatory agencies, especially with the FDA, as we also continue to follow these patients for the first data for event-free survival as well. So, we will obviously keep you posted in the future as we make progress. At the current time, we continue our dialogue and continue with the patient follow-up to generate more data. I don't think we can give a clear guidance today in terms of approvability, based on the endpoint.",0.4157749,0.919

Look, we've been very pleased with our ability to capture synergies so far this year. And we're really encouraged to see that our synergy capture is actually tracking ahead of our original expectations for this year. So, we'll provide further insight to that on our expectations of the overall synergy achievement, after we close the year, but things are going very well.",0.0414487,0.88
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,73,Question,2020-11-05,3,2020,Tim Anderson,Prudential,"I have a question on going back to TYK2. So, I think, most investors view the value proposition in psoriasis relative to Otezla being better efficacy. But, we've wondered if better tolerability could also be a differentiator, because with Otezla, there's GI side effects that require dose titration, and your drug doesn't require dose titration. And at least in Phase 2, there were no GI side effects. So, when we see the full Phase 3 results, might we also see better tolerability as yet another area of differentiation, beyond just oral dosing and beyond better efficacy?",1.7167702,0.896
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,74,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you, Tim, for the question. As we said, if you look at the overall trial design for this one as well as for the next study to be followed, the good news is that there is a comparison, not only versus placebo but also the comparison versus the Otezla. And so, there will certainly be an opportunity to contrast and compare not only the efficacy, but all of the tolerability or safety as we talk about. And those are going to be very important from a patient perspective and physician perspective, from a convenience perspective. Certainly, these will have implications from a commercial perspective. And let me pass it on to Chris to comment on that.",0.5778835,0.963
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,75,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Tim. I mean, I think, as we said previously, we're excited with the opportunity that we have here, based on the data that we see coming out of POETYK. I think, we have a real opportunity to establish TYK as the frontline branded oral choice for these moderate to severe patients. What I would say, just to build on what Samit mentioned, is that this is a market where in spite of new biologics coming into the space, dermatologists continue to believe in an ascending treatment algorithm. So, they typically start with topical, they move to oral, then they go to injectables. And it is also a market, as I think you point out, where patient preference drives choice. So, you do see a very strong focus on safety concerns, needle phobia is an issue here. And we think these dynamics really play to the profile that we have with TYK2, very strong efficacy in an oral formulation, a novel MOA, and a favorable tolerability and safety profile. And so, we think we've got real opportunity here to establish TYK as the leading oral in the space.",0.2139117,0.981
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,77,Question,2020-11-05,3,2020,Andrew Baum,Morgan Stanley,"Thank you. Couple of questions, please. First on Otezla. As you think about marketing, is it positioned to displace Otezla as the oral agent of choice, given the efficacy, tolerability, or to what extent can you actually seek to slow or defer the initiation of therapy with biologics? And then, second, perhaps you could just give us the market shares in non-small cell for 227, 9LA in the U.S. in the first-line setting.",1.5084845,0.586
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,79,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. Andrew, thanks for the question. With respect to Otezla and how we are looking at the TYK opportunity in psoriasis, I mean, I think, the way I answered the previous question is probably what I would go back to. We think, based on these data that TYK has the opportunity to be the branded oral of choice for moderate-to-severe patients with large in this space. And we think that's a reflection of the fact that this is a market where dermatologists typically are going to try to treat with less burdensome routes of administration. They're going to go for the activity that -- the best activity they can find. However, safety is a prominent concern here. And so, I think that we have the opportunity to displace existing therapy with respect to orals prebiologic. And we also believe that we have the opportunity to potentially provide more of an opportunity before patients move on to biologics. And remember, this is a space where only about 15% of patients ultimately ever get to biologics, and that's in spite of a number of new biologics coming into the market. So, we think we actually have an opportunity to do both.",0.9955123,0.986

BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,84,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So, for ASH perspective, over the last few years, certainly, both Celgene and -- Celgene as well BMS have had data presence. And based on the data that has been presented in the past, so obviously, these medicines have now moved on to late-stage development. And we are continuing to gather more data. Having said that, there are a few abstracts that are very important that are being presented. So, number one, the activity of liso-cel -- the single therapy as well as in combination where the group -- patients who received ibrutinib and venetoclax, both in CLL are quite important and interesting. If you look at the overall response rate, tolerability as well as durability in these patients, that continue to evolve. Especially as you think of the future where the population with CLL or patients with CLL have been treated with ibrutinib and venetoclax, there will be a need for subsequent therapy that will rescue them if the disease has a recurrence or relapse.",0.9869203,0.95

And those are evolutions in the data set, and we'll continue to see how that comes through, but certainly response rates are going to be burdened as we look forward to moving iberdomide into the earlier settings as these data will then start dictating how we proceed further. So, very happy with it.

So certainly, we're going to look for an opportunity for a proper presentation of the data at a future medical meeting. That is not dependent on the regulatory aspects, because it's an independent endpoint that can certainly be discussed. So, we're looking to that. I think, the trial details, we have not shared the statistical analysis plan per se in terms of the assumptions made for the calculation at this time. So, we'll not be able to share that.

In those cases, as you know, we made a choice to partner those assets because we want to be working with another company that together enables us to have a broader reach into a primary care market and support the development of assets that require very large investments in the development of the asset across multiple indications. I think, when you look at mavacamten, it's much more of a precision approach to cardiovascular, which fits really nicely with our R&D strategy. And actually, it's very consistent with the early pipeline we have in a heart failure cardiovascular. So, I don't think it's necessarily one approach versus the other.",1.5069583,0.934

There are two things that are going to be important to remember is, number one, there are still bleeding risks and patients don't necessarily get treated with true doses of currently available treatments, and some patients are not even treated because of the bleeding risk. The second unmet medical need is that patients cannot be treated on top of their background antiplatelet therapies for indications such as the secondary strokes. And that is very high unmet medical need and patients who have had a first stroke are at very high risk of experience and the second stroke maybe even 50% to 60% probability.",0.9433214,0.778

BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,117,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Thank you, David. Let me just reiterate, I think, specifically to your question, when we look at the period during which over time, the slope of Revlimid will take place between 2022 to -- sorry, 2022 to 2026. First of all, I think, it is playing out the way we had modeled it to be a slope that starts at a point where the overall performance of the brand has been really strong. And our view of IP and the strength of IP has been validated by the IP already that we're not granted and the two settlements that David mentioned. At the same time, the strength of our business beyond revenue has continued to be really, really good. The progress we've made with the pipeline has given us real confidence in our ability as a company to continue to renew the portfolio. So, as I mentioned at the beginning, I feel really good about our ability to continue to perform very strongly as we renew our portfolio during the time in which over time Revlimid will lose exclusivity. That's what we set up to do from the very beginning. And I think, execution so far has been really strong, which makes me confident in our ability to continue to be successful during that time.",1.5506958,0.993
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,120,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you for the questions, Matt. First of all, on the TYK2 aspect, so you know that we are very happy with the results from the POETYK1 study. You also know that there is a broad program already underway where we have the evaluation ongoing in psoriatic arthritis and lupus, SLE, lupus, arthritis as well as the inflammatory bowel disease. Mild psoriasis, we certainly have eye on it. We obviously think about this as we evolve with the data on the psoriasis, we have to look at the overall efficacy and safety profile in the second study also readout. And that will dictate where we go next in terms of evaluation of deucravacitinib in psoriasis and other indications related to psoriasis.",1.1850971,0.915
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,124,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Sure. Thank you, Carter. I think, great questions. First of all on the TIGIT side, we certainly have seen the announcement from the competitor from discontinuation of the program on the side. And we don't know the details and the structure of their molecule, et cetera. But certainly, we have our own molecule, which is in Phase 1 study. We also have been looking at to see where we go with the combination very early on to be able to define the path forward. As the data evolves, we'll certainly update you and others in terms of where we go or what the fate of the program will be. But, too early to say from our own perspective, the specificity of inert Fc portion or inactive Fc portion, I think needs to be further investigated before decisive decision can be made on that side. So, more to follow on TIGIT in the future.",1.424891,0.943
BMY-2020-Q3-2020-11-05,126,Answer,2020-11-05,3,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"But if you recall, the overall development of IMiD in the past, Revlimid and pomalidomide, how they were developed in the organization, how Revlimid then set up in the upfront setting and pomalidomide then became a preferred molecule for the second, third-line patient population. So, we have to keep that in mind as we continue to evolve. And we also have the good position that we have a lot of data available from multiple myeloma perspective that we can actually investigate to see what is the mechanism where these drugs will fit the best, what opportunities we may be able to avail in terms of combination strategies with our own pipeline, looking at the platforms that we already have, not only with CELMoDs, but also from the T-cell engager, from CAR-T cell therapy as well as the evolving ADC platform. So, those opportunities, because of the few CELMoDs we have in our hand can certainly be further investigated in a broader way, rather than limiting ourselves to a singlular CELMoDs.",1.3884265,0.962

Let me start with our top-line performance on Slide 8. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong double-digit growth this quarter, driven by increased demand for our key medicines across the globe. Looking at the first half of the year, which normalizes for most of the COVID-related buying patterns we experienced last year, commercial performance was strong, up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding currency. This robust performance demonstrates both our strong execution of our commercial teams as well as increased demand for our products. I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9.",1.3947686,0.976
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,21,Remarks,2021-07-28,2,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"This was another strong quarter for Eliquis, with global sales up 29% versus last year. Second quarter growth benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison as prior year included the unwinding with COVID-related buying patterns. When looking at the first half to normalize for this dynamic, sales remained strong, up 18%. In the U.S., we saw strong demand with total prescription growth of 14% versus prior year driven by market share gains, which continue to expect strong new-to-brand share growth [for further] translates to overall total prescription growth.",1.2052314,0.986
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,22,Remarks,2021-07-28,2,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As a reminder, when we look toward the third and fourth quarters, we expect similar dynamics from the Medicare coverage gap as seen in previous years. Internationally, we had very strong demand across all key geographies, as we further gained share as the number one OAC in multiple markets, and we continue to see additional room to grow. Overall, we remain very pleased with the execution of Eliquis around the world, and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class. Now, turning to Opdivo on Slide 10, let me start by saying we're very pleased to deliver return to growth this quarter, up 16% versus last year.",1.1110664,0.963
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,23,Remarks,2021-07-28,2,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"While COVID recovery dynamics as well as approximately 40 million in U.S. inventory build contributed to this quarter 's growth, the brand's performance was largely driven by strong demand for both our core and our newly launched indications. In the U.S., sales were up 13% year-over-year, as well as 14% sequentially, driven by launches in lung, RCC, and our upper GI cancers, which are all going well, and in lungshares in the low-double digits with positive momentum, and we're seeing use across all histologies.",1.1513078,0.943
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,24,Remarks,2021-07-28,2,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"In RCC, our Opdivo plus Cabo launch continues to do well, with Opdivo now the leading PD-1 first-line renal across both available regimens. In upper GI, we saw a very strong start with Opdivo plus chemo in first-line gastric cancer with CheckMate -649 which reached 25% to 30% share in just a few months based upon the strength of our data. The adjuvant esophageal launch, while still in early days, is off to a great start. Overall, we see upper GI as an important opportunity for Opdivo based on the breadth of offered indications and the fact that Opdivo is the only PD therapy approved for HER2 negative gastric cancer. Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with sales up 13%, excluding the impact of foreign currency versus last year.",0.5839034,0.902
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,25,Remarks,2021-07-28,2,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Growth was primarily driven by demand of our new launches in lung and renal cancer. Results also benefited from a favorable comparison due to COVID-related impact last year. All in all, we're very pleased with Opdivo 's performance and future growth outlook based on the positive momentum for our current launches, our future potential launches, including muscle-invasive bladder cancer and first-line esophageal, as well as potential expansion opportunities from clinical trials that we will lead out over time. Now, turning to Slide 11, regarding our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio. Revlimid was up globally, primarily driven by demand for triplet-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. In the U.S., we are encouraged to see prescriptions nearing pre-COVID levels. Pomalyst global sales were up 15%, driven by continued strong demand for triplet-based therapies and use in earlier lines.",0.3710262,0.906

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now moving to our recent launches on slide 12, we continue to be very pleased with our new launches. Beginning with Reblozyl, which generated $128 million in Q2 and increased 14% sequentially. As the bolus from the MDS launches continue to wind down, it's being replaced by underlying demand growth as expected. We continue to expect sustained growth in the second half of the year as we remain focused on treating new patients earlier in their treatment journey and ensuring they receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit.",0.7183099,0.94

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Moving to Zeposia, which generated $28 million in the quarter, the MS launch continues to progress well, where Zeposia is the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions, and where we continue to see high intent to prescribe metrics. We have also seen an acceleration in the conversion time from written prescriptions to commercially-supplied products. Looking forward, we see -- we continue to focus on establishing Zeposia not only as the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice for MS. Beyond MS, we launched Zeposia and ulcerative colitis in the U.S. in early June.",0.5754527,0.494

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"While early in the launch, we are very encouraged by physician receptivity to the product so far. Our plan is to focus on stepwise process of building volume by establishing demand for this differentiator oral-like biologic-like medicine, while maximizing access overtime. Turning to Onureg, the launch is also going well with double-digit demand growth over prior quarter, we continue to expand the user base with physicians recognizing Onureg as the first and only FDA approved treatment for AML patients, in first remission with a demonstrated OS benefit. Second quarter sales were impacted by reduced inventory, driven by our transition from bottles to blister cards. However, based upon the strength of the underlying demand trends, we expect to see sales rebound in the second half of the year.",0.6136821,0.966

Looking at each of these products internationally, we're encouraged to see how these launches are going, and we look forward to driving growth through gaining access and reimbursement in additional markets over time. Now, I would like to turn to Slide 13 and discuss cell therapy.Demand for our two new differetiated cell therapy products has been strong. Starting with Breyanzi, we were pleased with our launch progress, with Q2 sales of 17 million driven by strong execution and rapid site activation, with more than 65 sites activated to date. messages around our differentiated profile and outpatient utilization are resonating well, with high awareness among CAR-T treaters.",0.5396378,0.971

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Next, as it relates to Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR-T at sales of 24 million in the quarter, led by very strong demand. We were able to leverage the site footprint of Breyanzi to accelerate site onboarding. An advantage of launching two CAR-T medicines simultaneously. Based on the significant unmet demand and differentiated profile, we have seen robust demand for this product, beyond our current capacity and we are looking hard to increase capacity over time. Looking forward, we continue to see meaningful long-term potential with our cell therapy franchise, across both Breyanzi and and Abecma as evidenced by the recent demand we've seen.",0.4849095,0.783

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now, turning to the next slide, a few points as we think about our launch portfolio overall. First, we're very encouraged with how each of these products are progressing at this point in the launch cycle. Together, they have already contributed $225 million this quarter, and are approaching $1 billion run rate. Importantly, we review these products as having significant future potential. This gives us great confidence in our ability to diversify and renew our portfolio as we look forward.",0.5774648,0.939

Since we've already covered sham sales for the quarter, I'll focus on a couple all other key line items. First, gross margin decreased versus prior year, which is primarily due to foreign exchange and product mix. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in MS&A, due to higher launch and pre-launch investments across therapeutic areas, as well as foreign exchange, which were partially offset by our realized synergies. Remember that at the same time period last year, our spend levels were lower than normal due to the initial wave of COVID.",0.2732394,-0.494

We have seen a recovery in the I-O market really coming out of Q1 and into Q2, and I would say that is recovery on multiple parameters.",1.1724009,0.771
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,45,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"First, we've seen new patient claims. While they still lag pre-COVID levels, they've certainly improved quarter-over-quarter. I-O demand continues to recover versus the pre-COVID levels, and in fact grew about 5% quarter-over-quarter.",0.3223635,0.587
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,46,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And importantly, we've seen an increase in in-person engagement. Oncology still lacks other therapeutic areas, but increasingly, our field teams are able to engage live with our customers.

BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,47,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So I would say in general, COVID continues to be dynamic really across markets, and certainly that's true in oncology, but I would say there's been a general improvement as we exited Q1 and into Q2. As for how things are going in gastric cancer, I would say the gastric launch continues to go really very well.",0.4502618,0.975

And while it's truly an apples-to-oranges comparison, if we were to indulge in that, I would say that we don't see a differentiation as might have been perceived, and the reason for that is, if you'd look at it from an efficacy perspective, the measures were at a different time-point first of all, 10 weeks versus a 30-week trial for EXPLORER. Secondly, the differences or the primary endpoints that were measured were at rest and with valsalva maneuver who were in the Redwood trial versus during exercise.",0.2671423,0.44
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,51,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So if you were to compare those apples-to-apples, there is no differentiation that we see. From a safety perspective as well, when we talk about decreasing the ejection fraction, if you start with a higher ejection fraction, of course you will not see as big of a decrease below 50%, which was the case in the Redwood trial. We have patients enrolled in our EXPLORER study with a lower rejection fraction of 55% or lower. And therefore, when we compare apples-to-apples again, in fact, if anything, we could turn out to be better. At the end of it all, I would say we need to wait to see the data in the Phase 3 trial for the competitor molecule. We already have our Phase 3 data. We've already submitted and look forward to bringing it to patients with a PDUFA date in January.",0.0653983,0.586

I know you guys have talked about that previously. And then on Deucravacitinib, maybe just help us with how you're thinking about what success looks like in ulcerative colitis, and also any additional thoughts that you've had?

Importantly for both Abecma and Breyanzi, the profiles for these products are resonating well with customers, in the case of Abecma as a first-in-class BCMA -targeted cell therapy and for Breyanzi as a best-in-class.

BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,62,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"What I would say is the sole focus that we have there is on steadily increasing manufacturing capacity. We have a very strong team that's in place focused on this. We're engaging obviously internally and externally with third parties including regulators to increase the number of slots that we have available for patients, and that's going to be the main focus on that product for the coming months.",0.2762584,0.741

We know what the efficacy that we would be looking for in a Phase 2 study to initiate our Phase 3 program. And the good news is, we also have the Crohn's disease study ongoing which we will lead out next year.

So as I said in the previous question, our focus continues to increase the available capacity that we have for this product, as I think we've discussed previously. We had increased the number of slots that were available for patients to August, and so we were able to increase to meet the demand in August, at the same time, we continue to see a shortage of vector that that is something that's been affecting multiple cell therapy products, and so we're keeping an eye on that, and what I would say, Terence, is that the situation on vector supply continues to be fairly dynamic.",0.6293942,0.743
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,73,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And so with respect to when supply we'll ramp significantly.

For Mavacamten, Tim, we've already filed for Mavacamten, the FDA has already accepted the file. We have a PDUFA date. So those concerns I think are relieved and our -- we are really looking forward to bringing these exciting data, as well as the medicine to patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",0.1053678,0.698
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,114,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"As you know with Mavacamten, we have other plans that are already ongoing and in execution in other disease types as well.

And with respect your first question, Tim on the IP litigation for Eliquis, first of all, as you know, we're very pleased with the decision that was made by the court in that summer, which really confirms the strength of not only the composition of matter patent, but also our formulation patent. And as you mentioned, there is an appeal that has been filed and the hearing is scheduled in September. So we look forward to hearing the result of that process.",1.4029158,0.71
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,119,Question,2021-07-28,2,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then maybe coming back to Iberdomide, some of you talked about the combination study that got posted on clintrials.gov.

So with respect to COVID I would say it's very similar to the answer I gave previously on COVID, I think the dynamics in that market are still evolving, we've not yet seen a full return to normal.",0.8130142,0.94
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,123,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"But what I would say is in the quarter, we also there saw an improvement both with respect to new patients entering the clinic and being given access to therapy, as well as importantly, again, our field team's ability to interact with customers, and that's going to be really important here because you've got to continue to push on an urgency to treat these patients, many of whom have been treated for considerable time on ESAs.",0.3739716,0.904
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,124,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So those dynamics we think are very favorable and bode well for continued growth opportunities for us as we go into the second half of the year. And with respect to the XUS launches, say it's still very early days, but what we've seen is very good customer reception in early-launch markets like Germany.",1.1688466,0.785
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,125,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"The execution in those markets have been good. As COVID continues to improve there and we're able to engage with customers more, we see those dynamics continuing to improve over the course of the year. And then we have, of course, additional launches as access at this period, most notably with Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Italy in the coming months.",1.2667459,0.382

And for Iberdomide, the way I look at it is. there is a progression of how we move forward, and how we move up the line. If you recall, over the last couple of meetings at ASCO as as well as ASH, we've been able to show the overall profile for Iberdomide, because of it's tolerability, the combinability is good.",1.2290924,0.273
BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,127,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So we've been able to combine with Dara, we've been able to combine with KYPROLIS, as well as with Velcade.

You talked about a potential launch in the second half of next year. Is that a delay?

BMY-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,144,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So for Factor XIa, Steve, what -- when I say we got what we wanted is it was a multi-arm study where we looked at single daily dose as well as BID and it was a dose range. What we wanted from the study was to give us an inkling on, number 1, the safety profile that we were observing, as well as to see what is the goals that we should take to Phase 3.",0.2933016,-0.002

And plus, we wanted to see the therapeutic index overall, what dose range one can use in the future programs and that's what we got. Of course, you'll hear more as the data are presented later this year, but this is where we started off in the TTR study and that's what we got.",0.5124851,0.852

So that's what the good outcome would look like if we can actually manage that risk profile that is there, and that will then pave the way for taking it forward into indications that are to be discussed with our partners and of course, with the agencies in the future.",1.000994,0.944

We had a successful outcome, but also a part of the trial that didn't meet its endpoint. Starting with the results of Part 1a, this is the third major tumor in which Opdivo+Yervoy shows an overall survival benefit in the first-line setting.

First question is, results of 227, how do they influence, how you now look at the odds of success on Checkmate-9LA? Does that trial have CTLA component? I'm guessing you'd say the odds of success with that one have to be higher. Also, can I confirm that that trial stratifies by PD-L1 and not by TMB, which seem to make sense in light of the Part 1 findings.",1.1431677,0.882
BMY-2019-Q2-2019-07-25,51,Question,2019-07-25,2,2019,Tim Anderson,Prudential,"And the second question is on Part 1 itself. Just directionally, hoping you can see whether the magnitude of clinical benefit was the same in PD-L1 positive versus negative patients. It seems that across few different tumor types now, CTLA-4 combination may offer its greatest value in the PD-L1 negative segment where we know that PD-1s at least by themselves don't really seem to work.

But, I would also remind you that some of those measures only would come into effect in 2022, when we would be really, I would say, at the end of the lifecycle of that asset.

Let me start with Part 1. When we will show the data from Part 1, clearly, we will understand the performance of nivo and added benefit of Yervoy on top of nivo, very clearly.

I know, you can't go into specific numbers yet. But, do you feel you need to see an overall survival hazard ratio close to that seen with chemo Keynote-189 for this offering to be competitive, or should -- or are you more focused on those factors, like CR rates and depth of responses you think about what you need to be to find kind of role and a niche for that combo?",1.8861039,0.84

I would just add, this is a pattern that we have seen in other -- two other major cancers, in melanoma and in renal cell. For the question on 9LA crossover, the crossover is not systematic in 9LA, it was not systematic in 227.

Overall, as we said, we have seen clear benefit, clinically meaningful and statistically significant of Yervoy+Opdivo in the primary end of the study, which is in PD-1 positive. We have also seen good survival benefits in the PD-L1 negative. I think, the totality of the data will be seen. We're not going to comment on our interaction with health authorities.

And my question is, we know it's fully enrolled. And where is your expectation and how are you thinking about the trial? I also noticed it has a PFS primary endpoint, not an OS. So, I was curious to get your perspective on that. And then, secondly, it was helpful commentary on the market shares in various Opdivo indications. I was curious if you could give a bridge on a dollar basis on progression of sales from 1Q to 2Q, for Opdivo U.S. Thank you very much.",1.4749861,0.925

So, Q2 dynamics, Opdivo was down slightly about 1% in the U.S. And that's really a function of a few things. First, we continue to see pressure in second-line lung cancer, due to the decline in the overall opportunity. That's what I referenced previously around the percent of I-O eligible patients. What I will say though is within the pool of I-O eligible patients, we continue to hold a market share for Opdivo of around 40%. We've also seen some competitive impact in tumors outside of any discussion around lung cancer, notably in first line renal cell, and I referenced those previously. Again, they're in that market. I'm very proud that the team's holding share of roughly 30% to 35%. And the impact really of I-O TKI has been confined to favorable patients. And where they have gotten additional uptake outside of those favorable patients, has mainly come at the expense of monotherapy TKI.",2.0220643,0.827

So, as you will remember, we have two studies in our Phase 3 program for TYK2, and both studies are progressing rapidly through the enrollment period.

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"The only thing I would just add to that is we continue to be very excited about the profile of TYK2 and how it can play an important role in psoriasis. As you may recall, psoriasis is a debilitating disease, has very serious comorbidities, there's a considerable psychosocial cost associated with the disease. And based on what we've seen with TYK2, at least in the early days, we're seeing very good activity approaching biological efficacy with an easier mode of administration.

BMY-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,83,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So for example, you'll recall that when Zeposia was approved in late March, we decided to postpone that launch. We did so because at the time the healthcare system was really just bracing for the impact of COVID.

We've hired a very experienced medical and commercial team that's been fully in place frankly before launch. And we've gotten very good feedback on the Zeposia profile.

And then as conditions warrant, we'll be able to dial-up in personal promotion. And ultimately as we always do, we'll use a mix of both in-person and remote engagement to support those launches.

BMY-2020-Q1-2020-05-07,152,Answer,2020-05-07,1,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,Sure. I think that Samit stood on most of the points around 9LA. What I would say from a commercial standpoint is obviously we've had a lot of discussions with physicians over the last few months about 227 and 9LA. And it's important what Samit said that physicians and we really do think that 227 and 9LA really need to be thought about together.,0.2920718,0.477

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"227, you'll recall that what we showed was about 50% of responders were still responding at two years, and we saw this nice flattening of the OS curve. You'll see how that data matures at ASCO into few weeks. But then the way physicians are thinking about 9LA is very much as complimentary to 227.",0.3563949,0.752

And then I'll ask Samit to give you his perspective on the ongoing LAG3 program. I think you're point is really important. It is a very good question.

At the beginning of last year, I outlined a number of milestones that we believed would be important to our future, including opportunities to renew our portfolio and grow our business during the decade. I am pleased to report we've made great progress. We returned Opdivo's growth, successfully launched multiple new products and produced key expansion data sets for several assets.

And on Slide 6, you can see there are multiple catalysts ahead during 2022. The 2022 milestones include expected approvals and launches for 3 exciting first-in-class medicines: Mavacamten, deucravacitinib and relatlimab. We believe that all of this have the potential to further strengthen the commercial opportunity for our new product portfolio and support our growth outlook.

Eliquis continued to deliver extraordinary growth, with global sales up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the full year.

Fourth quarter revenues grew 1% globally versus prior year and grew 6% for the full year with sales of approximately $12.8 billion. As we enter into the first year of generic entry for Revlimid, I want to remind everyone of our expectations for Revlimid sales in 2022 and beyond.

For the first quarter, our best projection for global Revlimid sales is approximately $2.5 billion. Beyond '22 through 2025, although there's still uncertainty due to ongoing litigation, we view an annual stepdown of roughly $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year as a reasonable projection.",0.2668008,0.599

Sales were primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies in ex U.S. markets and fewer selling days in the U.S. We continue to expect growth for Pomalyst as treatments move to earlier lines of therapy and more triplet-based therapies are approved with longer duration of treatment. As it relates to U.S. IP for Pomalyst, we are pleased that there is now no outstanding litigation.

Having just covered sales performance, let me walk you through a few non-GAAP key line items. Operating expenses increased versus prior quarter due to timing of MS&A investments that shifted from -- to the fourth quarter, as noted in October. MS&A decreased versus prior year due to some incremental and accelerated investments to support our business in 2020. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was impacted by earnings mix.

Certainly, we, in our EXPLORER trial, have looked at the commonly used background therapies of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. In the VALOR trial, we do have patients who are going to be receiving the background therapy of disopyramide as well.

With respect to mava and how we think about the shape of the opportunity, I would think about it as more of a gradual opportunity. When we look at the way this launch will likely progress, it's very much going to be in a stepwise fashion. We expect that there will be strong interest in treating the most severe patients, particularly in the centers of excellence where these patients are being treated today.

As we've said previously, the supply constraints that we're seeing right now are mainly related to Abecma. And our efforts are really focused on working with CMOs to accelerate capacity for vector.

Cell therapy actually, I think, is a very, very good story. We've seen no issues with respect to access constraints for our cell therapy launches. We've discussed the supply constraints. But the launches have gone off really without a hitch from a supply -- from an access standpoint. And in fact, if you look at the class of agents more generally, if you go back a couple of years, as you well know, access and reimbursement were significant areas of concerns.

What I can say coming into 2022 is we have very broad formulary coverage for Zeposia. Now how restrictive that formulary coverage is, it varies by plan. And for the course of this year, for those patients with less restricted access, the focus is going to be on converting those patients from starter or bridge programs to commercial drug, and do so very quickly.

So as you think about our hematology sales force, being able to move those resources out of Revlimid and into like cell therapy with the Breyanzi and Abecma, we're able to use existing resources to support this launch brands and maintain our cost base where we are.

So as time goes, we will certainly be able to share more in terms of the filing and the PDUFA dates, et cetera. And we are certainly very, very pleased with the data that we have.",0.9564011,0.937
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,160,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"As well as that Breyanzi has a large development program. So additional trials are already ongoing in CLL, follicular lymphoma as well as for additional indications in indolent NHL. We're certainly looking forward to launching the second-line indication, as Chris mentioned earlier during the call, in that indication as well, in the second line of BCL.",1.0780816,0.772
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,161,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"For bempeg, certainly, it is data dependent. We are working with Nektar as well to read out these studies in melanoma as well as in renal cell and bladder cancer. Just as a reminder, these indications were chosen based on those Phase II data that we had seen early on. But each study stands on its own, and the data will dictate how we proceed further in terms of future development.",0.2647642,0.052
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,165,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Okay. I'll start off. So first of all, for Milvexian in terms of what amount of bleed is acceptable, look, it is all dependent. And certainly, we don't want to see any increase in bleed compared to the control arm. So that's how you have to compare and contrast. And we certainly have historical data from other therapies as well as how patients are treated today. So we'll have to put that into context as we look at Milvexian program. But there are no numbers that I can share today with you as to how to start looking at or projecting out those numbers.",0.216409,0.893
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,166,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"From the REMS perspective for mavacamten, once again, we are not going to get into specifics.

BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,167,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"We have to go back to what Chris talked about earlier, the basic mechanism of the drug for mavacamten is myosin inhibition. And we want to ensure that the patients are treated in a safe way so that we don't cause the heart to ""relax"" too much and decrease the ejection fraction. And that's the intent and the way the patients are currently managed on a continuous or ongoing basis, is periodic echocardiographies. So more to follow on that as we get to the PDUFA date and final approval and full package of REMS and overall NDA approval.",0.051526,0.908
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,168,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"From an Abecma perspective, certainly, the continuous progress in looking at the data from KarMMa and then KarMMa-3 and KarMMa-2 proof-of-concept this year will dictate the further evolution in terms of the overall development program.

BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,170,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. And maybe I'll just make one comment on the REMS program, Charlie. The way that we have approached the REMS, obviously, we knew a REMS would likely -- would be likely with this asset. We've worked very closely from a commercial standpoint with Samit's team to ensure that the nature of that REMS fits very nicely into how physicians treat patients. And so we don't anticipate that there will be any particular challenges associated with that as we go into the launch.",0.0560957,0.918
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,171,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And I think Samit's last point is particularly relevant as it relates to Abecma, which is that the way we've approached looking at clinical and commercial supply, is that, obviously, commercial supply is critically important. But it is equally important that we continue to prosecute our development program. And we're going to continue to make those trade-offs with both of those priorities in mind.",0.1817502,-0.026
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,175,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Sure. I can take both of those, Dane. Thank you. For mavacamten, we are looking forward to initiating the first Phase III study in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within 2022. And for HFpEF, the Phase II trial is now ongoing and looking forward to that proof-of-concept readout over time. And then that will dictate the future development in Phase III as well.",0.3579073,0.71

BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,180,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So let me start with deucravacitinib. So we've already got 2 Phase III studies that have read out. And those safety data are all the way with a follow-up of 52 weeks, we've already shared. And we'll to continue to evolve as we look forward. We've also looked at the data and will be part of the submissions in China and Japan for studies that have been conducted in China and Japan with longer term, 1 year follow-up.",0.0705509,0.637
BMY-2021-Q4-2022-02-04,181,Answer,2022-02-04,4,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So those are all in line with the safety profile that we have added. So we certainly do not look forward to doing additional analyses on the same data because we've conducted those. Long-term follow-ups will continue and see additional evolution. And certainly, those similar sorts of exercises of continuing to generate data at higher doses for other indications that we are studying will be evaluated when data are available.",0.0356718,0.8

So James, as I said earlier, we do expect that there's going to continue to be an evolution of JAK labeling that could continue to push those assets into later lines of therapy, if you will. From our perspective, we continue to be very happy with the profile from Zeposia, both from an efficacy, given the strong clinical remissions, as well as the clean safety profile.",0.2666417,0.951

At the start of the year, I laid out this scorecard with the milestones we thought would be important for us to deliver in order to successfully renew our portfolio. The team has worked hard, and I'm proud that we're making progress across the board. A number of accomplishments were included on the prior slide, so I won't go through all the details. But I want to call out a few highlights here. David will provide more details in his remarks. I'll start with Deucravacitinib. Deucrava has demonstrated a compelling and differentiated profile in two Phase 3 studies and the oral treatment of choice in psoriasis.

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So let me shed some light on some of our product performance, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. Eliquis continues to perform very strongly with global sales up 15% versus prior year. In U.S., sales grew 18% versus prior year. Demand growth continues to be strong with total prescription growth of 14% versus last year, driven by à la carte market share gains and growth in new-to-brand volumes. Sequentially, as usual, sales were impacted by the expected coverage gap liability that occurs in the third and fourth quarters each year.",0.9814889,0.612

We remain really pleased with Eliquis' execution around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis' share within a growing class.",0.3927565,0.958
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,24,Remarks,2021-10-27,3,2021,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now moving to Opdivo's performance on Slide 10. We are pleased with the continued momentum for the brand, with sales growth of 7% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 4% versus last year, primarily driven by uptake in first-line lung cancer and our multiple other new launches this year. And sequentially, we had demand growth of 5%, which was offset by work down a $40 million in inventory build we noted in the second quarter. Our commercial teams continued to execute well. We've retained strong positions in core indications such as melanoma and renal and are very pleased with the performance of our newer indications. Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter, with sales up 11% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand for new indications and expanded access in Latin America, Turkey and Russia.",1.1171026,0.902

REVLIMID was up 11% globally, primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. Pomalyst global sales were up 10% driven by continued demand for triple based therapies and use in earlier lines. Now moving to our new products on Slide 12, we continue to be very pleased with our new products which generate sales of 344 million in the third quarter. This new diversified portfolio is already annualizing close to $1.5 billion run rate, giving us great confidence that we're on our way to renewing our business with products that are much earlier in their lifecycle.

We're very encouraged by the recent NCCN guideline update that now recommends evaluating ESA response sooner at 6 to 8 weeks instead of the previously recommended 12 to 16 weeks. This supports need to monitor and potentially treat new patients earlier in their treatment journey. Additionally, we remain focused on ensuring they received the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit. Outside the U.S., uptake continues to be strong in countries where Reblozyl is launched. Sales were impacted by the usual price review, one year after launch in Germany. We expect to launch in Italy and the Netherlands in Q4 pending reimbursement discussions, and in more countries in 2022 to drive additional growth for the brand.",0.9933731,0.961

Demand for Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR T, remains robust. We generate 71 million in the third quarter versus 24 million in the second quarter. Remember that 2Q revenues consisted of only 1.5 months of sales having launched in mid-May, so performance this quarter reflects a full quarter of sales. Demand continues to exceed supply, and we expect Q4 revenues to be largely similar to Q3. Now moving to our CD19 CAR T Breyanzi, sales in the quarter were 30 million versus 17 million in the prior quarter. Sales increased due to patient demand with physicians recognizing Breyanzi best-in-class profile.",1.2292909,0.778

Turning to Zeposia, global revenues were 40 million in the quarter driven by multiple sclerosis launch, and one-time inventory build in the U.S. The MS launch continues to progress well, where Zeposia remains the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions.

We're encouraged by the initial uptake and growth in the number of new trailers since launch in June. Our focus is building on volume, establishing demand for this oral biologic-like medicine, while broadening access over time. We're also very pleased to have just received CHMP positive opinion in Europe. And look forward to making Zeposia available to patients living with UC as soon as possible. Lastly, we're making progress on establishing Onureg and first-line maintenance and AML patients.

Now let's turn our attention over to P&L on Slide 13. We've already covered our strong sales for the quarter so let me walk you through a few other non-GAAP key line items. Gross margin increase versus prior year primarily due to lower royalty payments. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in R&D due to COVID recovery, but also slightly in MS&A due to investment supporting our launch and pre -launch activities.",0.328721,0.812

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"MS&A versus prior quarter did experience some softness due to the timing of investments that have shifted to the fourth quarter. Our Effective Tax Rate of 14.9% was primarily driven by earnings mix. Overall, non-GAAP EPS increased 23% year-over-year. Now moving to our Balance Sheet and capital allocation on Slide 14, our liquidity position remains strong with almost $16 billion in cash and marketable securities, and a strong cash flow from operations of 5.3 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have significant financial flexibility to support a balanced approach to capital allocation.",0.3582648,0.973

We've executed several business development deals this year, bringing in differentiated early-stage assets. Business development remains a top priority as a leading innovation-based Company.

We continue to expect revenues to increase at the higher end of our guidance and gross margin to be approximately 80%. Moving to operating expenses, we are maintaining our MS&A and R&D guidance for the year.

I just wanted to ask on the new launches, the Abecma launch was pretty good. Just give us a sense for how much of that is still bolus of patients versus underlying demand and this also helped us with the impact that you are still seeing from the viral vector manufacturing.",0.6845026,0.952
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,41,Question,2021-10-27,3,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,And then the second question just on Opdivo. It was flat sequentially. And how do you view going into 2022 with respect to -- what indications could be more of a tipping point versus others? Thank you very much.,0.301625,0.465
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,42,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you, Geoff. Thanks for the questions. This is Giovanni. Let me just start with a couple of comments and then I'll ask Chris to answer both of your questions. I just wanted to step back and really think about cell therapy. And you'll remember in the past, we've had a number of discussions about whether cell therapy treatments would have a fast uptake in the marketplace whether this market would grow over time. There were concerns with payers' willingness to provide coverage for those therapies.",0.1252477,-0.251
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,43,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I must say, when I look at the experience that we've had with both Abecma and Breyanzi, it really confirms our belief that given the right treatments with the right efficacy and safety profile, there is tremendous willingness of physicians to prescribe and drive increased adoption in the marketplace, many of the payer dynamics have been resolved. So, beyond, obviously, the question that Chris will answer as we look at the medium and the long-term and the commitment we've made to a broad cell therapy portfolio, I'm very reassured that the commercial potential of this modality is being recognized, I would say, significantly more than in the past, Chris?",0.5453943,0.44
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,44,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So thanks for the questions, Geoff. Let me start with cell therapy. So we're very pleased with the performance really of both Abecma and Breyanzi. In the quarter, we saw a very nice increase in demand for both products. There was some bolus for Abecma still reflected in these numbers, but the underlying demand for that product looks very strong, the same is true with Breyanzi. We're very happy with the commercial execution for both of these products. We now have over 70 accounts that have been activated across both products. And the majority of those accounts have been or plan to imminently use one or both of the cell therapy products.",0.5179506,0.641
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,45,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So overall, I would say the commercial performance continues to be very good. As has been mentioned already, we are actively managing the supply constraints of those mainly are impacting Abecma. And as David mentioned in his remarks, we do anticipate that Abecma sales in the fourth quarter are going to be roughly similar to what we saw in the third quarter. And we are, of course, continuing to stay very focused on managing through the vector supply constraints. I mean, anticipated being in a much better position on that front as we get into the second half of next year. But, again, stepping back, as Giovanni just mentioned, we're very happy with what we're seeing in the marketplace on cell therapy and it confirms the opportunity we have to build a strong position here.",0.8915482,0.844
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,46,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"With respect to Opdivo, the performance for the quarter for I-O was really in line with expectations. We saw very strong double-digit growth relative to same time last year. And while sales were flat, as you know, from Q2 into Q3, that was, as David mentioned, a function of inventory dynamics coming out of the second quarter.",0.6877337,0.796
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,47,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"What is important here, is that we had very solid growth in the quarter. We had solid growth relative to same time last year and quarter-over-quarter. And that growth was in the key tumors that are going to drive near and medium-term growth for the I-O Franchise. Notably in gastric cancer, where we've seen a nice uptake since the approval in April; in renal cell cancer, we continue to see very strong demand; and we've seen coming at the end of the quarter some nice growth in first-line lung cancer. So overall, if you step back, we were very confident not only in the continued growth for Opdivo this year, but importantly, the momentum going into '22.",1.2150431,0.824

I just wanted to get a little bit of a better sense. It just seems -- I was surprised to see that we don't have Deucravacitinib listed as filed yet. Just don't know what the limitations are. Are there new data being added or that you plan to be added? Or is it just simply waiting for FDA's acceptance of the filing?",1.0941021,0.906
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,51,Question,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second question really is, as we think about the opportunity for Deucravacitinib, I wanted to just get a better understanding of what Bristol believes is necessary to succeed in ulcerative colitis. It's our understanding that the IT-9D may, in fact, be the most critical part of the development plan. And that perhaps Deucravacitinib may not achieve that unless the dose is really pushed.

So we will certainly make you aware and everyone aware when we hear as time goes.

BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,56,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On the question on ulcerative colitis, you're right in the sense that the dose required in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or IBD in general, is going to be 2 to 3 times higher than what we see for psoriasis and we've seen that for other molecules as well. And that is the intent of the ongoing trials, to test out these doses. We obviously have not shared exactly what doses are being pursued for confidential reasons and competitive reasons. But we are looking at all avenues in terms of looking at the impact from not only PK, but the PD outcomes as well and we'll continue to follow those.

As you know, these are in the Phase 2A, Phase 2B settings, where we have multiple indications being pursued in BTK in the same trial in the autoimmune space, S1P1 also. Additional work being done in Crohn's disease, for example, for Zeposia and for MK2 as well, data is evolving.

Is May 1st -- there's been a lot of debate on the rate of Revlimid erosion in '22. I know you're not giving guidance for next year. But just any color you can provide there both U.S. and international dynamics and maybe specifically on the international side of the business. Is it reasonable thing about the businesses down like 50% for next year, given the LOEs you're facing or you're thinking of something much better or worse than that? It just again, one of the things that I think we all have eroding over time, but I think just any color on the rate of erosion would be much appreciated.",1.8394768,0.586
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,61,Question,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then the second question is a bigger picture one. You've been steadily rebuilding the portfolio here, but you've had a stock that that's underperformed this year. I think the Street remains concerned on some of these longer-term LOEs. Does that at some point lead to, I guess, a more aggressive deployment of your capital? I mean, that's a step-up in BD, you look at larger -- maybe later-stage deals, or even going the other direction with more aggressive share repo. I'm sharing your sense of when you look at what I think you would think of as a disconnect between what's fundamentally happened with your business and the stock price. How do you kind of think about it starting to address that? Thanks very much.",1.1040424,0.0
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,62,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Chris. Let me take your questions here, Giovanni. So first of all, on Revlimid generic entries, nothing has changed there and let me just reiterate what we've said before and what we see happening next year. So next year, we will begin to see a volume limited generic competition in the U.S.. And at the same time, we expect to see generic entries for REVLIMID EX-U.S.. That's consistent with what has always been our understanding, it has not changed, it has been fairly clear in our filings and we're preparing for that. The second thing that I would like to say is that if you remember beginning at JPMorgan, we clearly articulated on how we think about the Company, during the period of loss of exclusivity for Revlimid and Pomalyst.",1.5033135,0.226
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,63,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we expect to be able to grow the Company In fact, we've articulated low-to-mid single-digit for the total Company and low double-digit for our continuing business through 2025. And when we provided that perspective, we obviously were reflecting our understanding of the Revlimid erosion. And I think the conviction that we have that we can continue to grow the Company is really driven by the belief which is proving right that the combination of strong growth from our in-line products and namely, Opdivo and Eliquis, combined with the strong uptake of our launch brands, which is happening would more than offset the loss of exclusivity of Revlimid internationally next year and then over time in the U.S.",0.8568588,0.727
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,64,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So what I'm not going to give you exactly a percentage of erosion for next year, and we definitely will have an opportunity to talk more about this when we eventually provide guidance for the year. What I can tend to you is that our belief remains strong and I think that our perspective that we're able to grow sales and earnings per share applies to next year as well. And so nothing has really changed there. Now, with respect to your second question that speaks to what are our priorities as we renew the portfolio in the face of LOEs, First of all, I think we have a rapidly evolving portfolio of new medicines that has tremendous potential, where we're executing multiple launches well.",1.4082174,0.0
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,65,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And I think our priority is always going to be first to maximize the opportunities that we have in a very, very reached late-stage pipeline. At the same time, we have tremendous financial flexibility as David said. And obviously, we've seen for - - we've said for some time now that business development is a priority for us as we think about allocating capital. And that continues to be the case, at the same time as I've said before, we will be disciplined as we think about the BD. because we do have many opportunities to deploy our capital to accelerate growth.

And looking at share repurchases year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 billion. We have an existing authorization for another 3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well.

For LAG-3, the overall survival data of course, is dependent on the events. We're going to continue to follow them and we'll share the data once available through our medical conference, but certainly I'll make you aware of it. We have to remember though, that in I-O therapies, more important than those hazard ratios are going to be the shape of the curve and we're going to continue to watch out for that.

And then I know it's a bit of a sensitive topic given some of the ongoing litigation, but just maybe how you're thinking about sort of the backup tick 2 compounds you have in your portfolio.

BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,96,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yeah. So we feel very good about the performance that we're seeing for as the Posey. And you see, and let me start with execution. The execution of the team really, since approval, has been very strong. We've got very good awareness for the product. The unaided awareness now is over 60%, aided awareness is well over 90% since approval. And you see we estimate that we have around 400 trialist that have already begun to utilize the product. Virtually all of the gastros that we survey who are aware of the Posey are interested in trying it. Frankly, in spite of a still relatively restricted access environment, the sales teams are having very good success in engaging with customers both in-person and remotely.",0.5153328,0.941

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So from an execution standpoint, early days, but we feel very good about where we are. As you note, access is going to be -- continue to be something we pay a lot of attention to. We feel good about our ability to start generating volume this year and into the first part of next year. And we think that volume will build momentum as we get into the second half of 2022 when we begin to get additional, more favorable access with key payers.

Before I ask Samit to comment on the Ducrava dose, let me just say, Carter, we're not going to comment on any ongoing litigation. I just want to say that that litigation is really not related at all to the BMS Program or any backup that may exist.

And just as a minor thing to add over here is, as we talk about the doses, without getting into the specifics of it, I can tell you that we selected the doses which are higher than what we use in the Sciences Program based on PK modeling and taking into account the historical experience. We will certainly say that we are at this point, we don't know if these higher doses will translate into efficacy or not. That's the proof-of-concept we're trying to get and once that is available, that will certainly pave the way for the future program, we will need to see what the data are from the next trials that we're pursuing right now, both in Crohn's disease as well as an ulcerative colitis.",0.1518325,0.709

There has been some debate about the approvability of full-on PD-1, with data from Asian populations only. You've obviously generated a lot of data in various populations. I was wondering if there is any scientific basis to this concern that is in your trials, is there a difference in either efficacy or safety in different ethnic populations with your PD-1? And second on Washington we had a discussion around price reform in the drug area.",0.7730285,0.44
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,104,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Ronnie, let me just start there and then I'll ask Samit to comment on your question about PD-1 development. So let me just start by saying that it's really difficult to forecast at this point what price reform. look like in the future. from my perspective, what's important is that any change that is made actually improves affordability of medicines for patients. And that's the lens that we are applying. And from that perspective, there are a number of elements -- of potential reform like establishing out-of-pocket caps in part the redesign of the product these benefit to reduce to reduce the exposure of patients that we support.",1.2534791,0.956
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,105,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we also support some changes, like introducing market forces in Part B. Very difficult to answer your question with respect to whether a disproportionate impact may happen in oncology or not? I think what's important is that we don't go to reforms that actually impact the ability of the industry overall to continue to invest in innovation. That's the primary primer lens here. I think from the perspective of the MBS portfolio, when you look at our portfolio, it's actually very diversified across therapeutic areas, across actually Part B versus Part D.",1.3028496,0.422
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,106,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And so I can't speculate what the impact of any reform would be on us. I think what's really important is to continue to advocate for reforms that yes, improve affordability of medicines for patients but at the same time, enable us to continue to invest in innovation and some of the hyper partisan scenarios being discussed in Washington would actually impact both negatively.",0.7411811,0.636
BMY-2021-Q3-2021-10-27,107,Answer,2021-10-27,3,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Yeah. And just starting from where you left off in terms of the portfolio, we have a very broad portfolio which means that when we conduct our clinical trials, we do them globally. Including those in the Asian countries. And when we file the data, we have to provide subset analysis by region or sometimes even by country. And that's how we seek approval in some of the regions and countries in the world, including in Asia. As it comes to the PD-1 inhibitors, where we have conducted clinical trials globally and across the 20 yard indications our 12-plus tumor types that have now start approvals.",0.9948474,0.742

That doesn't mean that representation of larger populations may not be required in clinical trials.

We have -- we don't anticipate that any potential change. on the Tecfidera would have an impact on us. We've seen very limited competitive impact of generic Tecfidera that's predominantly been cannibalization of branded tech and then obviously a shift in the utilization within that portfolio. Our focus on Zeposia in the EMEA side continues to be not only establishing ourselves as the number one SP, which we are right now in terms of written scripts, but also becoming the number one oral.

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And let me just give the commercial perspective on the second-line CAR T setting, and then I'll turn it over to Samit. When you look at that second-line setting, generally, you generally see that population divert into those physicians who tend to be very focused on transplant. There's a sort of defined segment of those physicians. There are a number of physicians who are very open and look for opportunities to avoid transplant where possible, and then there are a number of physicians who really take it on a case-by-case basis. And so we're excited about the data that we've seen so far, And look forward to seeing that data continue to play out and be presented at ASH.

And BFS in this particular case is accepted endpoint from a regulatory perspective. So looking forward to certainly getting engagement with the agency and getting this again to the patients as soon as possible. We will obviously continue to follow patients for overall survival. And as is required for cards and therapies long-term safety follow-up as well. So those data will evolve and will be shared in the future at the current time, the primary endpoint of this study was BFS, and we have that in hand and that will be presented.",1.4498613,0.273

Thank you, Steve, for your questions and some starting with Lupus as you know, that we will first of all, we get the data for our Deucravacitinib at the beginning of next year, we have a Discord Lupus study that is also ongoing, which will readout in 23 or later part of that, we have a couple of other assets and early developments which are on controls.gov, which we have ongoing studies looking at Lupus as well.

And there are two things to really takeaway. One, the intent of the study was to define a range of those that will be pursued for future evaluation in Phase 3, once the data from SSP study is also available, so that collective data set then leads to the decision-making for future exploration in indications as we go forward. Second, we wanted to see a differentiation in terms of not only efficacy, but very importantly from a safety and bleeding risk perspective.",0.3717796,0.392

I'll just reiterate what I said earlier that from our perspective, as we think about the period of loss of exclusivity of Revlimid -- first of all, we always said that our perspective or the particular in the U.S. there will be a slope that will be happening over time. We've made a comment in the past, we were more conservative on that slope than consensus. At the same time, we believe strongly in the fact that the growth of the Line portfolio and the launch brands will actually enable the Company to grow through that period.

And there's a couple of things driving that. One is, I discussed earlier, we're doing better on our synergies and strong execution against that as we head into next year and the run rate after that. To the others, we've been very disciplined on the P&L side of things and you may note from an MS&A perspective, we're very efficient and top-tier in our industry. And the other thing I would say is that we've been very disciplined from the standpoint of reallocating resources from those low brands to our launch brands, which gives us further confidence in.",0.7758551,

Those products have nice margins as well. So, that's what gives us confidence in our ability to keep those operating margins in that load to mid-40s as we progress.",0.9118712,

With CheckMate-227 we've learned that dual I-O offers a unique potential for long-term survival in first-line lung cancer. Physicians have told us that the depth and durability of response is important. And we saw a clear contribution of parts when comparing Opdivo+Yervoy to Opdivo monotherapy in PD-L1 expressors.

And then if I might quick for Sumit. You said, 9LA follow-up was relatively short. KEYNOTE-189 hit with a median of 10 to 11 months, should we assume something similar for 9LA? Thank you.",0.86337,0.876
BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,103,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","Yes. Thanks, Steve. So in regard to just giving some perspective on the combined P&L. There has been some analysts who weren't modeling, particularly as we think about stock-based compensation in particular. So we wanted to get to be a little bit more specific, how we're going to handle it in addition to how we think about the share count. So I think that's fair. In regard to the fourth quarter, there's a number of things at play. If you think of the sales related to the business as we've talked about before we sold the UPSA business in July. The ELIQUIS donut hole continues to get slightly larger, as we think about the fourth quarter. And we've talked about -- we've already talked on this call a little bit of the Opdivo flattening in -- as we got into the third and fourth quarter. That coupled with -- historically we always have more OpEx in the business as we -- in the fourth quarter.",0.7346939,0.926

Of course, we will not compare this trial at this time to any other including KEYNOTE-189.

BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,107,Question,2019-10-31,3,2019,Umer Raffat,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question and I appreciate you bearing with me on this two questions. First, there's been confusion in the marketplace on your ongoing ELIQUIS patent litigation, specifically as it relates to whether the salt forms are appropriately tied in the written description of the patent or not. My question is given that there is MI on the chemical structure, isn't it fairly straightforward for a regular chemist to be able to make a salt form of ELIQUIS? And secondly, I want to touch up on the LAG-3 trial readout in melanoma for second half 2020. I realize this topic doesn't come up very much on the calls. My question is, I know there's a randomized Phase II and a Phase III component of this trial, has there been a readout of the randomized Phase II internally? And is there anything we can learn from that? Thank you very much.",1.6347971,0.713
BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,108,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Umer. Let me just answer your question on the ELIQUIS pattern first. So a couple of things. First of all we feel very good about the IP position for ELIQUIS. You may remember there were about two dozen challenges to the IP of ELIQUIS over 20 generic companies have already settled with us and I think that speaks to the strength of our IP position. They are a small number of generic companies that are continuing to challenge the patent. There has been some news regarding the fact that there was an out of order witness that testified in the last couple of days. That was really a scheduling issue the trial really starts today. And I can just say we feel very good about the fact that we have a strong patent estate for ELIQUIS. Samit on...",0.3101392,0.949
BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,109,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you, Giovanni. In terms of the LAG-3 trial as you know it is a trial looking at a combination of LAG-3 plus nivolumab versus nivolumab in the first-line metastatic setting for melanoma. It's a seamless Phase II/III study. So we have not seen the data. The trial continues to enroll patients in the study. And as you already pointed out our data will be available towards the end of 2020. So we'll be able to communicate at that time.",0.5005945,0.361
BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,114,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you for the question. Maybe, I can take the first one in terms of the future trials and how we think about I-O and the chemo and sequencing. At the current time, we don't have trials that are looking at the sequencing of chemotherapy followed by I-O or I-O followed by chemotherapy, as such.",0.804175,0.361
BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,115,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But certainly it's an idea that we may explore in the future with the new trials that we will be planning and looking at. And second and third generation I-O compounds yet to be developed in the future, but there are no registration trials that we have at this time that we're looking to this sequencing.",0.7286282,-0.273

So with respect to U.S. versus ex-U.S, we continue to see opportunities to grow the business outside of the U.S. and that's based really on a couple of things.

BMY-2019-Q3-2019-10-31,118,Answer,2019-10-31,3,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So, in all three of those cases, it's really a function of the decline in the eligible population in later lines where we have the bulk of our business today. We talked at length about the situation in second-line lung cancer with approvals of I-O agents in first-line, continuing to decrease the eligible pool in second line. That same dynamic has played out, or is playing out, in head and neck with competitor approvals earlier this year in first-line and in small cell with Roche's recent approval in a first-line setting.",0.4237098,0.542

Again, it's a function of the declining eligible pool in those markets.",0.4244577,0.778

Commercial performance was strong, with sales increasing 10% compared to pro forma sales for the same period in the prior year, and we made significant progress to advance our pipeline. Of note, we continued to make progress with our launches, including good momentum for Opdivo + Yervoy in first-line lung, which supports our confidence in a return to growth of Opdivo this year; Reblozyl, which has seen a strong launch with rapid adoption in MDS; Zeposia, which is well positioned as the S1P modulator of choice in multiple sclerosis; and Onureg, which is the only oral option with an overall survival benefit in first-line AML response maintenance.

The integration of Celgene has gone very well. Based on progress last year, we now expect total synergies to be close to $3 billion by the end of '22.

Overall, we are in a strong position to unlock the potential of the company we planned to build when we acquired Celgene. We're building a company with a younger, more diversified portfolio of medicines, better positioned in the second half of the decade. Let me remind you when we believe we are heading. We are confident we can more than offset the impact of near-term patent expiries, including Revlimid. We expect to grow our revenue and earnings through 2025, with low to mid-single-digit revenue CAGR for 2025 driven by the significant growth potential of our continuing business, which is comprised of our in-line growth drivers and our launch brands. We see strong momentum for this portfolio, which excludes Revlimid and Pomalyst, with low double-digit revenue CAGR during the same period. Looking out to 2025, we expect the continuing business will represent approximately 90% of the company, with 30% of that revenue from our newly launched products.",1.5798542,0.943

We have multiple sources of portfolio renewal. Our recently launched products will continue to grow. Most have significant expansion opportunities beyond the launch indication. We have a rich mid- to late-stage pipeline, with assets such as our Factor XIa inhibitor and our multiple myeloma CELMoDs, iberdomide and CC-92480. We will continue to advance our diverse early R&D portfolio and further invest in business development opportunities, just as we have done with MyoKardia.

If you turn to Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our robust top line performance for the quarter. Our teams continued to operate well in a virtual environment, delivering very strong quarterly and full year results. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 10% on a pro forma basis versus prior year, reflecting strong execution across the world. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $250 million of favorable inventory build versus the third quarter, primarily driven by Eliquis and Revlimid as well as a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange.

Global sales continued to perform very well, growing double digit for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 6% versus prior year, driven by robust 17% TRx growth and an inventory build partially offset by expected higher gross to net impact from the coverage gap.

Pomalyst global pro forma revenues continue to reflect significant growth, up 21%. In the U.S., pro forma revenues increased 18% and internationally up 27%, driven by increased usage in earlier lines and longer treatment durations.

You'll see we continue to generate a significant amount of cash flow from operations of approximately $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $16 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Business development remains a top priority. We're committed to reducing our debt and returning capital to shareholders.,1.1110664,0.772

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As it relates to reducing debt, we will continue to be focused on this, further strengthening our ability to invest for growth. This morning, we announced a debt reduction transaction of up to $4 billion. Based upon the bonds we are targeting, we still expect to see our leverage ratio reduce by 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA in '24. Importantly, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating, which is apparent through our willingness to use excess cash to proactively accelerate debt reduction.",0.3557344,0.927

Let me start by giving a quick update on our synergies. As Giovanni mentioned, the integration has gone very well, and we increased our total expected synergies to approximately $3 billion by the end of '22. We achieved about $1.4 billion in 2020 and expect the remaining synergy capture to be split evenly through this year and in '22. With that in mind and considering the momentum we saw in the business in 2020, we have increased our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for 2021.",1.0084507,0.79

In 2020, we had the opportunity to make a number of incremental and accelerated investments to support our prioritized brands and product launches. Also, with COVID recovery and higher expenses due to MyoKardia are reflected. For 2021, we expect MS&A to increase in the low single digit as we invest in our launches and include the full year spend for MyoKardia. We expect mid-single-digit increase in R&D as we invest behind a robust pipeline, COVID recovery plans in preclinical and clinical studies and incorporate spend of MyoKardia. We expect our tax rate to remain about 16%.

It's likely we'll see [indiscernible] income and net interest expense to roughly offset each other in 2021, resulting in net neutral OI&E.

Just want to get your thoughts on safety and tolerability. Not having a black box will obviously be a big commercial driver, but it's possible that recent safety data for Xeljanz and a somewhat related mechanism could directly impact you guys. I want to get your thoughts on that.",1.3885565,0.948

Let me start with the question on the tipping point and then also your question with respect to liso-cel. And maybe I'll start with the question on liso-cel and how we're thinking about the launch there. We're obviously very excited about the opportunity to launch liso-cel in DLBCL. We expect that imminently. We are obviously going to be very much focused on ensuring at launch that sites are activated very quickly, that we're able to get patients efficiently moved on to therapy.",1.4405385,0.875

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And then as we stated repeatedly, really, the tipping point with respect to Breyanzi is going to be our ability to continue to expand the CAR-T market by driving referrals and expanding the site footprint and then ultimately being able to leverage what we believe to be a differentiated product profile in order to drive brand share. And so that's going to be very important.",1.1910995,0.972

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And a similar story will be for ide-cel, where obviously, we have a very strong position in multiple myeloma to leverage. With respect to staying in hematology of the 3 products that were on the slide, Reblozyl. Obviously, Reblozyl is off to a very good start. We're very pleased with the launch so far. The execution for this probably has gone very well, and we continue to believe Reblozyl is going to play a very important role in both MDS and beta thalassemia. As we look at where the launch is at this point, we think thus far, we've had very good demand. Some of that demand, frankly, has been pent-up.

As David mentioned, there remains a very high unmet need for patients in first-line AML who've achieved a CR post-intensive chemo but aren't candidates for stem cell.

The MS launch, we think, is going well. In spite of the situation with COVID, we've seen good uptake from physicians in terms of willingness to prescribe. Importantly, the percentage of physicians who now believe that Zeposia is the best S1P is very much on track with what we had hoped for. And given the data that we saw with True North, we think there's considerable opportunity for us to drive business there as well. So very excited about the opportunity with Zeposia.

Let me just start first by saying that for [indiscernible] deucravacitinib, this is not a JAK inhibitor. And the reason I'd say that is because of the specificity and selectivity in terms of targeting TYK2, downstream inhibition of IL-12/23 and intracranial alpha, which leads to a profile that is differentiated. We do not see the signals of lab abnormalities that are generally associated with JAK inhibitors. We do not see the signals for VTEs that are generally associated with JAK inhibitors.",0.5877923,0.875

We are very pleased with the data that we've seen, meeting the primary and secondary endpoints.

First, on Opdivo, Chris, was just wondering if you can help us think about the cadence of contribution from some of the new approvals, CheckMate 9ER. And then maybe on the adjuvant side, when we could start seeing some pull-through there? Is this more the growth going to be weighted to the second half of the year? And then on Factor XIa, Samit, maybe you could just opine here on kind of what you're hoping to see on the profile from the initial Phase II trial later this year?",1.1174271,0.921

Again, as we talked about, we've got an established footprint with Opdivo + Yervoy there, and we think that by giving us the opportunity to combine with what we believe to be a best-in-class TKI with CABO, there's opportunity to grow that business, particularly as we think about getting into the favorable patient population.

For Factor XIa, we expect to have the data from the first of the two proof-of-concept studies that are ongoing, the first one being in the total knee replacement population.

BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,61,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So what we are trying to see is the profile that emerges from a bleeding perspective, whether we can have a similar or better efficacy with less bleeding. More importantly then, there will be the second study next year looking at a combination to the background therapy of the anti-platelet agents where, again, it is very important to note that, that profile, what impact it will have on bleeding? And if we are able to combine, then it opens up additional indications that we can pursue going forward. So those are the 2 things that we'll be watching out for defining the dose, looking at the safety and, of course, efficacy will also be a point of review.",0.6619104,0.0

Will Bristol conduct a large long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial to fully convince physicians that there is no CV risk? And if not, why not? Bristol's view is clear but prescribers don't seem convinced. And then on Opdivo, does Bristol see any risk from potential new PD-1 entrants such as Lilly's Tyvyt or Novartis' tislelizumab or now the [indiscernible] coherus antibody? I assume their primary angle will be price. So what is the risk from that?",0.2770511,0.103

So we have just had the readout of the first Phase III studies in psoriasis. Certainly, data will continue to evolve as we look at the long-term extension studies from psoriasis. We will continue to follow these. We have additional indications ongoing.

We'll have the discussions with the prescribers, with the health authorities in order to understand what profile is that we need to further investigate. This is not a commercialized drug yet, so in terms of talking about whether the prescribers are convinced or not, I think that is still -- got to be further evaluated, then we are able to present the data and share that profile fully with the community and their perspective with the data in hand.

Giovanni, we're continuing to see a lot of activity on the BD front from your team. As we think about the next sort of leg of opportunities, are you most focused on sort of Phase II/III opportunities and again, continuing to build out the pipeline in that regard?

This is Samit and let me just start with the R&D aspect of multiple myeloma strategy. And then certainly, Chris can fill in the commercial aspects of it. So as you know, beyond the MS, there are 4 classes of medicines that are being developed in multiple myeloma, primarily: cell therapies; certainly, the ADC that has recently been approved and more to follow; there are the CELMoDs, and then they are going to be the combinations as we have also talked about.",0.319461,0.474

We are trying to transform that disease. So from that perspective, cell therapies are going to play a major role, and that's where ide-cel is coming in to begin with, where we have shown the data.

T cell engagers are going to be also very important. And as we've spoken about earlier, there could be patients who may not be able to receive cell therapies and would be more appropriate in terms of being treated through the T cell engagers. Of course, there are challenges right now with the formulations that we have available. We've seen data from multiple companies coming up, showing that IV administration is associated -- while with good efficacy, there are challenges in terms of finding the right dose of administration schedule from a safety perspective.

So those are the strategies moving forward in the earlier line. We are, in a similar way, going to be investigating combinations with ide-cel. And as the data evolves, the T cell engager, we'll look for combinations. The ultimate goal is to move CELMoDs in much earlier line so that we can have the comparisons versus image to be able to ultimately replace them in the longer run, and then, of course, try to move the other modalities also further up in line. But ultimately, yes, there will be segmentation of patients.

The only thing I would add is, obviously, as Revlimid and Pomalyst go generic, our focus is going to continue to be on bringing transformational opportunities forward. As you well know, Seamus, there continues to be considerable unmet need, particularly for patients, as they get into later lines of therapy in multiple myeloma.

BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,85,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Chris, let me -- I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to others to comment on the second part of your question. So with respect to the opportunity that we have with TYK and sort of the pace of the commercial execution, look, I think we're excited about the opportunity that we have here. We think that based on the data we've seen from the Phase II as well as both PSO 1 and 2, we have the opportunity to establish TYK as the frontline branded oral of choice for these patients.",1.7539267,0.946
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,88,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And Chris, just to be very, very short because we know the time is short here and others also have questions, we do believe that both studies have individually very important role to play: to define the dose and the safety profile. The time difference being the readout of those studies is not too long. So I think we will obviously be able to build development plans based out of the first study. Execution will probably take into account both studies. But as I said, the time difference you can readout is not that long. So execution-wise, both data sets will be important.",0.1466508,0.0

Largest product now for the company, goes off-patent next year. Analysts are guessing how to erode it in the first year. We don't know if it's $1 billion or $3 billion down or what exactly. And it'd be great to have some clarity on how to think about first year erosion.",1.2080848,0.869
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,93,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I would agree that from a NRDL perspective, it is appropriate to be cautious because of the number of PD-1 agents that have been launched at the same time, including the number of local players. And so I share the perspective that the opportunity in China, I would be cautious about. I do believe, though, in a couple of things. So first of all, there are examples of brands in oncology and other therapeutic areas that recently have had a more differentiated profile with fewer local competitors have been able to be included in NRDL reimbursement and built to be meaningful contributors to growth in the market. So I don't think every therapeutic area is the same and every class of drug is the same.",2.5013254,0.549
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,95,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I do see that in the medium term, the composition, if you want, of the marketplace in China in terms of payer dynamics will be more diversified.

BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,96,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"With respect to your question on Revlimid, you -- as you can imagine, we have a number of discussions ongoing. We have litigations along with players that are continuing. We're not going to be in a position to provide multiple year guidance going into the future. But I think we've been pretty clear in articulating our position on the Revlimid erosion beginning in '22. And as we've mentioned, we see the LOE portfolio of Revlimid and Pomalyst representing no more, in fact, less than 10% of the company by 2025. So the evolution of that business, I think it's pretty clear. And from my perspective, what's more important is to really look at the potential for double-digit growth for our continuing business and the growth of the total company between now and 2025. Chris, do you have anything to add on China?",2.1488407,0.936

BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,101,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"When we look at the orva-cel evolution of the data and we put it in terms of the landscape and the evolution of data from outside as well, we believe that ide-cel fits perfectly in terms of further development. And orva-cel's platform becomes very important for the next generation of CAR cell development rather than the medicine -- that particular medicine itself. So therefore, we have not taken orva-cel forward as in the current form and would use the platform for evolution of the evolution of the cell therapies.",0.802543,0.735

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"David, with respect to Reblozyl in terms of the opportunity, the way I think about it is our initial indication in MDS, remember that a relatively smaller percentage of the overall MDS incidents. So in the U.S., for example, the incidence of MDS is roughly 21,000. The on-label population is a relatively small percentage of that, and that's because the initial indication obviously focuses on those patients who are lower risk, ESA-eligible, RF positive and in the second line.",1.2427076,0.902
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,106,Question,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And second, as we think about the kind of IL-23 TYK2 mechanism coming to IBD, I was wondering if you were able to compare the kind of the efficacy level you're able to achieve with the oral versus the antibodies. And is the gap there small enough that you can compete head-to-head with the IL-23s, assuming that mechanism becomes as dominant as it could be in those indications?",0.9449967,0.878
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,107,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. Let me start with your question on Part D redesign. So first of all, there is a real need to think about redesigning benefits in a way that is more aligned with the treatments of today and most importantly, that addresses significant affordability issues that are faced by patients because of inappropriate design of benefits and the high co-pay and the high out-of-pocket exposures that patients have.",0.1749503,0.225
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,108,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think it's premature to say exactly where potential legislation in Congress would evolve. We've been very clear that we are supportive of thinking about the evolution of the design. And I think when you look at our portfolio, there is -- we have a very diversified portfolio. So depending on how the coverage gap contribution of the industry evolves, that's currently 70%, and that may actually have an impact on Eliquis, should that be reduced. On the catastrophic side, you are right, some of the specialty oral medicines would be impacted by changes in that area. So it really depends.",0.759112,0.805
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,109,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And when you have a diversified portfolio that may be areas that are impacted negatively, there are areas potentially impacted positively in terms of patients but also in terms of the contribution we already make. So when we look at concrete proposals, we'll be able to assess the impact on our portfolio better. But I think it's important to remember that different medicines in our portfolio today are impacted differently in the various phases of coverage in Medicare. Chris?",1.4652206,0.971
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,110,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. So Ronny, we're obviously very enthusiastic about the opportunity that we have to play with potentially multiple drugs in IBD, initially with Zeposia and then pending the data with TYK, potentially an opportunity with deucravacritinib as well. The thing to keep in mind is that while IBD is a competitive space, there continues to be a need for efficacious drugs that have a manageable safety profile. Ultimately, we believe that the competitive dynamics are going to play out along a few dimensions.",1.7946896,0.835
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,111,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Obviously, efficacy, safety, route of administration is very important here. And because this is a chronic disease where patients are going to cycle through multiple products, we think having a novel mechanism of action is important. And so when you look at the 2 broad categories of treatments that are available today, notably biologics and JAK inhibitors, we think our initial foray into this space with Zeposia is favorably positioned.",2.0669409,0.978
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,112,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"For example, we think Zeposia demonstrates efficacy that is competitive with biologics in an oral formulation with an improved safety profile certainly versus the TNF inhibitors. So we think we play very well there. And similarly, with respect to the JAKs, Zeposia administrates efficacy that's generally competitive with JAKs as well and again, an improved safety profile. And across both of those categories being a novel S1P in the space, we think is going to be important.",1.657442,0.599

You gave the numbers quarter-on-quarter. Can you confirm the year-on-year impact? And then also on the TYK2, we've seen a very positive headline, press releases in psoriasis. I'm wondering when we might see the data, how soon you could file and whether you expect an FDA panel? And just a quick comment, perhaps because in the press releases, you do mentioned the secondary endpoints. Some were met, which implies, some are not met. And I just wondered how crucial they were with their competitive profile of the drug?",0.4438632,0.402
BMY-2020-Q4-2021-02-04,116,Answer,2021-02-04,4,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes.

So David, I can take the second part of the question around deucravacritinib very quickly. In terms of the presentation of the data, we anticipate presenting the first of the two studies at [indiscernible] later this -- I think it's in the second quarter. It's -- I think, in April.

As we've said, we've met the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints. We are very comfortable with the data that we've seen, showing the superiority not only against placebo, but also against OTEZLA.

I don't think you should disregard atrial fibrillation from any trial further. Those are the discussions that we still need to have.

We are seeing pressure on U.S. sales due to the adoption of Opdivo in the adjuvant melanoma setting. Going forward, we expect these trends to stabilize and our outlook remains positive with the potential launches in the first line renal cell and first line lung. From the franchise perspective, we expect the growth of Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma were more than offset the erosion of Yervoy. Our strong commercial execution across the portfolio also resulted in substantial growth for -- in the quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis extended its leadership position with almost 50% TRx share of the NOAC market.

If we didn't have 227 reports, I don't think I get through it. So, let me just address a couple of your points here that I think are well crafted and are important. The first thing I'll say is that I feel very confident that this is both a TMB story and an Opdivo-Yervoy story. And I think both are important. Because first, understanding the biology, selecting the patients are going to benefit most. TMB looks like a very powerful biomarker.

Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","The second point comes down to the contribution of components and how important Yervoy is? And for me, I have felt for some time that Yervoy is performing extremely well in a number of different settings. Remember, benefit in melanoma, benefit in renal cell cancer and now benefit in this case, in non-small cell lung cancer it can be high. And what I can tell you is that our analysis of the data thus far makes us very confident that Yervoy is a big part of what we're seeing today. And it's not just Opdivo, but the Yervoy is part of this as well. And I want to mention as you said, its low dose Yervoy that's given every 6 weeks and has that advantage in terms of being well tolerated by patients as we move forward. So, I think that it's not just TMB or the combo it really is a story about both and I'll turn it over to Giovanni for his thoughts.",0.4460111,0.827

So first of all, I want to strength again, reinforce what Tom was saying about the importance of the combination about Opdivo and Yervoy.

BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,71,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second thing that I want to say is that I'm quite proud actually of the work that we've done in optimizing the regimen and I think that's really important, the dose and schedule of the Yervoy as part of the combination are really important. Based on the totality of the data that we have seen so far you know our confidence and our broadline cancer program has only increased. And I think that's important because in parallel it also strengthens overall the growth outlook for the company.

BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,78,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I think you alluded to the ascertainment rate while it was 60% in the trial, we have a lot of confidence that that will rise with improvements to methodologies, pathology techniques as well as surgical techniques. So, we're hopeful that, that will improve overtime and I would say that we're very ready for this, the team at Bristol-Myers Squibb has been focused on the translational side but also on helping educate physicians. I would say in the academic centers, there is a high degree of awareness of TMB and there is already quite substantial testing today. I would say it gets much lower than that when you go out into community oncology and that's where we're focusing a lot of our educational and continuing research efforts. We have an ongoing safety clinical trial in first line lung cancer looking at patients with Opdivo and low dose Yervoy being treated after having their TMB accessed. And that's being conducted through our I-O icon network, we have a great partnership with a large network in community oncology, so it will help to be able to generate data and describe the safety profile of the drug, on a must larger community base population.

I think both clinicians and payers have been looking for a better way, to segment the first-line lung cancer market and I think with the advent and exciting information that we have, that we hope will be presented as Tom said, at an upcoming Scientific Congress and publish thereafter. We hope that we will be able to go to payers in the U.S and around the world and say, this is a patient population that discretely benefits from Yervoy, low dose Yervoy plus Opdivo.

I think the way I would approach my view of the first line lung cancer market is, we've known for a while that PD-L1 expression has been a perfect biomarker in being able to stratify and select patients. Now with this very large dataset, we've been able to establish the value of a high predictive biomarker in TMB. And we have a compelling profile of Opdivo plus low dose Yervoy as a result. And I think that that really is an opportunity for us to redefine the way in which clinicians, payers and patients think about first line lung cancer. So, we're excited about that.",1.4682746,0.713
BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,91,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations",I think there will still be a role for PD-L1 expression to play to understand where other options and other treatment modalities should be used. But I think the compelling nature of these data and the predictive nature of TMB will allow us to establish a very good presence in the market. I would also say that the partnership with Foundation Medicine has been a good one for us. We're working very closely with them to understand the logistics of how TMB testing and patterns of testing are currently occurring. I would say that academic centers are doing very well in turnaround time and tissue ascertainment.,0.0278293,0.918
BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,92,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Charles A. Bancroft,"CFO, EVP & Head-Global Business Operations","And I think that that will propagate into the community. It will take some time and obviously when physicians see a very compelling clinical profile, I think that that is likely to lead to an acceleration and testing and an improvement in turnaround times. Although, our hope is that we would establish testing for TMB as a panel type of test as a test that occurs early in the diagnosis of a patient so that it is available to the primary treating physician early in that treatment decision making process. And that's our goal really going forward. So, the turnaround time today will hopefully not be an impediment as we go forward.

Just the question on this TMB data set and the competitive landscape in front line. When you consider the other data sets from these all all-comer chemo combos data sets out there, what sort of hurdle that you consider as you think about the commercial kind of opportunity here. Basically, do we need to see improved hazard ratios in this TMB population relative to some of those overall competitor data sets for chemo combo data sets that you talked about here to see physicians adopt or do you think it's really a debate here of some physicians preferring, kind of IO-IO versus IO-chemo. So just trying to get a little bit of sense, how you're thinking about that. My second quarter we're just clarifying earlier comments on filing. I guess do you think there is a potential pathway to file this data earlier than lead 2018 2019 read-out from the OS arm of the 18 study.

So first of all, the progression free survival was the core primary end point of this study and so given the strength of the data as Tom mentioned we will discuss that with regulatory authorities but that was the core primary endpoint of the trial and in the TMB part of the study is the data is, that data is mature and ready.",2.6043738,0.884

In fact, you know 30% of it is treated by physicians in the academic and hospital setting, up to 70% is there in the community.",0.1023857,-0.128
BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,102,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, it's obvious that depending on competitive data set and our data that we'll always be physician preferences in patient profiles that are more indicate different treatment options. But I think what's important here, is the ability to identify a patient population that is, that has potential to respond to treatment strategy with the regiment of Opdivo plus Yervoy, what's also important here, is the ability to identify patients that are not likely respond and both are really critical, so I think the biomarker here is very important, it identifies the population of patients that should be treated in our mind, based on the data, with Opdivo plus Yervoy, and it also helps to define which patient actually made that, which patients may benefit from a different treatment their strategy. Because it is clear that for patients with low TMB going for a combination of immuno-oncology agents may not be the right strategy.

There is lot a lot of questions on the mind of treating physicians on what to do in lower PD-L1 expressing patients, in terms of treatment options available. We know what the - 21 G-set dataset, we haven't as you mentioned seen the 189 datasets, but there is still a lot of patients in the market who have low PD-L1 expressions, who are not receiving an immunotherapy options. With the TMB in biomarker, we are able to look across all PD1 expression and in rich for a population with TMB and we have been able to in this clinical trial demonstrate a benefit in PFS with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy and I think that's a very compelling treatment option for clinicians going forward.",2.1930836,0.9

I mean granted all that is still in flux, and I know you guys are using 10 mutations per megabit. So, I guess my question is how does your data look for combo versus chemo in 10 to 19 mutations per megabit versus 20 plus mutations per megabit and I only ask because EMA has been doing some of this in prior regulatory reviews.

So, I'll start off with the first one, which is how did we change the stat plan, and why do we change the step plan. And so just to give you a sense, the data in lung cancer has been developing an emerging incredibly quickly. And this -- the way -- our understanding of the biology of lung cancer has improved. So, we look the study 26 and I don't know if you guys noticed, but 26 didn't exactly hit what we were hoping for in that setting.

So, we change the stat plan to enable us to give us, to give us the size, remember we nearly double the size of study of part 1A of the trial. That was really important to be able to do, which gives us the statistical optionality to be able to look at a marker like TMB, while still preserving the ability to look at that - to look at OS in a PL1 defined patient group.",0.3744201,-0.226

I think what I can say about CTLA 4 being validated in this setting, is from our look at the data we have seen so far, we believe that Yervoy is a very important part of this story, and we think that Yervoy is clearly critical to the benefit in this TMB high patient population as well, I say at this point.",0.5994036,0.817

And then when we prospectively analyze that in a patient sample, using our cart tissue, we were able to show this result. I can't tell you the patients who have got 25 don't do even better, they might. Where the patients who have 7 might also do well.

As Tom mentioned, we are measuring TMB in over 100 trials. You will remember that one of the first trials in which we started stratifying for TMB status was [indiscernible] that's included in the study design. We're looking at TMB across multiple types of tumors lines of therapy. And obviously as our clinical development program evolves, we will learn much more about the role of TMB in selecting patient populations outside of lung cancer.",0.496475,-0.66
BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,141,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Vamil thank you for your questions. I'd say couple of things to answer them. The first question is, Part 1B is finished because we used patients from Part 1B that were PD-L1 negative, but high TMB there in the TMB analysis. And the second thing is as we then design part 2 which is acting the Opdivo chemo question across a broad group of patients regardless of their PD-L1 status. And that's the way we design in this fiscal analysis.",0.7276342,-0.118
BMY-2017-Q4-2018-02-05,142,Answer,2018-02-05,4,2017,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think your question on, the first part of your question on overall survival for TMB versus overall survival in the PD-L1 reflected patient population. Because this study is so large, that's one of the things again one of the thing people asked earlier and how do we change it and why do we change it? We wanted to have optionality to look at a couple of the important questions and value reported PFS on this we just haven't seen the OS data for TMB and so it's entirely that we will see OS data from TMB and we look forward to seeing that data but we just have not seen that data at this point. We're waiting for that data set to mature. At the same time, we have this preserved ability to look at overall survival in a PDL-1 population. So, I think that those are really important points to get across. And part 1-B was the smallest of all the three parts of study-227 and part-2 has almost 750 patients. So, if you're wondering about the chemo question with Opdivo that will be answered in part-2 of our study.",0.0371107,0.874

As you know we had discussed that we were in conversation with the FDA to start to the next phase of development for FGS-21 one of the veins we discussed with the FDA was the fact that we had in our original set is we have not included a post treatment biopsy of different doses, so we've decided to go ahead with the study that we'll be looking at post treatment biopsies before we move into a large phase-3 study and that study is starting right now.",0.2707091,0.318

We are not going to comment more on our regulatory interactions, but I just want to stress the TMB part of the study met its primary end point and the primary end point is progression free survival in that study and we look forward to discussing that with the regulatory authorities around the world. I think that, Thomas said earlier that we have just received the topline data, there are a significant number of secondary analysis that we will be conducting and we look forward to presenting that data together with other analysis at a future meeting, obviously as we have mentioned the study looked at TMB regardless of PD-L1 expression and so it included patients across the full spectrum of PD-L1.",0.3442677,0.593

BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,42,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Great. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like the clinical trials.gov listing for your Factor XIa Phase 2 study in total knee replacement is now showing a completion data this month. So just wondering if we could actually get data from that trial here over the near term? And then looking back at enoxaparin rate of bleeding this setting, it looks to be about 4% to 5%. So just wondering what level of differentiation there you're looking for? Thank you.",0.2803181,0.66

BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,44,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Terence. Looking forward to the readout of the first trial and the total knee replacement setting, which is testing the single agent Factor XIa in the next couple of months as we look forward now and also as we've spoken before, the second trial would read out in the early part of next year as well. In totality, it will be the one determining factor to really ascertain truly the overall safety. And of course what we can gain in terms of efficacy to define the plan as we move forward. So more to come on that, I did not go into the specifics of what level of improvement we are trying to look for. Those are going to be defined with the differences that we see, but again, we've said before, if we can produce another agent for prevention of clotting and thrombosis at the level that is similar in efficacy, but better safety profile, that is what we looking for and certainly looking forward to the data in combination with anti-platelet agents as well. Thank you.",0.8767396,0.637

BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,48,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then my second question was just a little bit more color on the Opdivo adjuvant launches, as we think about kind of treatment rates and development of these markets. Just a little bit more color of how do we think about the esophageal and bladder kind of ramps as we think about kind of this year. So are these big 2021 events, or is this going to take a couple of years to really see that the opportunity for those indications? Thanks so much.",0.0129225,0.929
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,49,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Thank you, Chris. So first on LAG-3, let me share my enthusiasm for fixed dose combination, which represents it really important data to validate a third immuno-oncology agent from the company. And let me ask Chris to give you his perspective on dynamics and in melanoma and where that fixed dose combination may play and then give you insights into the uptake in adjuvant.",0.1114435,0.99
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,50,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yes. Thanks for the, thanks for the question Chris. So let me start with LAG-3. So first let me say that we are very excited and pleased with the data readout that we've seen for the third IO that we have from BMS. The results are very encouraging and I think seeing an enhanced activity on top of Opdivo in melanoma, that's a pretty high bar. And so we're excited about the opportunity to bring this to patients. In terms of where it fits, you remember the current landscape of first-line melanoma, Opdivo, Yervoy represents about 35% to 40% of first-line melanoma. Approximately 30% of this market is still single agent IO, and you've got another 30% that is non-IO. So we think there's a real clear opportunity here for us to drive the benefit of relatlimab plus Opdivo into that population. There's clearly a continued unmet need with physicians looking for additional options that have a dual IO like effect, and we're looking forward to bringing that combination to patients as we work our way through the regulatory process.",0.1454749,0.982
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,51,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In terms of the adjuvant opportunities, again, this is going to be an important opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year, and certainly as we look about ??""look for the growth opportunities beyond 2021. You noted esophageal and the upcoming opportunity with bladder, we're very excited about those. With adjuvant esophageal, this is a substantial patient population with considerable unmet need. The treatment rates here are relatively low today just given the lack of approved therapies. So we would anticipate that over time. We'll be able to drive utilization both in terms of the patients who are being treated today, which is relatively small and then improve treatment rates over time much the way we did you'll recall in adjunct melanoma. And we would expect a similar dynamic to play out as we launch in bladder cancer as well. And so very excited about those opportunities and look forward to seeing those launches play out in the coming months.",0.462558,0.637
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,55,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then separately just wanted to get a little bit of a better sense of your thoughts around the stroke, the SSPs trial with Factor XI still first half of next year. And maybe you could just remind us of the opportunity that you see there. In our view, we think that could be a $4 billion plus opportunity. That's really not reflected in expectations, but nobody knows this space better than Bristol-Myers Squibb given your experience with Plavix. Thanks.",0.5314778,0.981

So let me just say before I pass it to Samit, to answer both of your questions that, what are you look forward to presenting the LAG-3 data at ASCO. I think it's going to be a great opportunity to show the strength of the data and on Factor XIa, let me just agree with you. This is a space we know extremely well where we've demonstrated our ability to be successful with Plavix, of course, going back a few years and with Eliquis, we're seeing as we speak now with the current performance of Eliquis.

And certainly very excited to see the data coming out great for the patients, and certainly very happy with where we going in the pipeline for LAG-3 in oncology for BMS as well. Overall, the natural progression after seeing the data in the first line setting of addition of relatlimab on top of nivo would be to go into the adjuvant setting. And that's where you began - beginning to hear a lot more, that we'll be progressing into a Phase 3 program in the adjuvant setting for this core formulation that we now have as a fixed dose combination for Opdivo plus relatlimab. Certainly more to follow as we look deeper into the data for the metastatic trial to gain a more in-depth knowledge on the biomarkers, as well as the long-term follow-up that will come from the current 047 trial that will continue to evolve in terms of our knowledge.",0.5826397,0.477
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,58,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Now, the second part which you asked is about the non-small cell lung cancer opportunities, certainly excited to have started the early [indiscernible] generation trial, as well as looking at that combination of nivo plus relatlimab plus chemotherapy to see where we can take it. And that's the idea behind accelerating the enrollment in that trial. So that by the end of the year, we can initiate a Phase 3 program in that setting if we have tolerability that is demonstrated in that early trial that we're looking at.",0.1208878,0.94
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,59,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In addition to that, you continue to hear evolution of the data, potentially hepatocellular carcinoma that we're looking also to have - some look into in the Phase 2 study, and that can open up additional indications that we look forward. Beyond that in the SSP trial, yes, we are still looking forward to the readout in the early part of 2022. As I said earlier, there are two opportunities. Opportunity number one is to improve on the current anticoagulation paradigm with a single agent and then opportunity number two is to expand the use of anticoagulants to the background therapy of antiplatelet agents. And those are the two studies that together will form the basis of the clinical development plan that we are thinking through, whether it'd be the venous side or the arterial side of thrombosis.",0.8214049,0.637

We obviously think about this quite a bit, as we think about the number of new PD-1 entrance in the market, we really look at it on two dimensions. First, there's the competitive impact of having additional players on the market. Frankly, that's an area that we pay attention to, but we're a little bit less concerned about.",0.1095737,0.891

BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,67,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"The second dimension that we look at is, when you're raising, which is the risk of commoditization of a market. And the way we look at that is commoditization we think requires two things. It requires a low cost entrance, and it requires perceived interchangeability on the part of payers, providers, and patients. The risk of both of these things coming together likely varies. We believe by geography, healthcare system and may be even by therapeutic setting, but we pay a very close attention to this.",0.0755423,0.743

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"In terms of the risk, we absolutely believe it's something that we need to stay on top of, it's as you note, very dynamic. Currently the areas where we see the greatest risks don't overlap with our largest markets at least today. But we certainly have plans to address the risks as they become more tangible. The two things that I think we can continue to do that position as well against this threat are, first, continue to leverage the extremely broad data set that we have generated in I-O to ensure that treatment decisions continue to be clinically driven.",0.0295438,0.827

So let me try to hit on each of these relatively quickly. So Reblozyl, we're very pleased actually with the continued strong execution of the teams and what we're hearing on Reblozyl. And our expectations for growth this year, and certainly in the long-term remain unchanged. As for the dynamics that we saw in the quarter, sales were relatively flat, Q4 into Q1. And there were really two factors underlying this. First, as you will have heard from some of our peers, we have seen new patient volumes down in hematology, generally.",0.1783844,0.34
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,77,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"They were down about 10% to 20% versus pre-COVID levels in the MDS population. And so that was one of the factors that play, at least for the quarter. And we have seen specific to Reblozyl, a bit of a prolonged bolus wash-out period. And to give you some context around that in Q4, we estimate that bolus patients for Reblozyl were roughly around 40% of the overall business. In Q1 that has come down to about 20% to 25%. And we would expect those patients to continue to come off therapy over the coming months.",0.4483919,0.906

Onureg and Zeposia, in terms of pivot points, I would say, as we have discussed in MS, and as you've seen with some of our peers, it does take time to transition patients from written scripts to commercial dispensation in MS.",0.0680628,0.859

And that launch is going very well. In fact, we saw patient demand volume increased about 50% from Q4 coming into Q1. And I would say in that space, we're very excited with what we're seeing. Now, again it's a market where we're creating a new treatment paradigm and that's going to take some time.

Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And then pivoting to your question on cell therapy, we're very excited about the two cell therapy launches both products have been very well received. Given Breyanzi has got a little bit more data in terms of the launch timing. Let me start there. The launch there is going very well. We've had over 50 accounts that have been activated already. Our highest priority accounts in fact were activated within eight weeks of approval. The messaging around the best-in-class profile for Breyanzi is landing well.

So I would say, the execution there has been exceptionally well. And just quickly on Abecma, obviously a bit earlier in the process for Abecma.

So it's really difficult to speculate at this point in early days, what the evolving position of the FTC will be.

And certainly, yes, we've heard the speculation around AdCom for potentially looking at it from a safety perspective for TYK2 inhibitors, and whether they belong in the JAK or not. The way we think about it is as we were presented, if you look at the data, we do believe it is very differentiated and there are absolutely good measures in terms of thinking around preclinical data, the clinical data, the mechanism of action and the way the data has evolved also on the efficacy side.",0.7146254,0.797

And we'll continue to evolve, in terms of the long-term follow-up as well. We do believe this has new breakthrough in science.

So, first of all, as you know, we have a very diversified portfolio across multiple payer segments and multiple therapeutic areas.

What I think it's more important is the fact that from our perspective, it is critical that we look at reforms that have one objective in mind, which is to improve for the ability for patients in Medicare Part D. That's sort of the core of the priority that the industry has. And the proposals that we'll continue to make as we interact with the administration will be focused on elements of Part D redesign that include establishing out of pocket caps, reducing the overall impact to patients in the catastrophic phase, smoothing expenses throughout the year.

Thanks for the question, obviously we are keenly aware of the differential in prices between the MS market and UC, as you know, we priced Zeposia in line with the value it provides and ensuring the broadest patient access in the MS market. And as we think about UC, it's certainly too early at this point to discuss how we're thinking about pricing in UC. What I would say is that we're going to factor price considerations. Now we think about the broader access and the importance of access in IBD generally.

The way to look at it though, is as Chris mentioned earlier, there's still a large number of patients who are treated with either single agent IO or through non-high regimen. So yes, O plus Y is a very important regimen, has shown very important efficacy, and long-term effect and maintenance of that effect. And so therefore it becomes important.",0.494165,0.863
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,110,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"What we are now bringing is an additional treatment potential for patients who can be treated, who have melanoma in the first-line setting with relatlimab on top of nivolumab as a single agent. And that's the reason why we are excited about this to be able to add to the treatment paradigm for prescribers and for patients to potentially use in the future once approved in this particular setting. One has to remember that we're also talking about the safety profile and its differentiation over here. So, relatlimab plus nivolumab therefore becomes an important aspect of the treatment paradigm looking at the future.",0.7827983,0.958
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,111,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Yes. And then let me take the question on Zeposia David. So, the way we think about Zeposia is first of all, we're very excited about the opportunity initially that we have both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. in MS. We think that Zeposia brings a very differentiated profile into this market. It's now in the U.S. the number one SP in terms of written prescriptions, we're gaining on oral agents. And as I mentioned earlier, we are making progress in terms of optimizing the patient pull through in terms of commercial dispense. So we think we've got considerable opportunity to continue to grow in the short term in MS in the U.S.",1.7122473,0.887
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,112,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Ex-U.S. it's still very early days for the launches of Zeposia. But I would say that in the early launch markets in Europe, Zeposia's uptake appears to be very good, particularly in markets like Germany. So, I think in the near term, there's going to be clearly a focus on maximizing the opportunity that we have with Zeposia in that market globally.",1.2136346,0.938
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,113,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And then of course, with the upcoming launch in UC, that becomes a much more important opportunity for us as we get into 2022 and beyond. Zeposia's profile looks very good. The feedback we've gotten from treaters in the IBD space is very positive. Obviously, the rate limiter in terms of the U.S. uptake is going to be accessed. We know that's a very important component, and we're going to approach that in a very step-wise fashion. It's going to be important that we drive volume initially with those patients who have insurance that is open or relatively unrestricted.",1.2647642,0.925
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,114,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"And then we'll leverage Zeposia profile to drive additional utilization. And then of course, work with payors to ensure that we continue to increase the access that patients have in that space. That will clearly take some time. But we think the opportunity in IBD for Zeposia is substantial. And that will be important both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. as we get into that launch in later in 2021, and then certainly 2022 and beyond.",1.0384463,0.44
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,117,Question,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. On LAG-3, how are you thinking about the importance of biomarkers here? And what level of granularity should we expect around the data set of ASCO as it relates to LAG-3 positivity, et cetera? And then Giovanni as different twist perhaps on the biz dev question. When you took over as CEO, I imagine there was quite a sense of urgency to diversify the company, but with the steps you've already taken to do so, would it be fair to characterize your M&A strategy from here as more about enhancing existing franchises and less about diversification as a concept? Thanks.",0.1557323,0.955
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,118,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Greg. Let me start there, and then I'll ask Samit to give you an answer on the biomarker strategy for LAG-3. I think you are absolutely right. I believe that one of the things that is a clear strength for the company today is the diversification of our business. When you look at our oncology business, solid tumors and hematology, what's happening in immunology, which is clearly the fastest growing segment of our business right now and the long-term sustainable leadership position that we have in cardiovascular medicine, I think that we have an incredibly well-diversified set of businesses with strong dynamics for all four of them. So I think that's an important foundation that we've built for the company.",0.462558,0.941
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,119,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And at this point, I see that as an opportunity because we have capabilities that we can leverage, we clearly have deep expertise, whether that's from a scientific and development perspective or from a commercial perspective growing in all of those areas. And it gives us an opportunity to look at assets where we can apply a really promising technology, apply our expertise and maximize the value of those assets.",0.2614314,0.718
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,120,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So, the priority for us now in business development is across all of those areas to continue to strengthen our portfolio.

The first one, I will say that for EFS for CheckMate-816, you've seen the data already for the pathologic complete response. Certainly very, very encouraging. Looking forward to the EFS readout toward the end of 2022 early 2023 timeframe, so it still remains from that perspective on track.

On Andrew's question around the speculation around the adcom, the speculation that we hear is around the JAK inhibitors. And we have no knowledge around including TYK2 as being included in there. And that's what I just want to clarify one more time.",0.1810022,0.917
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,130,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And let me just very quickly hit on the commercial opportunity for CheckMate-816 and then turn it back to Samit on TYK. We're happy with the results, obviously that we've seen so far with CheckMate-816. As Samit just mentioned the data continued to emerge in this space. What I would say is that this is a fairly sizable opportunity, there are about just shy of 30,000 treatable patients here. The treatment rates are in the order of 60% to 65%. So, we think there's an opportunity to do two things, one, obviously provide an opportunity in the neoadjuvant space for those patients who are being treated today and potentially continue to push the treatment rate.",0.1417352,0.7
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,131,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,And remember many patients will be identified once you have more active treatments that are available in the space.

BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,132,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Great, thank you. And in terms of the TYK2 versus a Otezla product, I think, first of all, we are excited about the data that we have. We have obviously the mechanism of action that is quite unique over here. We've seen the data in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We have additional studies that are ongoing in the IBD space, in the lupus space. The discussion around - mild-to-moderate psoriasis continues and we'll certainly share with you ultimately what the plans would be. But truly excited today where we are. And certainly, the evolution of the data at the end of the year in additional indications, we are not ready to share yet our plans for mild-to-moderate psoriasis.",1.1375347,0.637

So to answer your second question, as we've said, 90% of the business by 2025 being continuing business that excludes Revlimid and Pomalyst in that 90%, we've said about a third are the launch brands, the rest is the current online portfolio. We're now breaking that 70% down further into individual products. But I think what's important there is actually the strength of the emerging business for the remainder of the decade. And obviously the launch brands become particularly important given that we're discussing 2025.",0.355647,0.883

It is clear that we have a very well-established standard-of-care with O plus Y. And long durability of response demonstrated over a long period of time. But I just want to, again, reiterate from an efficacy perspective, from a safety perspective, we're really excited to be able to show the data at ASCO Summit.",0.3638526,0.727

So, it would be unfair to start comparing the data for the two trials. Secondly, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as Chris had said earlier, as Giovanni just said, has been established for a long time so we have long-term data, overall survival data and response rate data. For relatlimab we do not have the overall survival data, as well as the response rate data, but we are excited to see where we stand with our overall progression-free survival data as compared to single agent nivolumab.

And then I can maybe turn it over to Samit for the adcom question. So very happy with the performance of Zeposia in MS, particularly as you point out in-light of the COVID environment. This was, as we had talked about last year, a market that was hit by COVID in terms of new patient volume being down. And obviously this is a market that we are entering into relatively new for BMS.",0.3780853,0.97
BMY-2021-Q1-2021-04-29,147,Answer,2021-04-29,1,2021,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And so at the end of last year, we spent a considerable amount of time making sure we were engaging with customers in many cases for the first time. And so our focus was continuing to do a few things. First, it was making sure that we were selling the profile for this, what we believe and clearly is being demonstrated in the data. Number one SP in this market, we've seen very good uptake in terms of written prescriptions here. Obviously, the dynamic pool of MS is relatively small and we've seen most of the business at this point coming from switch patients. And we're continuing to get an increase in new patients who were coming on board as well. So we're very happy with that. And we would expect that to continue to evolve over time.",0.1503366,0.924

We are leaders in multiple myeloma, of course, continuing to build on the heritage of the image where we pioneered in that space. We do have the broadest portfolio, and now we are beginning to see the results of that with the approval of Abecma. But the way we look at it as a three-pronged approach. On one side, we have the cell mods, which have the potential to allow for us to replace the image over time with a near-term opportunity for hydrobromide reading out this year in the fourth-line plus setting.

Just I want to confirm that the on Eliquis the $160 million true-up was actually - was indeed a tailwind and not a headwind. And then finally just on BD, the question for Giovanni, if I can, I noticed you have a somewhat new vertical for BMS so far as having neuroscience.

It is a tailwind the $160 million. With respect to business, actually, what we are doing, what our teams are doing in neuroscience is really interesting. We've obviously, over the last few years, built a very innovative model where through a network of partnerships, primarily a small team at BMS has been very successful in advancing an early portfolio that looks quite compelling at this point.

We haven't really given a target in terms of spend per year, but we've made it very clear this is the number one priority in terms of capital allocation strategy.

On Opdivo based on demand trends you've seen so far in lung. Does that change your view of growth looking to 2021. Maybe just be helpful to get a little bit more detail of a commercial view looking to what happened in 2Q from lung? And then just with respect to the pipeline, TYK2 will be obviously a big growth driver in a category you have some experience with?

Let me start with first-line lung, because I think that's probably on a number of folks' mind. The lung launches are going very well and in fact are tracking at or maybe even a bit ahead of our expectations. Let me highlight just a few things. From a share standpoint, it's still very early days, but share is currently in the mid-single digits and we've seen very good momentum in the uptake here.

However, in recent weeks, we've even seen an uptake in the use of dual IO with chemo. And again, this appears to be across subgroups. So, good momentum on utilization. Execution has been particularly good, especially given the dynamics of COVID. Most of the engagements remain virtual.

We've got good execution, physician reaction continues to be positive. And we're very pleased that in spite of entering first-line lung as the third company to market our shares. Now after eight weeks are putting us out on in the space. And as it relates to the growth, as Giovanni mentioned, we still see Opdivo as a growth brand going forward. The fundamentals of the business today continue to be relatively strong. We've got relatively stable base of business in the U.S. The second-line lung dynamics continue to play out as we had expected both in the U.S. and ex U.S. The early launch and lung is performing well. And we've got good fundamentals ex U.S.",0.9255797,0.992
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,80,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And then if you think about 2021, with the strong 9ER data that we talked about in the last quarter, we feel really good about the growth opportunities that we see for Opdivo starting in 2021. With respect to TYK, very excited, obviously about the data that we have already presented with Phase 2 and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Phase 2 data is we think if it plays out in the Phase 3 going to be compelling. Remember, this is a disease area that's large, over 2 million people are diagnosed in the U.S., EU5 in Japan with psoriatic arthritis. And there's still significant unmet need here. Two-thirds of the patients, for example, who are stable on DMARDs, continue to have disease activity. And there's considerable dissatisfaction with existing oral agents when you look at the totality of the profile, both efficacy and safety. So, obviously, early days, but we're excited about what we're seeing there.",0.6675393,0.933
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,82,Question,2020-08-06,2,2020,Terence Flynn,Goldman Sachs,"Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two for me as well. Just was wondering if you can give us an update on the timing of some of your Opdivo adjuvant studies, I know 816 for new adjuvant lung and 274 for bladder were potentially expected later this year. So just wondering, any update on timing and how you're thinking about those opportunities? And then the second I had is, I didn't see any mention of 2021 guidance in the release. Just wanted to confirm that there were no changes on that front? Thank you.",0.5814815,0.868
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,83,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Terence. Let me just briefly comment on guidance. And then, I'll ask Samit to give you a perspective on the adjuvant readout. So based on where we stand today, we are reaffirming the guidance for 2021. There is really nothing that has changed. The assumptions for COVIC are playing out as we thought. The business is strong. We've given you some comments on early our positive indicators. Of course, there is a number of considerations that we discussed the last quarter. They remain very valid today.",0.1156395,0.889
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,84,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We've made a number of assumptions regarding COVID, particularly at the end of the year and into next year, I think we'll have to see how those play out. And obviously, as you know, there is significant variability there. And at this point, we've not really included any impact from U.S. Healthcare Reform in our assumptions, because there again, it's early days and difficult to understand what an impact may be. So -- but when you look at our assumptions and the strength of our business, we're reaffirming the guidance for 2021 at this point. Samit?",0.519218,0.7
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,85,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Yep. Thank you, Giovanni. And thanks, Terence for the question. For Adjuvant, certainly, many opportunities in front of us beyond the -- still available opportunities in metastatic setting. We're looking forward to a few readouts within the overall holistic program that we have across several tumor types. The ones that we're looking forward to in 2020 would be melanoma, Checkmate 915 potentially reading out towards the end of this year. And then of course, muscle invasive bladder cancer, Checkmate 274 is the other one. And then you already mentioned a potential PCR endpoint readout for non-small cell lung cancer at the end of this year. And then in 2021, we're looking forward to the readout for esophageal cancer as well, and then others come in 2022 and beyond.",1.378914,-0.361

Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the safety profile of the product that you saw in the psoriatic arthritis study. Is anything new to report relative to what you saw with psoriasis? Or is it a similar kind of profile that you saw there? And then my second question was coming back to Opdivo in first-line lung. Just any comments of where you think you can get to from a share perspective given this strong initial launch? And when we think about the ex-U.S. opportunity here, can you just compare and contrast how you're thinking about that versus the U.S. given the lack of a 227 label Ex U.S.? Thanks so much.",0.337265,0.966

BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,90,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thanks, Chris, thank you for the question for TKY2, as already alluded to a little bit by Giovanni and then Chris, earlier, really excited for TKY2 overall. And we've seen the profile as you saw in psoriasis in the Phase 2 study. And we see similar results in terms of trending, in terms of safety and really looking forward to presenting this data in the next medical conferences. Overall, as we've said, we are excited about the data to be able to now plan the Phase 3 program in psoriatic arthritis, and looking forward to the readout towards the end of the year for the psoriasis program for the first study, and then the second study in the first quarter of next year. So nothing to report as differentiation at this time from what we've already known from a safety perspective. So Chris, do you want to take over the Opdivo question?",2.2092747,0.94
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,91,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. So one of the things that we're most pleased about with respect to what we're seeing in the early dynamics in the U.S. is that, as we had suspected, physicians are not pigeonholing the dual IO regimen to a specific patient type. In fact, as I mentioned before, we're actually seeing good uptake of the 227 regimen and really across segments across PD-L1 expression levels as well as across histologies. What I would say with respect to the patients that have gone on therapy thus far, within the one to 49 segments, the patients are generally those who are requesting non-chemo options or they may be frail patients who can't tolerate chemotherapy.",0.4267016,0.957
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,92,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"We are seeing some utilization in the greater than 50% population for patients who want or maybe need a more aggressive option than single agent PD-1. And then with a 9LA regimen, we're seeing patients who are young, maybe they're fit patients with severe disease, but they're motivated to have a more aggressive option. So those are the types of patients that we're seeing right now. Importantly, as I think about the opportunity to continue to grow here, again, I think we're going to continue to emphasize the opportunity for dual IO patient -- dual IO therapy across all patient subtypes. We have not seen as much utilization yet in the PD-L1 negative, unknown or untested segment, that's an area where IO is generally underpenetrated. So that's obviously an opportunity with a 9LA regimen. So we think we have a number of opportunities where we can continue to drive utilization across patient segment types in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., obviously, we won't have 227 on label. However, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, that data will be publicly available and obviously as appropriate, our medical teams will be engaging on that. But 9LA data by the time we launch will obviously continue to mature. That data does provide us an entree into the PD-L1 negative. So those are some of the dynamics that I think will be at play as we get into the ex U.S. market. But, again, I think we'll continue to update you as we get closer to the timing of that approval.",0.1858639,0.979
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,96,Question,2020-08-06,2,2020,Tim Anderson,Prudential,"Thank you. I have a question on the Eliquis patent ruling. Your press release last night, you said, you expect generics sometime after 2026, but before 2031? I think everyone on the analyst side expects generics around mid 2027, I mean, you get pediatric exclusivity. But I'm wondering that exclusivity could actually extend beyond that based on that press release language. You've done settlements with lots of generic challengers. You've never made any of those terms of public. So is there a reasonable possibility that generics don't arrive until something like 2028? Or maybe even later? And then on ozanimod and ulcerative colitis from the True North trial, will there be something differentiating in the data relative to the current in market competitors, beside this just being a different mechanism?",1.9220497,0.906
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,97,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tim. Let me let me start on Eliquis, and then Samit will provide some comments and True North. So first of all, let me say, we've always been confident in the strength of the IP for Eliquis. And as you alluded to, and just as a background, the IP covering Eliquis is a composition of matter patent, which expires in November of 2016, with a potential pediatric extension to May 27, and a formulation patent, which expires in 2031. And we're very pleased with the outcome when the strength of both patterns has been confirmed yesterday.",0.6935056,0.953
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,98,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So this does mean that there is potentially some extension beyond the 2026 composition of matter patent. Obviously, if we are successful at maintaining the formulation patent upon appeal . And you are right that we've settled with a number of companies and the terms of those settlements are confidential.",0.14778,0.637
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,99,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Giovanni, t hank you, I'll take on ozanimod question. Thanks for the question, Tim. I think a couple of things to note. Number one, the current treatment pattern for patients with ulcerative colitis, primarily this is dependent on biologics. And I think there is still an underserved patient population because of the need for additional treatments. And a therapy that is safe, effective and can actually be delivered orally is going to be important. And then, if you recall the trial actually enrolled patients both who were biologic naive, as well as biologic pretreated. So there is an opportunity over here for patients to be treated in the pre biologic setting as well.",2.2770511,0.931
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,100,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Zeposia, as you've seen from the MS label is a best-in-class safety profile with the absence of the first dose monitoring both for the cardiovascular aspect of it and then lack of required broad based ocular testing in this drug. Now from the Phase 3 UC trial perspective, as we look at Zeposia and obviously, the data will be presented in the future medical meeting, but it is not only met the primary endpoint, but we see very important, very significant results in the secondary endpoints as well, including the improvements in the endoscopic findings, which is very uncommon for many of the drugs out there. And these are very stringent definitions that have been used in the trial.",0.443916,0.889
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,101,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"So overall, what I would say is from a safety perspective, as well as from the efficacy perspective, you will see that this drug, which can be given orally is differentiated. And we are looking forward to the dialogue with the health authorities and agencies for submission. Chris, I wonder if you would like to comment as well?",0.0166468,0.751
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,102,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Sure. The only thing I would add to what you said, Samit, is that remembering UC, the unmet need here is really for oral options with efficacy that's comparable to biologics, but with a better safety profile than you see with existing biologic agents in JAK inhibitors. There's obviously in this space, a lot of competitive noise and the data are going to evolved and clearly we need to wait for the full True North data set to be presented. But based on what we know today, and the data that we've seen, we feel very good about the Zeposia profile. And you see the efficacy appears to be in line with biologics, but with better safety and specifically, we're not seeing either here or in the MS profile, the rates of serious infections or thrombosis or malignancies that have led to black box warnings for a number of the TNF inhibitors and JAK.",0.5979806,0.974
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,103,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So, given the chronic nature of this disease, we think Zeposia is going to have a role to play. It's an oral agent. As you noted, Tim, in your question, it has a unique mechanism of action, which actually is important given the chronic nature of this disease, and it offers a better benefit risk profile potentially than existing agents.",0.8006731,0.791

Are the settlement dates fixed now although undisclosed, or in some way are they dependent on the 2031 patent? Secondly, you've said many times that Opdivo is likely to return to growth in 2021. Can you clarify. Is that for the full year? The second half of 2021? The fourth quarter 2021? And is it dependent on Adjuvant lung approval? And then lastly on ide-cel. Has the FDA indicated that they still plan to review ide-cel in an eight months review cycle or have they not said that one way or the other? Thank you.",1.7772894,0.821
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,107,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Steve. Let me maybe take the three very quickly. So as I mentioned, the details of those settlements which are complete are confidential. And again, as I said, there is clearly potential for some extension beyond 2026. I would say in between 2026 and 2031, depending on the outcome of the appeal. And I don't think there's anything more than we can say about that. With respect to Opdivo, what we've commented on, is that the brand has an opportunity to grow in 2021. We're not really providing quarterly breakdowns of that -- of the growth. But we feel really good about where we are based on the strength of the current business and what Chris, as mentioned earlier, about first-line lung and the approval potential in first-line renal based on 9ER. And this would be the main driver. I think the only thing we can say for ide-cel is what we've already communicated. We have requested a priority review. But it's obviously the agency's decision to make that comment. Samit anything.",0.6848907,0.969

BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,110,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,No. I think you've covered Opdivo well. What we've said is that the trajectory of the growth will be determined by the Adjuvant indications that we feel very good about the growth opportunities starting in 2021 based on the dynamics I've mentioned.,0.7774869,0.925
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,115,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,David V. Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes. So thank you for the question on the integration and synergies. Look, as Giovanni and I both said on the integration side of things, we're really pleased with how quickly everything has gone. And we're very fortunate to get the vast majority of people in the roles over 90%, prior to COVID situation hitting us, which was very fortunate, because everybody knew the roles and the reporting relationships. And that really enabled everyone to come together. I think also just having a crisis like this, everyone's working remotely and getting through it and the way everyone's reacted to focus on meeting patient needs and making sure we're getting product at the door has really -- I think the cultural integration has sped up. And we've seen that through the surveys. We've done from an employee engagement perspective.",0.1267606,0.95

Elkins,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"You also know, on the integration side of things we mentioned before that we announced all the major sites around the world and there was a high overlap there. So people know where they're going to be working. So again, that helps from a cultural aspect. On the synergy side, as I said in my call, things are going very well. We're going to achieve one-third of those next year. I think the team is doing an amazing job. Within a couple weeks after us closing the deal, we got all of our major suppliers together, and we saw about a billion dollars of the $2.5 billion coming from third-party -- from third parties.

Nothing really has changed with respect to capital allocation. And what I would say is that as we've said in the past, our priority for capital allocation, the central pillar of that has always been to continue to source externally innovation through business development. So that's very much a priority for us. And as you know, we look at business development from the perspective of deals that are sort of aligned strategically with therapeutic areas.

Firstly, to Giovanni, could you give us the true level of concern in the industry. But also in Bristol regarding the President's executive order on most favored nation's IPI that you referred to in your opening comments. Extensively, it would seem that the requirements for having favorable CBO score and the HHS being able to validate that is a requirement, which doesn't seem likely given what happened last time.",1.0166764,0.936
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,122,Question,2020-08-06,2,2020,Andrew Baum,Morgan Stanley,"So what is the real risk that that changes, and therefore, this proposal has lags? I'm just trying to understand how real the threat is. And whether something has changed and we shouldn't be quite as relaxed as we are given the last time round. Second, perhaps Samit could talk to some of the forthcoming data at ESMO. You have a deep tranche of immuno-oncology agents, CCR-25, IL8 among others, what data will we see at ESMO?. And then finally, just on the COVID impact For Eliquis ex U.S., particularly in Europe, where obviously there's a delay in reimbursement. How much scope do you see for NOAC market share increases as a function of COVID? And trying to keep patients out of medical centers from getting their INR measures? Thank you.",1.138385,0.327
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,123,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So let me let me start on government related issues. Samit will cover ESMO, and Chris maybe can give you some insights into your question on demand. So first of all, let me say, Andrew, I think it's really early to provide any more granular assessment. As you know, we have not seen the IPI executive order yet. And so with respect to that, there is there is some level of uncertainty with respect to really what is in the order and what a path to implementation may be. I want to say, again, what I said in my opening remarks, we feel very strongly that it is not the right direction for the U.S. to go. I think our view is shared not just across the industry, but providers and patients associations and other policy stakeholders are aligned with our view. I think the solution to patient affordability issues in the U.S. is to work on patient affordability issues. It is really not to import models and pricing levels that are not working internationally into the U.S.",0.1931743,0.821
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,124,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And quite frankly, the IPI doesn't do as much for patients as we should be doing for patients. So our industry continues to be really open to discussing different types of solutions with the administration that would help patients more, but also would enable us to continue to invest in innovation. I think it's really important at a time in which everybody understands the importance of our industry, which quite frankly, is primarily a U.S. industry in fighting disease. The impact of IPI in the version, at least we knew would be extremely significant on our industry and the ability to continue to invest in innovation.",0.7150431,0.945
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,125,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And we hope that and we hope that we are able to move into directions that are better for patients in the U.S. From our perspective, when you think about our portfolio, it's clearly much more differentiated today than it was in the past across multiple segments. And when you look at our sales, it's about 40%. internationally and 60% in the U.S. Part B just as a reference point, it's about 15% of our business. With respect your question about the rebate rule, I think we would have to see how HHS goes about really thinking about the various sort of implications of a rebate rule and assess what the cost of that would be versus the benefits. So I'm not sure, I can really speculate on how that would be certified and whether the issues that were raised in the previous version would even be an issue at all at this point. I think that's just much as I know at this point. Samit?",0.7067594,0.931
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,126,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Samit Hirawat,Chief Medical Officer-Global Drug Development,"Thank you. Thanks, Andrew for the question on the ESMO. I think the way to look at it is there are several presentations or data that are being presented at ESMO primarily from the Phase 1 studies and some updates. But the most important one to focus on would be Checkmate 9ER for renal cell cancer, because that certainly is a differentiating therapy. And as Chris mentioned earlier, as well as you heard in the other comments in earlier presentations inclusive of all subtypes are both in and inclusive the favorable risk population, which is currently not covered to our data in the dual IO setting. There will also that update on the dual IO with a four-year follow up for that study. So those two are going to be key as they provide a better way to look at treatment for patients with renal cell cancer with a dual IO, and then of course, we're looking at potentially getting the 9ER approval later. And so that will certainly provide an additional way to treat these patients for a safe and effective medicine perspective. There was a third question on…",1.2382085,0.954
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,127,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Yes. Thanks Andrew for the question on Eliquis. So let me just say at the outset that fundamentals for Eliquis remains very strong both in the U.S. and ex U.S. With the number one OAC in 12 markets now globally. We're the number two in five additional markets. And the fundamentals, again are very strong. With respect to COVID impact, there are really two things that are at play. As David mentioned, there's an inventory work down of the inventory build that we saw in Q1. That's the largest COVID impact that we've seen for the quarter. That's mainly been in the U.S., though not exclusively, but the main impact was in the U.S. And then there's been a smaller impact on demand and that's reflective of the fact that the OAC market has been impacted by new patient volume that has come down. The negative impact was most significant in April. It's begun to recover. We've really not seen an impact on total patient volumes.",0.6342558,0.661
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,128,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"As you note, one of the potential upsides for Eliquis has been -- first of all, that Eliquis has been disproportionately unaffected by COVID relative to other players. And then secondarily, we have seen as you alluded to in a number of markets, the desire to try to keep patients out of hospitals and institution. And that's impacted warfarin share. So we've seen a decrease in warfarin share from about 16% at the end of the first quarter to about 14% in June. And that's reflective of -- we think new patients initiating on DOACs as opposed to warfarin. As you alluded to unlike warfarin, DOACs don't require extensive monitoring or dose adjustments. And so as a result, we've seen some IDNs and a number of governments seek to reduce exposure of those patients and Eliquis has disproportionately picked up that share loss.

So we are now investigating the -- in the Phase 2 study looking at seeing what we can do in terms of management of the side effect and the molecule is going to be investigated there, which will then decide how we proceed further with that molecule into a later stage trials.

So, just the baseline of where the business is today, Matt, is that market share is roughly unchanged from the last quarter. Our overall share of people you're avoiding first time renal is between 30 and 35% on the upper end of that for Opdivo and Yervoy in first line renal is between 30% and 35%. On the upper end of that for labeled indication. And then importantly, we are under penetrated as you would expect in the favorable patient population, which is currently off label.

And so as we think about positioning this agent, while it's still early days and we need to see the full data set being presented. We think these provide -- these data provide a very compelling opportunity with respect to existing IO/TKI options. So there's a clear opportunity we think to drive share from existing IO/TKI regimens in this space. Second, TKI monotherapies still a fairly sizable percentage first-line use. It's about 30% in first-line today, mostly in the favorable population. We think that's an opportunity for us as well, because remember, 9ER was conducted across risk status as well as included -- it included the favorable patient population.",0.3578908,0.984
BMY-2020-Q2-2020-08-06,146,Answer,2020-08-06,2,2020,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"So we think there's a real opportunity for us to continue to drive share in that population as well. And so, I think that -- the last thing I would say about the opportunity we have here is to remember our position in renal cell we have both mono therapy in the second-line setting we have Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line. And this gives us a options with IO plus TKI in fact will be the only company with that many different modalities at play.

As we look into the future, we recognize we are working in a very competitive space. However, we continue to see Opdivo as a growth franchise given the breadth and depth of our clinical program.

We are encouraged that the strength of the Eliquis profile continues to be reinforced by numerous new datasets and additional studies. For example, during the quarter the AUGUSTUS study was presented at ACC and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrating favorable safety results of Eliquis versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with both atrial fibrillation and ACS and/or PCI.

And then I wanted to also kind of dig into a little bit of the first-line lung commentary with respect to what you guys view as maybe a reimbursement maybe a shift in reimbursement or the comments I think that you guys made were that you're not seeing as much of a rollout due to first-line reimbursement access hurdles.

As I mentioned in my comments, we're very focused on making sure that we ring-fence and protect the value drivers of both companies, BMS and Celgene, and we're very focused on the upcoming potential launches of both brands.

BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,93,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,Let me just hit on the allocation of business. In the U.S. lung is about 25%; melanoma is about 30%; renal is just over 20%; and all other indications are about 20% as well.

So your stock has been in free fall for the last few weeks at least. In your opinion and based on your conversations with investors and analysts, why do you think this is happening? What are the biggest areas of concern that you hear about that you think are misplaced? That's the first question. Second question is Part 1 of -227 it actually has a monotherapy OPDIVO arm tucked within it. That tends to get overlooked. It's fairly large several hundred patients.",0.9021739,0.724
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,97,Question,2019-04-25,1,2019,Tim Anderson,Prudential,"I think it's around 400. It's not registrational, but it seems like there could still be a chance for the product to redeem itself in front-line lung as monotherapy following the spectacular failure of -026 back in August. So I'm guessing you'd say the odds are fairly high that we see good competitive results from this often-forgotten-about arm and recognizing it's not registrational. Can you comment?",0.2456522,0.735
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,98,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, Tim. Let me ask -- let me address your first question and I'll ask Tom to give you his perspective on the second one. So with respect to interaction with shareholders, obviously as you can imagine, we are continuing to interact with all of our shareholders. We are strong believers in the value of the company that we are creating and the opportunity to deliver significant value for shareholders in the long term. So our focus right now is really on making sure that the integration is successful and that we deliver the full value of the combination.

BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,102,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,The only other thing I would comment is that the use of monotherapy right now in the first-line setting tends to be dominated in the greater than 50% PD-L1 expression. That's almost entirely catered to monotherapy and the vast majority of the business outside of that setting has begun to evolve to a chemo combo.,1.9700823,0.361

BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,116,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Thanks for the question. So let me just address OPDIVO growth. First, if you just put the OPDIVO story for the quarter in context it was a very good quarter. We saw strength really across all of our tumors outside of lung cancer. In fact, we estimate that sales in all tumors outside of non-small cell lung cancer grew quarter-over-quarter and that's really a function of the base business continuing to be strong. We still have leading shares in all of our promoted tumors.",0.7341062,0.855
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,117,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"And as I mentioned, we're seeing growth as expected in first-line renal cell as well as adjuvant melanoma. So overall, you continue to see very good strength across the majority of our businesses. The headwinds that we saw in the first quarter really were very much focused on lung cancer. As expected, we continue to see pressure in the second-line setting due to the decrease in the eligible pool of patients I referenced previously. That's very much in line with the expectations, but does impact quarter-over-quarter growth.",1.2195213,0.773
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,118,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"The second thing that we saw this quarter was we saw a decrease in OPDIVO monotherapy nonpromoted sales in the first-line setting. That had been running about 4% to 5% in the latter half of 2018. We saw that come down in the first quarter to about 1% and I would expect, it's going to stay in that range for the remainder of the year. And as we flash forward to the remainder of the year, I think that first and foremost we continue to see Opdivo growing globally year-over-year, but I think the dynamics that you saw in the first quarter are likely going to continue as we move forward through the remainder of the year. Just addressing the question in renal cell the 40% share the vast majority of that is in the intermediate and poor population. That is consistent with our label. We do see about 5% share in the favorable risk population, but that's relatively small in the grand scheme of things.",0.5018699,0.874
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,122,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Vamil. This is Giovanni. Let me just start with the question about pricing. So first of all, let me say as I've said many times, I think that from my perspective we are entering a period in, which we have to expect that the discussion about pricing and reimbursement will continue. I personally feel that, it will be an evolution over time, and I do believe that the pressure to demonstrate value and the focus of payers on pricing and access will continue in the U.S. And in fact, as you may remember, I really believe that one of the important things for us to be doing is to continue to accelerate strengthening and broadening the pipeline adding more growth drivers for the company diversifying the portfolio with a larger number of assets and having a presence at the company that spans across multiple payer segments. I think these are all things that in an increasingly competitive market from a payer perspective, which is what we should be expecting, will position BMS much better as a broader innovation company after the transaction with Celgene is completed.",0.0755467,0.953
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,123,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"With - now with respect to the IPI international referencing as you know we don't think that's a really good idea and we are really not supportive of that proposal. Because I think when you look at what is happening in many of the countries where they are included in that reference basket is that patients are not having access to new therapies, when you look at the approval of Opdivo and Yervoy in metastatic melanoma that's a transformational regimen as a standard of care in the U.S. It was approved in Europe in 2016, if I remember correctly. And I think in almost half of the markets included in the basket, it's not being reimbursed yet. I think the same is true for the adjuvant melanoma indication approved last year that are many of the markets that are included in the reference basket where that's not reimbursed yet. And almost half of the oncology products approved in the last few years are not reimbursed in those markets.",0.3651425,0.967
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,124,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Giovanni Caforio,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we are proponents of policies that enable stakeholders to continue to work together to address the issues of out-of-pocket exposure for patients and affordability and access, but in a way that continues to reinforce and reward innovation. And clearly, that's not what that proposal does. It's difficult for me to handicap the probability that a radical proposal like IPI has in truly moving forward. What I can tell you is that as an industry we are in discussions with the administration and we are supportive of policies that achieve some of the goals of out-of-pocket exposures for patients, but in a way that rewards innovation.",0.2912525,0.98
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,125,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S. Boerner,Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP,"Let me just quickly comment on the first-line opportunity. Undoubtedly, the timing of Merck entering first-line vis-à-vis data readout from us is an important consideration. It does frame the competitive context into which we would be launching. What I would say though is that, front-line lung cancer is a very large opportunity. There is still room to play, as I mentioned earlier, only about just over half of different line opportunities currently being addressed through I-O therapy. I don't think we think about this in terms of needing to hit a particular hazard ratio. Physicians are still looking for multiple options to treat patients in this space. They're looking for chemo sparing options, which is obviously relevant potentially to Part 1a. And what I would say is that from a competitive standpoint we know this space well and we know how to compete and we're looking forward to seeing this data readout.",0.8859387,0.904

Previously the Opdivo plus Yervoy OS data was expected in the second quarter. And that was a push out from prior expectations, which at one point were late 2018.

Both very good questions and I think that to a certain extent the answer is going to be these dynamics are going to have to play out in the marketplace over the coming months. What I would say with respect to OPDIVO plus YERVOY continuing to be a standard of care in the front-line setting is I very much think that it will be one of multiple modalities that are an option for first-line patients. I would suspect that, the initial use of I-O plus TKI will likely be in the favorable patients, where we are not indicated. But I think you're going to likely see physicians make choices about, which option is best for their patients.",0.9293194,0.97

You're correct in pointing out that you might continue to see the increasing use of combination therapy in the second-line space. We've begun to see an uptake in the use of OPDIVO plus YERVOY, for example, in second-line renal cell. It's about 20% now in the second-line setting.",0.671653,0.273
BMY-2019-Q1-2019-04-25,137,Answer,2019-04-25,1,2019,Christopher S.
