FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,6,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx's second quarter fiscal 2017 and happy holidays to everyone. Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and I remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's outlook restructuring program cost and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later.",0.8373984,0.944
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,7,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to-date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. Our traffic mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we will see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past.",0.8651762,0.965
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,8,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"FedEx's integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18 and Express operating margins should widen in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements foreshadowing the longer term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth.",3.3140244,0.96
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,9,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now, FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I have seen since I have been in the business to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%. While we are committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way.",0.8401084,0.966
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,10,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, maybe investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future.",1.4075203,0.599

I have a couple of introductory comments and will then move to my financial review and outlook. First to Mike Glenn, Mike in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing sales and communications executive anywhere. You have been a fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship with you .",0.1858696,0.973
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,19,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Okay. The FedEx Corporation's second quarter FY '17 results, today we announced second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased through the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share based payments in the second quarter. Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share.",0.1163043,0.954
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,20,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Looking at Express, revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by international priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%.",0.5797101,0.978
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,21,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and outlook restructuring programs. We continued to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continued to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about $500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call and I am not going to say much more about that today.",0.7652174,0.844
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,22,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth helped push revenues up 9%. Operating income fell 12% and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates.",0.4742754,0.886
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,23,Remarks,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides great opportunities as well as difficult challenges, after challenges from higher than expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including four major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pickup, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume through improved revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth.",0.0532609,0.988

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Turning to our corporate outlook, based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and outlook restructuring costs and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT.

FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,31,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Henry Maier,,"This is Henry Maier. Let me just add, as Alan noted in his remarks, the integration of FedEx Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost yields a number of benefits that positively impacts Ground margins. To name a few, we get improved delivery density and revenue per stop. We get lower cost through improved pickup and delivery geographies. We get a lower cost structure due to fewer nodes on the network. We reduced our postage expense. And we moved to a single contracted service provider model. All of these things will improve our operating margins over the longer term.",1.0356875,0.869

FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,33,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Tom thanks for the question. Take it back up to the 50,000 foot level, from a financial standpoint, earnings, EPS standpoint, this year is going just as I thought it was going to go and my team thought it was going to go. We were well aware that this big increase in capacity and the hiring that we had to do in advance of the peak was going to hurt the second quarter at Ground. We also knew that Express was going to outperform expectations. And if you take a look at Ground's second quarter results starting in fiscal '13 and look through this fiscal '17, you will see how well they have delivered on that promise. So, we haven't changed the year. We still expect to hit the year and this wasn't very surprising to us at all. We knew this was coming. It's a little shocking to see a 250 basis point drop year-over-year in the margin. And as I said, it will probably be restrained a bit in the next quarter. But believe me, we have really good plans to get the returns, as Fred mentioned, on this.",0.2597826,0.812
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,36,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Henry Maier,,"Brandon, it was 185 real estate projects. In the history of the company, we have never opened up four hubs in a year, so it is a big deal. If you want to look at the expense line, the biggest drivers were rent, depreciation, building insurance and property tax, which were all driven by the expansion. In addition, in the second quarter, not only did we have to staff those facilities and as Fred noted, these are sizable operations. Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we are staffing up for peak. So those are the two major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There is higher postage and higher line haul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here.",0.2674681,-0.262
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,38,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business to business. And a lot of it is business to consumer, but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you would be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business to business and the business to consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we are trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business to residential business - I mean, the postal service is the biggest, at all it makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there and they are making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this. So that's a very good point that you bring up.",0.4068428,-0.317
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,39,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Mickey Foster,Vice President-Investor Relations,"Okay. Now, we are going to do two internet questions.",0.627451,0.226
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,40,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay, here are two internet questions. Well, this is from Ken Hoexter. Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? We are going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I will ask Rob Carter to comment on it.",0.254065,0.751
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,42,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So by the way, for those of you who don't know, I didn't give the paid commercial announcement. Ken is with Merrill Lynch, so I should have said that. Next question, are FedEx Ground ISPs seeing any increased competition or wage pressure in hiring delivery drivers, David Vernon, Bernstein.

FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,43,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Henry Maier,,"Hey David, this is Henry Maier. Not that we are aware of, but I would add here that we are increasingly challenged in seven to nine markets to find package handlers. Those markets tend to be markets where many of our customers are operating fulfillment centers and we tend to try to source those handler jobs from the same pool of labor. And as a result of that, we are seeing, particularly this time a year, the need to increase hourly pay rates, offer surge pay and peak bonus pay in an effort to source an adequate number of people to staff these facilities.",0.6021788,0.796
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,47,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott. Let me answer the question by telling you that first of all, we are very proud of the quarter we just finished. It's our record highest quarter we ever had. $654 million of FedEx Express segment is the highest we have ever had, the second highest operating profit margin we have ever had in the history of our company at 9.7%. Sequentially oddly enough, you asked the question. I actually knew the answer. Its 4 years in a row that we have actually had in the second quarter increasing profits and increasing margins. And actually since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we are up 140%, so how about those numbers. On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West - the East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were - would be. The overall yield increased so that our revenue for domestic packages went up 2%. And across the world, it's actually gone up 2%. So for us, we are in the sweet spot. Our costs are right where we want them to be and our profits are record high.",0.1594828,0.98
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,48,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"This is Alan, as to Q2 over Q1, nothing to worry about there. It's mostly just a bucketful, a little timing issue. So I think just keep watching how we do on the year-over-year quarters and how we finish out the year, and I think you will be fairly pleased.",0.5630435,0.649
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,49,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There was also, at the Express segment, a single customer who moved some traffic out of the quarter in the last part of the quarter that hit into peak. So absent that, it would have been an up quarter, so that's a little bit of an item that you see in those numbers.",0.1317751,0.0
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,53,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So let me mention one other thing here that seems to be not clear to a lot of people. These huge facilities that we are opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated is shockingly low. So there is huge amount of leverage into these network investments or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house, because you start talking about pickup and delivery and line-haul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There is where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic, so that you keep your line-haul and your PUD cost at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he has described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or '20? So, that's why we say with some confidence, these results will pop back up. You can't just put these facilities out and operate them at full capacity day 1. They are put out there in advance of volume that we think will be growing over many years and will be accretive to volume - accretive to profit, sorry.",0.7479675,0.832
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,54,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Mickey Foster,Vice President-Investor Relations,Okay. Let's go back to two more Internet questions.,0.7772672,0.226
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,55,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay, two more Internet questions. Could you please provide us with an update on the integration of SmartPost into Ground? Well, that's timely. Have you begun to incorporate dynamic capabilities? And if not, when do you expect this to ramp up? Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. Henry?",0.5291328,0.834
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,56,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Henry Maier,,"Yes, thanks for the question. Listen, there is three distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September 15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down line-haul costs and improved service. There are two parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond.",0.849737,0.978
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,57,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I have several questions here on the election and what we think that might mean for FedEx. In fact, there are two or three of them. I am going to hold that for - I will address it a little bit later. But let me get some more, for lack of a better word, technocratic questions out of the way here. There is one about how will we handle foreign exchange hedging following the acquisition of TNT. Will their program be carried over and implemented? And that's from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan. Alan?",1.3302846,0.173
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,58,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Thanks for the question, Brian. What we found at TNT is a excellent program, very well thought out, well controlled and well executed. We are getting our hands around what our total corporate strategy is going to be for hedging. We will be hedging. We will probably be using a lot of instruments, but we will only be hedging known exposures that we believe are real. And at the end of the day, with where the dollar has been going, you can't hedge it all away. You've got to continue to use pricing. I don't know where you think the euro is going to end up, but I know where I think it's going to end up. No amount of hedging is going to protect us from that and that profitability translation, so it's a mixture of hedging and pricing.",0.4003623,0.864
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,61,Question,2016-12-20,2,2017,Jack Atkins,Stephens,"Great. Thanks for the time. Could you comment or just expand on your comments around the Freight segment and your expectation for improved margins there in 2020 sort of what do you think is going to be driving that? And then you mentioned how you think this will impact the overall industry. I would just be curious to get your expanded comments on that. And then I guess more broadly, when we think about the three different segments, everything seems to be pointing to 2020 being a very big year in terms of all these projects coming together. Is there any sort of thought of maybe putting together some long-term guidance for the consolidated corporation given that timeframe?",1.3321234,0.933
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,63,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,I tried to give you that forecast and General Counsel came over and grabbed my tie and started pulling it.,2.7862466,0.0

There is a first quarter of international priority volume growth about 2 years and also nice international export yield, so curious just if you can elaborate a little bit on what drove it, how sustainable is it and Fred, maybe I would pull you into the political discussion, just thoughts on trade influence there? Thanks.",1.2247987,0.922
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,66,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes, you are right. We are very pleased with that on the international front and I think it's our expanded service capabilities and offerings. Quite frankly, we have a different array of offerings now. We have a deferred service offering in the marketplace and that's growing very nicely at 4%. Overall, international priority now has more space and capacity in our existing fleet and that's now growing, too. Our sales team is very comfortable selling both. So I would say across the world and especially, in Asia and the United States back to Asia, we are doing very nicely. In fact this quarter, we are doing - starting in December, as Fred mentioned in his comments and Mike Glenn, we are off to a very good start. So yes, we are pleased, we continue to see it going that way and those are some of the reasons why.",0.8635057,0.983
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,68,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, there are a couple of questions on tax and I am going to have Alan answer this. I would just say this on the political side of the house. There is a lot of confusion and concern over what has been proposed in the House bill, as most of you know particularly this border adjustment. Having said that, I do think that there will be tax reform, which will be beneficial to us and I will ask Alan to put his thoughts on that.",1.1619241,0.422
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,70,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me just add some detail on what Alan just said. Alan mentioned that we are not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we are not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act - to move to more consumer driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high employment locations and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now, if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there is a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit and that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we are on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and act in the very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax on the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid - how much in ACA taxes was it Alan, $65 million. $65 million in extra taxes that would have gone into our healthcare plan, but went into the federal treasury in the form of ACA taxes. It was so much per covered life, I think or a plan participant, I forget what. But $65 million, I mean this thing has been a major, major issue to employers who have good healthcare plans like we have had and we have tried to keep great healthcare plans within the context of the ACA. Okay. One more, so there are about three or four questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There is one from David Vernon. There is another one from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I am going to put this all together, if you don't mind. Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on the night of December at the Competitiveness Institute, which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platform. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that one in five American's jobs are related to trade and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is in our opinion, significantly dangerous and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which by the way the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there is an excellent article in Barron's by - I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound - very similar themes. And again, its fact based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not the proper solution to the problem. I think they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they are looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they have got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administrators are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we are worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter.",1.0934959,0.997

FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,74,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, whatever was there was probably related to the increase in the dollar, but Mike put more detail on it.",0.554878,0.296
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,76,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the good news is we carry things both ways. So what you pickup on the sand pile, you ought to find also on the swing or whatever that old saying is.",1.5325203,0.44
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,82,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me just add more detail on it and just what I was saying a moment ago. I mean, we have a fantastic sales force all over the world. So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people in other areas. So, it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see with some adjustment disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we have got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there is good macroeconomic policy, which quite frankly is not the case in most places around and hopefully will be the case with tax reform here, you will see economic growth. And even with exchange rates, you will see volumes growing. And of course, as always, the fact that we think and I have said before, that we have strategies that allow us to take market share, particularly in the Express segment, which we will benefit from in the next several years.",0.7093496,0.984
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,83,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So not very strategic question, but so if there is any confusion, let me straighten you out. The accounting standards update for share-based payments which was a $0.07 benefit in the quarters and the tax rate, alright? So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it's in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we would alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about, because they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So, it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08 and the range is $0.50 wide. I would point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure and I will wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That's the one that I got the least confidence about, but we will keep at it.",0.4692029,0.834
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,86,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Henry Maier,,"Great question, Brian. Just a couple of things. One is we have had non-conveyable capacity in our network going all the way back to, I think the first year we started the business. I think the change is the rapid growth rate we are seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only two of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a homerun in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we have had such terrific service performance this year. And our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we sight them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there is also some pretty promising advancements, some material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised were actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology.",0.1288505,0.986
FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,93,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"David, this is Fred. I think we need to leave it with the broader themes that we laid out there. Again, I know from you all a standpoint, if we could be more precise on a quarterly-quarterly basis, we will. We expect Ground volumes, Ground revenues and Ground margins to go up in calendar '17 and certainly in fiscal '18 based on the traffic trends that - and yield trends that we see and the leverage in the investments that we have made. So I don't think you can take one quarter and extrapolate something and - but I think I will just leave it at that to give you the best guidance I can. And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I would be happy about it to see it inside. But it's - there are just too many moving parts to do it otherwise.",0.0443767,0.952

FDX-2017-Q2-2016-12-20,95,Answer,2016-12-20,2,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I would like to express the appreciation not just to myself, which I will come back to, but the SMC, who is all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and past one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I have ever seen in the business and I have seen a lot of these, so all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. Mike and I have worked together for 25 years directly. I have told other people his office was right next door. There is nobody that has made more contributions to this company's success than you have, Mike. And that includes the speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and industry knowledge, the sales and marketing prowess, in particular, your sense of humor, wry, though, that may be on everything other than old miss football results. And I think it's the measure of the man - I have said this publicly, that I think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here and stayed in the band and had some fun over the next 2 years to 3 years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they are going to be very good years. But he and Donna have a special needs child and they are making the right priorities. And I think that says everything you need to know about Mike Glenn's character and his commitment to his family in putting priorities in the right place. So thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours - how often, a month, 30 hours a month. So we have been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant and we will be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has.

FedEx Express posted solid revenue growth and is making good progress towards improving operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. The FedEx Ground modernization and optimization are paying off with more efficient handling with increasing growth of business-to-business and e-commerce shipments.

At all my years at FedEx, I've never been so optimistic and so sure of our strategy and our ability to deliver an exciting future.

For the quarter adjusted earnings were $5.91 per share, up 41% year-over-year driven by tax benefits and improved operating results that are covered in the earnings release.

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Turning to the full year, we finished the year with an adjusted EPS of $15.31, that's up 27% year-over-year. We invested more in our people to share some of the benefits of the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act by advancing our annual pay increases for certain U.S. hourly workers to April 1, from the normal October date for 2018. Our capital expenditures were $5.7 billion or 8.7% of revenues. We repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $1 billion in FY18.

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Regarding pensions, I would like to take a few minutes to explain the effect that new pension accounting rules will have on our financial results for FY19. Going forward, only the pension service cost will be included in operating expenses. All the other elements that make up total pension expense will now be classified as other non-operating expenses, including the year-end mark-to-market adjustment. For example, in FY18 our total pension expense excluding mark-to-market and other pension adjustments was $224 million while our service cost was $812 million. So while there was no impact on net income from these new rules, they will negatively impact our operating margin by about 90 basis points. Of course, prior years will be recast to conform to these new rules, so there will be no year-over-year impact once we have an apples-to-apples comparison starting in the first quarter of FY19.",0.2539855,-0.226
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,15,Remarks,2018-06-19,4,2018,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Since our primary pension plans are fully funded under ERISA, contributions will not be required for the foreseeable future. As a result, most of the service cost expense is really a non-cash item that has a material effect when modeling our cash flows. While no cash contributions are required in our primary U.S. pension plans, we will make voluntary contributions during FY19, but they will be at a much lower level than the $2.5 billion we contributed in FY18. I would also like to comment on the pension derisking transaction that we executed in Q4 to remove approximately 20% of our pension liabilities from the balance sheet through an annuity purchase with MetLife. This $6 billion transaction was the largest single transaction in our history and it represents a win for both our shareholders and our retirees. This event follows a long line of derisking activities, including plan design changes and special lump sum settlements, all design to reduce the volatility of our pension liabilities, and further strengthen our balance sheet.",0.2833333,0.846

Additionally, we're anticipating an effective tax rate of approximately 25% prior to year end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments which is higher than our FY18 effective tax rate due to tax benefits from transactions and TCJA impacts that will not reoccur during FY19. We expect our FY19 cash tax rate to be lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to the favorable capital expensing provision created by the TCJA.",0.2108696,0.938

For FY19, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $3 billion, the FedEx will generate very strong cash flows. Capital spending is expected to decline slightly to $5.6 billion or about 8% of projected revenues. Our TNT integration expenses are projected to be $450 million, and we expect voluntary contributions to our primary pension plans in FY19 to be significantly lower than FY18. Last week we announced that we are boosting our FY19 dividend by 30% to $0.65 per share for the quarter.

It is clear our pricing strategies that allow us to grow volumes increase yields across the portfolio show continued success. For our U.S. domestic Express business, revenue and yield increased 4% and 3% respectively, excluding the impact of fuel yield per package increased 1%. FedEx Express international export package revenue increased double digits by 10% in Q4, primarily due to yield increase of 10%, excluding fuel and exchange rate impact yields increased 3%. Ground segment revenue also saw a double digit growth at 12% in Q4 with volume and yield each up 6% continuing the strong volume growth from home delivery and balanced volume and yield growth in commercial. Excluding fuel, yield per package increased 5%. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment increased 8%, mainly driven by our revenue quality efforts. Excluding fuel, revenue per shipment was up 6%. Revenue per shipment growth is driven by stronger rate per shipment and ongoing emphasis on revenue quality improvements.",1.489472,0.99
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,22,Remarks,2018-06-19,4,2018,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Let me now discuss some exciting new enhancements to the FedEx portfolio that will help drive our growth in fiscal year '19. First, we believe that the realignment of FedEx Trade networks that we recently is a very positive step for FedEx. It allows us to leverage the vast array of capabilities including air and ocean forwarding, supply chain and fulfillment services, cross-border capabilities, 3D printing and customized transportation solutions across the full global portfolio of FedEx. In effect, FTN becomes the forced multiplier for our business as our customers benefit from differentiated solutions for the supply chain needs. E-commerce continues to grow rapidly around the world and we continue to enhance our global portfolio to offer market leading capabilities on a global scale. During the last quarter, we acquired P2P Mailing Limited, which provides unique last-mile delivery options to more than 200 countries and territories. P2P further expands the capabilities of FedEx within the cross-border e-commerce market segment.",0.8924522,0.923

Total new delivery manager enrollments were up 50% year-over-year during fiscal year '18. We have been expanding FedEx Delivery Manager internationally, and are now in 42 countries representing 75% of the world's GDP. Additional new countries in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America will be added in fiscal year '19. E-commerce also brings significantly more returns and we have expanded our returns technology to enable e-tailers and consumers with unique visibility, flexibility and efficiency for our returns management through our FedEx office locations. We continue to enhance customer's access to our services with additional FedEx office locations including the first 50 new FedEx office locations inside Walmart stores opening in time for the upcoming peak season. We anticipate adding a total of 500 FedEx office locations inside Walmart stores over the next two years. The FedEx onsite program continues to expand with Walgreens, now the retail partners, and we already have almost 11,000 packaged pickup locations in the U.S. This program is all about convenience and brings FedEx ever closer to consumers.",1.2267574,0.863

At FedEx Express, fourth quarter adjusted operating profit hit a record $1.1 billion, up $129 million year-over-year or 13%, and their adjusted operating margin was double-digits at 11.5%. FedEx Express segment revenue growth was driven by primarily by our international business, and we had excellent growth in both international and U.S. freight services which helped drive better profitability. As you saw in the release, we are continuing to improve the efficiency and the reliability of the air network with additional orders for new aircraft that will replace older, less efficient aircraft. The deliveries of the additional 767s will begin in FY20, and the deliveries of the additional 777s will begin in FY21. The reliability of our air fleet has improved significantly and will continue to improve in this next phase of the fleet modernization program.",0.3125,0.984

On June 1, our continued -- we continued the integration of our world-class global sales teams. Our sales teams will be fully integrated in fiscal year 2019, this year of course, one year ahead of our original schedule. The technology and operational capabilities provide us with the ability to flow packages between the legacy TNT and FedEx Systems is processing as planned to allow us to flow volumes to the lowest cost or the highest service FedEx Express network in fiscal year '19, that's this year. In June we launched Economy Express 1-Day transit service in 175 lanes in Europe. These lanes were previously operated on a 2-day transit time commitment. This is a significant step in demonstrating the power of the TNT European road network and a tangible example of the benefits of our integration for our customers. Customers will benefit from more speed, more value, more coverage and of course, more choice with all of these changes. The successful integration of TNT and FedEx Express remains a key driver of the FedEx Express FY20 operating income improvement target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion over FY17's results.",1.4155891,0.986

We are improving revenue quality through a balanced approach to volume and yield growth. We've reduced our long-term capital plans for FedEx Ground to much better matched capacity expansion with pricing and volume growth. We're optimizing and modernizing in many areas to drive greater profitability. FedEx Freight's fourth quarter operating profit was also a record profit of $175 million, up $45 million and an amazing 35%. Freight's operating margin was 9.4%, exceeding all the guidance that we gave you in the last quarter.

Probably the queue be here, given the ball off to various people to answer these questions. The first one is from Helane Becker and Ken Hoexter of Cowen & BofA Merrill Lynch, respectively. Could a trade war interrupt global growth or is world trade too entrenched to allow for any disruption? So I'm going to ask Dave Bronczek to take this on.

I think more importantly perhaps, is the fact that Dave Bronczek mentioned earlier that the scale of our network is combined with the capacity that we have deployed on commercial carriers is so huge now that it makes it relatively easy for us to flex capacity as required by market demand.",0.1473923,0.907
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,44,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,How much of the $400 million impact from the cyber-attack should we assume comes back in FY19?

Question one, how much can you grow FedEx Ground volumes without adding more facilities, Elaine Becker of Cowen.

In terms of adding volume, I would say our investments in automation and technology have led us to have the most automated package sortation network in North America if not the world. And that enables us to be able to flex our capacity as needed based on market dynamics and probably the best example of that is how we handle record volumes each year at peak. Concerning margins, we expect to continue to deliver strong volume and revenue growth driven by the trends that everybody year-to-date so far has talked about by e-commerce. We're intently focused on modernizing and optimizing the ground network to drive profitability and we continue to look for ways to maximize asset utilization by leveraging existing capacity and automation. In terms of the ISP model conversion, we expect to be done sometime in late calendar 2019. We've recently announced that we were accelerating that process.",1.3027799,0.973

It's great to see -- thanks to IMO 2020 that the marine fuel sulfur will be reduced which will be a positive for the global environment. Plus, the implementation will probably raise fuel prices and we'll have to see what kind of material impact this has on the air freight demand; it's too early to tell.

FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,51,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Couple of questions on freight. Why our FedEx Freight annual margins not double-digits in such a strong LTL environment? And any investments restraining current margins? David Ross of Stifel.

I mean, we don't have any systemic problems with FedEx supply chain, we have excellent group working on there. Basic issue about the goodwill impairment was simply that we had two cell phone repair contracts; one that went to a different business model -- a warranty type model within repair, meaning more than just gave new phones. And the second, the customer decided to split the business for strategic reasons. So we've got a lot of stuff in the pipeline and supply chain will do fine.",1.5409892,0.422
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,57,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On a related area, there is a question from -- about why we moved FedEx Trade Networks out from under FedEx Express. Raj basically mentioned this but I thought I would just add some color on this. Basically, FedEx Trade Networks is now doing things for all of the OpCo's. FedEx Trade Networks is the largest customs broker in the United States, they clear things for FedEx Ground, going across the NAFTA borders, we're moving more sea freight and that sea freight is going into the FedEx Freight Network. By putting the other specialty operating companies together as Raj said, we believe that will be a forced multiplier across our OpCo's and we felt it was a better fit there. I have to tell you, we have a sort of a model of that -- what we did with FedEx office; I mean, it has been a fantastic contributor to our operating companies doing all kinds of value-added services and I'm sure that will be the case with the new FedEx Trade Network with custom critical and supply chain and forward depo's and the cross-border as interval parts of it.",1.9156504,0.944
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,58,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So now we turn to a number of financial questions related to CapEx. We have one from Ravi Shankar; given the new plains and the ongoing hub expenses, is it fair to assume that CapEx will increase in FY20 and beyond from FY19 levels? And I'll ask Alan if he will take that?",0.7920054,0.644
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,59,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We're going to continue to grow our revenues and continue to grow our cash flows, and as we see opportunities to invest -- whether it's expense, capital or acquisitions, that is going to increase the long-term value of our Company, we're going to do that. Obviously, we benefited greatly from the TCJA tax rate and 100% expensing for the next five years, that obviously makes CapEx investing less risky, although in the case of aircraft that was certainly not the driver when you're present with opportunities to make asset acquisitions at a really good price and those that are driving tremendous productivity improvements and operating expense reductions. We need to make those moves; so our CapEx is going to spike up in FY20 and FY21, mostly as a result of Express. We are significantly reducing our outlook for CapEx at Ground, we won't build a hub for a long time, Ground has many innovative and somewhat -- in some ways revolutionary cost reduction programs underway right now, all of which involves sweating assets, improving productivity and lowering costs. And the same thing at freight, so it will be easily managed. I won't say they will be able to stay at the 8% level but it will be very easily managed and covered with our cash flows and we'll still have access cash flow.",1.0822464,0.937
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,60,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So in the same vein, David Vernon wants to know as EBITDA and cash flows go up faster than the rate of CapEx which is what we've been telling which is going to happen here for a significant period of time.

Can you review the total cost of integration since acquisition and what's left after 2019? Does the benefit outweigh the cost yet? And then, Matthew Russell of Goldman Sachs asks similar question; after the $450 million in TNT integration expenses in 2019, we still have $150 million of integration expenses in 2020? Alan?",1.1080623,0.47
FDX-2018-Q4-2018-06-19,65,Answer,2018-06-19,4,2018,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So we're now little bit past two years of Day 1 with TNT and we've learned a tremendous amount. Recall, we also suffered very nasty cyber-attack a year ago, almost coming up on a year anniversary. And so our integration expenses are going to be a little bit higher than we originally thought but that's not bad at all because we'll be tightening our defenses from a cyber-standpoint and we're going to invest more than that than we had anticipated but the results will be much more productive and much more flexible IT network. Additionally, we have found additional productivity enhancers as we go through the integration that are going to really increase our returns substantially. Not to say, at FY19 when we're going to step up to about $450 million worth of integration is a very big year. We have great plans in place, we're off to a good start, and this is a key year for us in terms of integration. After '19 we'll have somewhere around $250 million to $300 million left in FY20 but that will be around the edges, I think the meat on the chicken is going to be front fiscal year that we're in.",0.1586957,0.97

The three factors that drive it first, obviously is convenience and we are right there. The locations are open later in the evening, 700 of them are open in fact 24 hours. The second issue is around porch piracy; a recent survey showed that 75% of online shoppers were concerned about porch piracy and 45% have a package either stolen or known someone that has have their package stolen.

For the quarter, adjusted earnings were $3.46 per share, up 38% year-over-year.

The way we operate with business on a portfolio basis and the way we allocate our costs depending on how we do those pricing decisions are impacting those. And I think getting down oin the weeds on that is not as important as where we are for the corporation as a whole. But as we stated in our long-term financial goals, we'll continue to target double-digit operating margins for the corporation as a whole.

Remember, we're still trying to replace old aircraft, for example, that simply could be parked and not flown during this time. We have use of other peoples' assets in our Express network that are flying traffic around for us. We have a significantly high level of purchase transportation by design as part of our expense structure. All those can be flexed down very rapidly.

We expect it to grow significantly this year and expect to see increasing free cash flow in the future as we realize returns on our network investments. We continue our strategy of balancing capital allocation with returns to shareholders. Since FY '14, we have bought back 73.1 million shares for $11 billion and increased dividend significantly this year. We expect our stock buyback program and dividend increases to continue.

Our HR planning occurs year round, our peak hiring, our efforts our year-round. I can tell you that right after the holiday season is over, we start the process in every operating company.

FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,42,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","As you saw last week, we announced the six day Ground. It's a huge issue for us and a big, big deal for our customers. We expect to gain significant capacity and volume without adding any more facilities, by shifting to a year-round six day operation. Additionally, we'll increase the focus on innovation and technology such as automation, robotics, route planning. Many of you have seen this already in our hubs and Ground and Express, significant opportunities for our employees too. We have a lot of our employees now that are very pleased with the extra hours and the flexibility to the hours. So this is a very big opportunity for FedEx.",0.3688937,0.97
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,43,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So in the same vein, how should we quantify the incremental capacity at Ground related to the six day -- to adding a six-day of operations? That's from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Dave?",0.2662602,0.452
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,44,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, it's sort of the same points I just made, Allison. For Ground, it opens up a lot of capacity and existing opportunities for our current employees to get more hours and more flexible hours. But we'll be able to handle a lot more volume without more CapEx. So it's very incremental for us on the profit side. It's really actually very good for us on service but less so the volumes flow through our network more evenly. So it was a big deal big enough that we thought we should send it out and be announcing it last week.",0.8987069,0.729
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,45,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Dave, when comparing B2C to B2B shipments within Ground, is there any meaningful difference in total transit time? Ben Hartford of Baird.",0.3682249,0.318

However, obviously, it is a difference that you see you a lot shorter zone now for B2C volume and a lot of retailers are moving their inventory closer and closer to customers, they've been doing that for many years now. It's important to note that for us at FedEx, especially FedEx Ground that the average package at Ground whether its B2B or B2C is between 64% 65% of it is delivered in two days or less for us today.",0.4428879,0.095
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,47,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And finally, Dave, can you discuss some of the differences in the degree of automation between older and newer facilities?",0.6100949,0.0
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,48,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes, I'm thrilled to be able to answer that question. And it is a big difference. We have strategically been investing, and many of you know this and many of you have seen our facilities, and I'll just use the FedEx Ground facility for example. Over the last 15 years, we put a lot of capital into these facilities where 130 plus of them are automated. And what that means is you can walk into one of our facilities, and it's the state-of-the-art technology, state-of-the-art robotics in terms of unloading, autonomous tugs, yard management systems, geo-fencing, GPS system. It's truly remarkable you'll hardly see our any employees at all. And the speed to which our package gets through our hubs now is unbelievable.

Can you discuss the current and potential impact of tariffs levied on China? That's from Chris Wetherbee of Citi and several others have similar questions.,1.5226965,0.0
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,50,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I covered some of this in my opening remarks. The China-U.S. lane bidirectionally represents roughly 2% of our total revenues. The tariffs that have been implemented so far only accounts to less than 10% of that volume. And then if new tariffs are implemented on the 200 billion dollars of import that's being considered that might impact roughly a quarter of those 2%. So that gives you a frame of reference for what we are talking about in the context of the whole enterprise. Now having said that, the uncertainty around the issue and the potential for additional tariffs is affecting the market and we're beginning to see some of the economic activity in China starting to moderate as a result of that.",0.1927438,-0.34
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,51,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,So are you seeing any supply chain adjustments from customers because of tariff concerns? That's from Matthew Russell. I hope I pronounced it right of Goldman Sachs.,0.104336,0.44
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,52,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Matthew, I think we have not yet seen any significant ships in the customer supply chain. However, if the situation continues for any amount of time, we do expect customers to diversify their supply chains and perhaps some of the trade patterns might change. And the good news here is that FedEx has got a large unparalleled global network that can flex and adjust and support our customer needs as they make their changes. I want to reemphasize the point that was made earlier by Alan and some of others that the scale and flexibility of FedEx will enable us to deliver strong results in enterprise despite any uncertainty on trades and tariffs.",0.5539359,0.925
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,53,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Raj, here is one from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Response to UPS initiatives focusing on small and midsize businesses is his question. As FedEx gain share with small and midsize businesses over the past decade. If UPS becomes more aggressive in this market segment, how might FedEx respond? Is there meaningful risk of pricing pressure in this customer segment, if both large players are focused on growing with the same group of customers?",0.0826558,0.748
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,54,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I can't directly comment on whatever competition does, but I believe the answer to your question is really yes. As I have covered in the opening remarks, small and medium segment business has been, is and will be a strong focus for us going forward and we have only accelerated in this regard. Why is that; is because we have very, very strong value proposition; we have a speed advantage; we have a very strong pricing strategy, a holistic pricing strategy; and to top it all off, we have a very strong sales and marketing team who are out executing in the competition. And as you all know, this is the most profitable segment so more business is better for us.",0.1098154,0.99
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,55,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So there are two questions here that are similar, so I am going to split this between Raj and Dave. The first part of it is from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Where are the largest opportunities for share gains with a combined TNT FedEx Network? And how far along is the combined entity in addressing those opportunities? I'd give that one to Raj.",0.2821816,0.844
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,56,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Brian, clearly the opportunities are very large. As you all may know and TNT and now FedEx has a fantastic Ground network that handles parcels and pallets in Europe. I mean TNT is a key player for intra-European ground markets and key domestic markets in Europe. Of course don't forget that TNT also has a terrific ground networks in Middle East, in Asia and Latin America. So when we combine that with FedEx's unparalleled inter-continental air system, we have a unique network that allows us to offer new value to our customers in a very cost effective manner.",0.7648202,0.942
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,57,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And that opens up large international market segments and which are now extremely well positioned to gain significant share. And the good news here is we are well on our way to unlocking the value and we are pleased with the progress. As Dave talked about, we are progressing well on the integration and customers are already beginning to see this value. And all I can say here is that the sales and marketing teams in the world are very excited to see the progress and really provide new value for our customers.",0.1347587,0.985
FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,58,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So somewhat similarly, Lee Klaskow, of Bloomberg Intelligence wants to know where the TNT integration with FedEx gives us some competitive advantage. Dave, do you want to talk about that?",0.4759485,0.727

And obviously, one of the reasons we're so interested in this, we with TNT they didn't really have the reach into the rest of their global network, that's our strength. Our global network is our strength. And so for them and for their customers, they had great Ground services, as Raj just said. In Europe, they're now accessing our global network all around the world; Europe, Latin America, Asia, Canada, United States. So really for them and for other customers and telling us this all the time, this is fantastic news for them and this is a big growth opportunity for us.",0.5905172,0.986

FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,61,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Chris, the management team feels pretty strongly that probably one of the highest uses of our free cash flow is we continue to repurchase our shares. We're very confident about where we're headed in the next three to four years in terms of improving our cash flows and our margins and our competitive positioning. We're very excited about what's going on at Ground with this existing network and selling those assets and we'll start seeing some real improvement in that in the second half of this year and on into FY '20. So I am not going to get specific, but I'd like to say it's a high priority and use of free cash flow.",0.7304348,0.963

FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,63,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"As I mentioned in previous calls, Amazon is a long-standing customer of ours. However, no one customer represents more than 3% of our revenue and Amazon is not our largest customer. Now Amazon and other customers of ours have certain elements of the logistics in-sourced to deal with capacity issues, as well as inventory management. And while there has been significant media interest in what Amazon is doing to expand their in-source deliver capability, this should not be confused as competition with FedEx. The global infrastructure, the technology, the capabilities, knowledge, they're near to compete in our business, is quite extraordinary and we have built that up over 40 plus years. I'll just point you to the video at our Web site fedex.com/dream where you can see further information in this regard. Thank you.",0.1584062,0.937

And we have a new one that's going be put up on November the 1st, called, The Day of Possibilities. But when you watch the existing video much less than new one that's coming up, which we just viewed, you are immediately struck by the incredible size and scope of the FedEx Networks. There simply is nothing like them in the world. And we have the capability to basically attack the trillion dollar plus transportation and logistics market in a unique way.

FDX-2019-Q1-2018-09-17,66,Answer,2018-09-17,1,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We're well aware that supply chains change. If you were talking about supply chains 15 years ago, you'd be talking about a lot of things that are built in China that were built in Malaysia, and so they shifted. Well, as Raj said, they may be about to shift again. But we just have these unduplicated networks, which we developed over 40 years and we're very optimistic that we can deploy the resources to continue to grow the Company and increase our financial performance. And then as Alan mentioned, within that context, we, well over the next few years be generating a substantial amount of free cash flow, which we will deploy along the lines that Alan described to you.

And clearly, the U.S.-China trade dispute that took on even greater prominence today with the administration's announcement, is worrisome to everyone. And the reason its worrisome is not because of just the individual dispute, it's because history is very, very clear that countries that pursue the most open markets are the ones that prosper the most and whose citizens' income increases the most. Mercantilism does not work. There is an example after example of it.",0.126355,-0.501

There're always parochial interests, whether it's dairy farmers in Canada or the chicken tax in the United States, which protects our pickup truck, most people don't realize it. But if you import a pickup truck in the United States, you pay 25% tariff. So overtime, the effort to try to dismantle those parochial interests has been herculean. And a lot of people over the years, the USTRs, Charlene, Barsheski, Carla Hills, Mickey Kantor, Michael Foreman and all of done the yeoman's work to do that.

Every consumer in the world almost today, billions of people, have an unprecedented order entry device sitting in their pocket, they can see the wares of the world. And when you see this new film that goes up, The Day of Possibilities, you'll see this. These small customers in Columbia, and seafood producers in Maine and companies throughout the world that are now able to access consumers, because they have the capability to buy and sell with duties and taxes explained to them with the type of software we provide them, but most importantly, our networks that connect 99% of the world's GDP in one to two business days.",0.6060298,0.525

As we've said before, we continue to be in a period of challenges and changes. Before addressing specific issues, let me thank over 490,000 FedEx team members around the world for delivering an outstanding peak season for our customers. First, let me deal with the challenges. The quarter just ended as an anomaly because of the compressed shipping season before Christmas necessitating a significant bow wave of expenses to handles volumes that will largely fall in our third fiscal quarter. In addition, this quarter has seen significant effects on the industrial economy due to continuing trade disputes, including reductions in international air freight and tepid, at best, B2B domestic parcel and freight shipping. Despite these issues, we remain highly confident in our strategies, which we believe will begin to bear fruit by our fourth fiscal quarter, and then into FY'21 absent negative macroeconomic developments.",1.2405149,0.962

In-sourcing most SmartPost volumes formally given to the Postal Service, standing up more dedicated ground large package facilities given the remarkable growth in demand for the delivery of oversized items in new unique short haul services. While these are the most visible changes, numerous other new technologies and operating processes are being deployed to ensure we can profitably deliver increasing numbers of lighter-weight residential packages. These strategies are being well-received in the marketplace with record peak package volumes, which are substantially above last year, and well over forecast with excellent service levels and high overall customer satisfaction.

Also, we are taking down intercontinental capacity right after Christmas as our hopes for a restoration in trade growth, expressed last June, has simply not materialized due to the trade disputes. Given these two major initiatives as FedEx Express rolls into FY'21, we believe we will improve profitability in the segment.

Longer-term, by fiscal '22 year end, the replacement of 159 A310 and MD-10 aircraft will be complete.

Germany's industrial sector however is still in decline. Looking ahead to calendar year '20 European GDP growth rates will likely remain in line with where they are now. In Asia, China's slowdown is expected to continue to the first-half of the year, but should have some opportunity in the back-half of 2020. Total trade between the European Union and China slowed significantly in calendar year '19 as slower growth and impacts from trade tensions have weighed on trade flows. Global trade volumes contracted year-over-year again in calendar quarter three, and will show contraction for the full calendar year.

It is imperative that while we reduce our cost to serve, we also drive higher yields to improve profitability. Capacity reductions will bring greater focus on revenue quality as we generate more compensatory volume through the network.

Our B2B business provides greater density and stronger yields than B2C, and so, we are renewing our focus on commercial traffic, which makes up a significant portion of our ground volume. However, recognizing that e-commerce is the fastest growing segment in our business, we are working to position FedEx Ground as the B2C player.

While we are encouraged by and supportive of the recent trade agreement with China, it is clear that the dynamics of trade growth have changed, and we must adapt accordingly.

These conditions are especially challenging in Europe, where capacity and network reduction opportunities are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks. As we discussed, cost headwinds at FedEx Ground are largely driven by the expansion of six and seven-day delivery due to a minimum number of employees required to staff and operate the new schedule prior to the volume and revenue coming on.

The headwinds and expansion of six and seven-day delivery, the loss of Amazon volume, and Cyber Week shifting to the third quarter accounted for approximately 60% on the Ground margin decline year-over-year. Higher self-insurance accruals also negatively impacted Ground margins by approximately 90 basis points.

Let me just start off, and then I will have Henry answer the details here, but the most important thing happened to us here was the timing. We have as we'd -- on the calendar we incurred a lot of the cost of running up to peak in Q2 with none of the revenue benefits, as we talked about, and that, you combine that with the slowing down of the commercial segment resulted in the results for Q2.

The thing I would add here is that most of the costs you're seeing is the timing of peak and the six and seven-day operation being set up. We began operating seven days a week on November 3rd, and it's going to take a while for the volume and revenue and the network to catch up and cover the expense, and I think I didn't hear the full part of your first question, but I think it had something to do with yields, and I think that, as Raj probably said, is due to mix.",0.4455297,0.214

I think - I'm not sure what else I can add other than to say that we had a run up on costs putting this seven-day operation in place, and then getting ready for peak, we're going to - there's a significant demand for seven day. We are going to be differentiated with the competition, and then the customer demand is very high, and that's going to come on post peak, and that's going to be very helpful for us, and then, annual recovery we see in the industrial segment of the economy and driving B2B, which is a renewed focus for us, that will be very helpful.

Most of the cost, 60% of the margin impact, as Alan pointed out, is the timing of peak this year, and by the way, it's a peak that's six days less than last year, so you have this volume that has to be handled in a much shorter timeline than it did last year, that takes more drivers, that takes more package handlers, that takes more line haul, et cetera, across the operation to get done, and then there is the bow wave of cost with the implementation of six and seven-day that wasn't in these numbers last year.

I don't know again how much more that Raj, and Henry, and Alan can say about it. Standing up to six and seven-day network was very expensive for us, and the expense for peak in general, which is always put up front, was a total drag. And we certainly anticipated some of it. But we probably underestimated the cost of standing it up. And then when we went into the peak season, as Raj also said, we had an unbelievable response. We had 37 million packages on Cyber Monday, and our plan was for 33 million. So we have said clearly that we believe by the fourth quarter Grounds margins will be back into the teens. We're not able to show you our spreadsheets, but that's our cost projections. And yes, there's no question, we spent more to put the network up than we thought, but we'd never put up a six or seven-day ground network before to a permanent thing.",1.4613821,0.502

But no question we missed on the cost side, but it's up and operating, as Raj said. We probably never had a response in the recent past from our ground customers, like we've had. Brie can perhaps add to that on seven-day. And it's an entirely differentiated product, and it's also something that's going to substantially change the ecommerce business. In the last weekend that just finished, we delivered over 14 million packages on Saturday and Sunday. We weren't event delivering packages on the weekend a couple of years ago.",1.0115176,0.262

And clearly, we didn't do the greatest job of forecasting our costs and we were hit with a couple of other things, like the insurance reserves which are, looking backward some period of time, that's basically because of the litigious society we live in and the more expense that's required to operate a transportation company in general, which is a huge issue to a small transportation company.

So I guess asking a ground question not related to the sixth and seventh day, but kind of thinking about your pricing commentary, both in the press release and in the 10-Q. You reference increasing pricing competition there which is sort of eroding pricing power, and we certainly saw it this quarter.

One, as Henry mentioned, the primary yield pressure, we felt at Ground in the past quarter was really due to a mix, and the pressure on our commercial business, which is obviously a very important segment to us, and that was linked directly to decrease in industrial production. When we think about revenue quality and our ability to continue to command a premium in the market, which we do in every segment that I measure, we actually get a competitive premium over the service. Number one, the seven-day value proposition is opening doors like it never has before for us. So, we really do believe that gives us great ability to negotiate.",0.0283505,0.967

So, you saw that addition what we made for large packages, but as we're managing our large customer portfolio, not all customers are equal, and we're making sure we get the B2B and the B2C bundle, and we're also making sure that when we grow with seven-day that we've got a strong mix of small business, which we have seen.

It's essentially a business of maintaining tracks and automating to the extent possible you have on OR 60% it's not labor intensive, is getting less labor intensive and when you follow the precepts of Hunter Harrison and smart railroading or whatever it wasn't calling that's what is allowing the precision railroading. That's what's allowing rails to lower their costs. They are quasi-monopolies certainly in the geographic areas, and certainly the particular customer. So I don't know that rail is significant.",1.4610434,0.785
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,66,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second part about this business is we're in many ways book to our customers for long-term relationships, and if you walk away from customers and disadvantage them and if you break the morale of your troops by not investing in service quality that has long-term deleterious effects, that certainly has been a consideration in Europe mentioned in TNT. So, of course, we could have done some more drastic things. But I think at the end of the day that the focus on the short-term, financial results are only based on what we see for the fourth quarter in the '21, and the strategies we're exercising. We have not decided to go down that road now maybe somebody else feels differently about that, but I don't think you can keep the purple promise laying off thousands of people and I think that's one of the considerations again we had in Europe just to make sure that people over there we acquired with TNT were fairly treated. We're invested and delivering the kind of FedEx service. So it's a value judgment, no question. We could have been more draconian, I guess, in certain areas. But we're, as we've said several times, pretty optimistic about where we're headed and going into January, assuming there's no more macro economic deterioration. I might also say that I think in this country, there's a little bit of miss under estimation of what's going on in the rest of the world, the e-commerce growth, the technology sector that we had, the tax cut.",1.6988482,0.93
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,67,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,All of these things have led us to have a high increasing employment. It's led us to have reasonable GDP growth that's virtually not true anyplace else in the world. And,1.8140244,0.069
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,68,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"the industrial economy, particularly in Europe, which was hit by the ricochet bullets of the U.S. China Trade War almost went into recession this time last year, and it still hasn't recovered and Germany in particular is extreme. And I think one of the things that Raj has said and Brie had said it's extremely important here, the U.S. industrial economy, which is much more tied to international trade, and of course, the GM strike and now the MAX shut down, it's been negative for months now. And so our B2B ground volume is growing, and our -- what is it John, what's our freight volume, it's up a little bit or about flat?",1.6981707,-0.834
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,70,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, and so that's the reflection of the industrial economy and in large truckload carrier, they just went bankrupt, Celadon. So it's really a tale of two, two economies. And the stock market of course is very bullish. But the industrial economy does not reflect any growth at all worldwide to speak up.",1.4359756,-0.474
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,71,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So let me, let me try to give you a little bit more kind of detail on that. First of all, couple of things we didn't mention about. Our miss here in the second quarter, we got substantially less commercial volume at Ground than we had forecast, which was a big impact. High density, higher yield, heavier packages that didn't materialize. Our commercial growth is about flat. Secondly, we operate in extremely competitive labor market these days. And we've seen wage inflation in certain markets due to increased competition for personnel. That was a little higher than we anticipated. So having said that, we are at the bottom, our adjusted operating profit decline year-over-year is horrific, and it's going to improve, it's going to improve in Q3, and it's going to improve substantially in Q4 versus the prior year's adjusted operating income, it won't be the message so bad we might, we might not be back to where we were last year, but we will be a lot closer obviously than how wildly we were in the second quarter.",1.6492754,0.426
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,72,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The other thing is, is that I think if you think about all the positive things we've said and that we're seeing, as we get into 2021, we will start lapping Amazon. We will have a lot more of the sixth and seventh day on our belt and we're going to be delivering millions of packages on Sunday for the rest of this fiscal year rolling into 2021. We will finally start getting turning the corner in Europe, with the operational synergies that we will start seeing and those will grow during the year. I've got nothing in this current range for any sort of a trade deal, because we haven't gotten one yet then we have some upside there. If that happens more, we will even have more upside into 2021. So without giving you specifics, we're at the bottom and we're going to come up off the mat and we're going to improve through the rest of this year and into the next.",1.2532609,0.708

Yes, we are actually, the commercial velocity that we're seeing in Europe is quite good. As we talked about earlier it's the best we have seen since the beginning of the integration and parcel volume growth intra-Europe and in Europe is starting to starting to park up here. So, and at the same time, we are starting to kick off our integration milestones next, as I pointed out earlier, we will by end of May of this fiscal year 2020, we are expecting to be interoperable, and then proceed on to fiscal year 2021. So, we're not waiting for the full integration to get all the benefits, we are generating those as we speak. And we are seeing the volume growth come and good commercial velocity. I'm going to turn it over to Don for any comments he may have on Europe.",0.9659864,0.977

I'm just curious and you mentioned the sales pipeline is strong, and I think it was activations were the best that they've been. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And please speak to the competitive dynamic you're facing as you're trying to re-penetrate there? Thanks.",0.068599,0.966
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,80,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Well, I think we really answered. This is Brie speaking, I think Don and Raj and I have covered most of this. I think two things, one to Don's point commercial volume intra-Europe for parcel is growing and we're very excited about that growth that has been the strongest we have seen. The next lever we really are pulling as quickly as we can is e-commerce. From a competitive comparison within our Express business that is something that our competition is ahead of us. They have about 5% to 6% or five to six times the amount of e-commerce volume that we have inter-Europe.",0.1056701,0.893
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,81,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","So that is really blowing their results. We are moving very quickly a year-ago just to put this in context. We had nine leaves on e-commerce and I'm giving you that number to show the momentum that we have. We're now actively managing 1,000 e-commerce customers through our sales type and intra-Europe alone, we have very quickly pivoted because of the economic conditions we have to grow in e-commerce and to Don's point, the European network is ready to grow from an e-commerce perspective as we've been able to improve our value proposition and grow in Europe. So number one, for growing commercially into Europe, number two, we've got strong momentum from an e commerce in Europe that's coming now.",0.0754786,0.937

So team is out there, we believe they're taking share, they're growing our business aggressively. We're hoping as both I think Fred and Alan mentioned earlier, on a more macro level of certainty that comes along with hopefully some good news on Brexit also has this, encourage although we haven't dialed that into a plan.

AB5 legislation relates to the legal test under which an individual's employment classification should be determined under California law. Since 2011, FedEx Ground is only contracted with independent incorporated companies, not individuals, and they must classify and treat their staff as employees under applicable state and local laws. So at this time, we don't believe it impacts us. Thanks.",0.7013524,0.818
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,88,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"This is Alan. Well, we've done that; we were asked earlier about there is some big bold move. I don't think you have any idea how big 8% reductions of flight hours is, but it's tremendously large. We're not going to grow our fleet. We're just replacing it. We're tightening it. Tighten it up, and reducing flight hours. Express's domestic margins are fine. So, it's the international that we got to keep working on, we've been dragged down by TNT. Some of it self-inflicted, some of it macro, we're handling the flight hours, I think we're doing everything that we can that we should be doing. Well, our CapEx is going to drop significantly after we get the past FY'22. As I said, those of our essential aircraft replacements, which we need, if we're flying more flight hours, then we will be retiring MD-11 faster than we anticipated, but we don't expect any growth there beyond that. I think a 6% to 7% of persona revenue in '23 and beyond will start to show a significant improvement in our ROIC and ROE. So as I look out there, again it's, I'm frustrated I'm sure. Our investors are frustrated. We're here at the bottom but we can see a way out.",1.4007246,0.586

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, getting exactly those details, because it depends on what the flight hours are and everything else, it's a significant number. And at the same time, we expect to be improving the revenue quality on it significantly, so we should get it from the top line and the bottom-line, and I'll turn it over to Don, and then -- he's been leading the planning on this, and I think it's outstanding.",1.7847826,0.896

I just want to follow-up on the flight hour's question. So, we estimate that from public data that about half your pilot will retire over the next decade, and I'm just kind of wondering, (a), the pilot hiring and your ability to attract female pilots to the company, and (b), how much of the reduction in flight hours is the result of the pilot retirements?",0.8579368,0.859
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,95,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me start off from this and have Don speak to. This is Smith speaking. First of all, when the economy started deteriorating a year ago in Europe, and we were hopeful for trade deals as we went on the fiscal year as we expressed to you in the June Analyst Call. We began to put constraints on pilot hiring, and we have not been hiring pilots for some time now. On an attrition basis, I believe, Don and Greg Hall, our Head of Air Operations told me that we will have a net reduction of several hundred pilots next year just due to retirement, and of course, that corresponds to the flight hour reduction. So, this is something that we've been thinking about for long time if things didn't materialize.",1.3086043,0.511
FDX-2020-Q2-2019-12-17,96,Answer,2019-12-17,2,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In terms of female pilots, FedEx had been a leader in this. This has been something that's been a project of mine for a long time, female and minority pilots we percentage-wise at one point I'm far away from the Express business, this level of details, at one time we had the highest percentage of both. I'm sure that's different now, but we work very hard, and we participate in female and minority hiring longer term. We are among the prize jobs in the aviation industry, and we do not have any problems hiring aviators today, but in the future with the military releasing, so few of them, that may be a different story, but Greg has done a great job for Don developing Grow Your Own Pilot Program. So, we put a lot of thought in this. Our pilot attrition is going down, and so we anticipated this. Raj, Don you want to say…",1.6961382,0.933

FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,95,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we have a number of questions surrounding the peak surcharge and peak season pricing and yields in residential e-commerce. So Ari Ashe of Transport Topics asked this week, your chief rival, UPS, announced a $0.27 to $0.97 package fee during the Christmas holiday season. Does FedEx plan to do the same thing?",0.4813686,0.505
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,96,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"From Christian Wetherbee of Citi, will you implement a similar initiative around peak season pricing as UPS announced yesterday? How positive a sign is it that UPS is beginning to push harder on price? And from David Vernon of Bernstein, how much room does the company see in its ability to drive up yields in residential e-commerce? And what are the driving or constraining factors? So I'll ask Raj to deal with all those.",1.2120596,0.782
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,97,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Okay. As I've mentioned before, we are continuing to work on several different options for peak pricing, but we have not made a final decision in this regard. I'm not ready to make an announcement yet.",0.1020408,-0.299
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,98,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"In terms of overall revenue volume and yields, we continue to focus on our pricing strategy as it allows us to balance volumes and increase yields across the portfolio. And again, to that question, all I can say is our results speak louder than any words that I can use.",0.2795594,0.318
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,99,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So questions from Lee Klaskow of Bloomberg Intelligence. Is the Freight network better suited to handle, I think, the large, oversized shipments? Are you pushing those shipments through that network?",0.1327913,0.748
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,100,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I guess, the answer to that is it depends on the nature of the shipment. I - it's clear when we get them whether it should be a Ground shipment or a Freight shipment. We do have value-added services in the Freight sector. Mike, you want to speak this?",0.3733062,0.44
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,102,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now we are at FedEx Freight acquiring a significant number of the smaller 24 foot straight trucks with lifts because a fair amount of FedEx Freight shipments are going into neighbourhoods, and those are more compatible. So as the market turns more towards these oversized deliveries, I think you'll see FedEx Freight lean into that space in a big way.",1.3858401,0.649
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,103,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"David Ross of Stifel wants to know, are you approaching this year's peak season in U.S. any differently than in prior years, if so, how, if not, why not? I'll ask Raj to speak to that. All I would say is, as I said in my remarks, we had the best peak season in terms of service in the company's history, so our operations folks did a great job of planning for it. Raj?",0.1212737,0.865
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,104,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Well, I have nothing much more to add than to say that we continue to work directly with our - some of our key customers in terms of making sure we have the right forecast for peak season so we can provide outstanding service. By the same token, we're also working with a small number of large customers that drive the majority of the surge.",2.4178814,0.827
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,105,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And so we should at least make sure that we have the appropriate pricing in place, so we get compensated for the investments we make as well. And as I said before, we continue to look at other changes, but no decision has been made in that regard.",0.1911241,-0.153
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,106,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we have 3 questions about Ground margins, one from Jack Atkins of Stephens, similar 1 from Christian Wetherbee of Citi and Scott Group with Wolfe, who had previous questions, so we'll say this as a Jack Atkins, Stephens question. So Henry, Ground margins?",0.3539973,0.0

FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,108,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we have a question from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. For the past decade, FedEx appeared to focus on achieving high volume growth, especially in the Ground segment. However, in the past year, pricing appears to have accelerated, while volume growth has been slower. Was this by design? Let me take that. Of course, it was by design.",0.2625339,0.637
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,110,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Well, I'd take the Chairman's prerogative of getting those puzzlers. How much incremental pricing opportunity exists with customers before incentivizing a shift to other competitors? Well, Brandon, that's the nature of the beast. I mean, we're constantly trying to get that maximization between volume and yield. We have lots of pricing science.",0.3604336,0.827
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,111,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"On many occasions, I've told folks that come to visit us at FedEx, when they ask what are they missing, and I generally say that. You miss the extreme sophistication of the pricing that we have inside our marketing group under Raj. And so we're constantly tweaking that.",0.6378726,-0.422
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,112,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Second thing I'd like to point out, which I'm sure sounds like a broken record to many of you, is we do not manage FedEx Corporation to achieve the maximum results in any quarter or even any fiscal year in all segments. We manage it as a portfolio. In fact, we were talking the other day in our Strategic Management Committee that we now have 240 different services of 1 sort or another.",1.0149051,0.494
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,113,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Ground was really knocking out of the park for a number of years, and we used the opportunity when Dave was the CEO of Express to make enormous improvements in the Express network, including an indigenous expansion in Europe. And we had the opportunity to make the TNT acquisition, which we did.",0.3533198,0.802
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,114,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the Express margins are widening now, and I have said for the last several years, and I think we have proven this, that we expect all of our activities at the corporation level to improve margins, cash flows, EPS and returns on investment. And we have done that. And I said it again today, which I would remind you about for FedEx Corporation.",0.3038618,0.44
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,115,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So here's another one on large items in the Ground network, increased investments for gym equipment and furniture in Ground. You want to speak to that, Henry?",0.0406504,0.34
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,116,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There's another one here from - that was a repeat question, I think, from Jairam Nathan about progress in automating jobs being done manually, and in particularly in FedEx Ground loading and unloading of trucks. So why don't you combine the 2 of those and speak to them?",1.12229,0.422
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,117,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Henry Maier,,"Okay. This is Henry Maier. As Raj said, we continue to see large-sized packages continue to grow. That's just the nature of e-commerce. We are making investments in material handling and lifting technologies to address that. We review hub designs over the normal course of business that account for package size. So that would divert packages, for instance, that we would have to handle manually today to a more automated mode.",0.8422239,0.226

FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,119,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Henry Maier,,"Well, I would say that FedEx Fulfillment is executing our expectations. We, on June 6, opened up a second facility in Fontana, California, which gives FedEx Fulfillment customers the ability to reach 94% of the U.S. population in 2 days or less. And we will continue to grow those facilities in capacity as customer demand dictates.",0.743426,0.459

FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,121,Answer,2017-06-20,4,2017,Henry Maier,,"Yes, as a matter of fact, there was. There was one customer loss that lapped the year there, so nothing out of the ordinary there. We make those portfolio decisions all the time at the FedEx Supply Chain.",0.7276484,0.128
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,122,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"There were numerous questions from various folks, some of whom were second and third questions about the implications of e-commerce packages picked up from stores and what the implications are for FedEx. We move many, many millions of items in the stores today, packages and pallets.",1.1565041,0.0
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,123,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And some of them, I'm sure, are picked up, and the vast majority of them are sold off the shelves. And similarly, we move a lot from fulfillment centers straight to customer's doors. So I think there is, quite frankly, this view of what FedEx does through the lens of e-commerce and particularly, residential or individual e-commerce. And the company is certainly involved in that, but the bigger story is the enormous upstream network operated by FedEx. And there's only one other one of a similar size and scope, and that is UPS.",0.5159214,0.422
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,124,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Of course, DHL is really big internationally but not so big in the U.S. anymore. So for those of you who've never seen it, I'd invite you to go to fedex.com/dream and punch on the e-commerce film down there. I think it's about 2 minutes and 30-some seconds, and you will see the size and scope of the upstream networks of FedEx.",0.0765583,0.226
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,125,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And what the basic business of this company is along with our value-added logistic services is to pick up, transport and deliver from any address in the world to any other address in 1 to 2 business days. And I think we're connecting something like 92% plus of the world's GDP in that fashion. So several quarters ago, I talked about Metcalfe's Law, and that upstream network is the primary value add that FedEx brings. These days, because of the marvellous e-commerce revolution, almost all of the focus is on last-mile and residential deliveries.",2.0165989,0.599
FDX-2017-Q4-2017-06-20,126,Question,2017-06-20,4,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And there, the largest player is the United States Postal Service, and they are the biggest provider of retail light packages to homes done in conjunction with mail delivery. So a lot of these things get very jumbled up, and so we can't answer your questions because the questions don't correspond to the way the real world is.",0.2029133,0.422

There was some question here about overnight box volumes declined 5%. That was due to one customer who changed their distribution pattern. Yes, I think that we'll sort of kind of end up here with one question. I'll let Alan do it. Again, there are a couple of questions about Ground expansion, but I think we basically answered all of those. You want to add something, Raj?",0.6788618,0.654

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The net impact of the cyberattack on Q1 operating income was predominantly lost revenue, much of which dropped to the bottomline due to the fixed cost nature of the TNT Network. Also we incurred incremental third-party costs related to the recovery effort. Reduced international earnings from the cyberattack also increased our effective tax rate for the quarter. Based on all these factors, we analytically determine the net impact on operating income to be approximately $300 million.",0.7413043,0.44

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Because the net impact was primarily related to revenue transactions that did not occur, the financial effects of the cyberattack are reflected in our adjusted earnings.

FDX-2018-Q1-2017-09-19,158,Answer,2017-09-19,1,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So my guess is that everybody that's in the e-commerce business is seeking to develop greater route densities one way or another. The Walgreens on-site locations that we just mentioned, all of the efforts that Amazon is making, UPS is making and so forth. So I think at the end of the day, all of this is going to rationalize itself over the next few years. E-commerce is not going to eliminate the retailing sector of the country.

It's certainly going to grow as a percentage, but will it be half, I doubt it and the business courier, anybody in this room, will it be 20% per day, 18% per day, who knows.

I think you're going to see e-tailers become more brick-and-mortar and I think you're going to see brick-and-mortar become more e-tailers. And how that all shakes out, I don't know, but we believe as a management team that we have the assets in place to be able to participate in these markets extremely well and we just have to, as Alan said, make sure we keep it in balance.

I'm not going to comment on the market share directory other than to say that dimensional weight pricing is a very common industry practice and it allows us to make the best use of space in our aircraft and vehicles, and also encourages our customers to make packaging adjustments.

This comes from Kevin Sterling of Seaport Global. The strength we are seeing in air freight and the international export market. Is it more cyclical or are we seeing a structural change that you believe is more permanent?

It's driving -- what is come -- the manufacturing especially in the technology sector is a key driver of this trend for this year. We expect that to be continue for the rest of the year.

As a result, we have lowered our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance and our accelerating actions to reduce costs, given the uncertainty of global macro economic trends.

And third, we believe new productivity enhancing tools from accounting box, legal system analytics and predictive AI et cetera will allow us to operate our company with fewer staff positions going forward. Of course, we expect overall FedEx employment to increase over the next several years, again, assuming moderate economic growth.

The peak for global economic growth now appears to be behind us. Eurozone growth has slowed from 2.5% last year to under 2% in the second half of 2018, and economic growth in the UK has slowed sharply since July. The secular slowdown in Chinese economy has been exacerbated by trade tensions. Spillover effects from these tensions and the fading tech cycle have negatively impacted growth throughout Asia. Emerging Asia growth slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in Q3. World trade slowed in Q3 to just 3.5% compared to 5.3% in Q3 2017.

We continue to grow just at not the rate that we were hoping to grow in accordance with the slowing economy that has affected our growth, but we are not shy of volume or growth. The reality is, however, the TNT when we bought that company they had a tremendous value proposition in their freight products and their specialty service.

FDX-2019-Q2-2018-12-18,87,Answer,2018-12-18,2,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I think it's also important to recognize and again there is this significant misunderstanding. The Amazon Air network is set up to move inventory within the Amazon system which is prodigious. It's big. It moves not in stock in low turn SKUs and forward stock items for their third-party customers who can't duplicate inventory and replace. So it's scheduled differently, and FedEx or UPS System, there's a very good analysis of this that came out from David Vernon of Bernstein.

Scott Group of Wolfe Research, International volumes were up 5% year-over-year and international yields were flat.

There is no question about the fact that I made in my comments that, one of the things that TNT really did very well and we continue to do well with TNT inside FedEx is the freight products and their specialty freight products. So after the cyber attack that product came booming back, because no one's better than we are in that product.

And so we can adjust and we will. And one of the great things about promoting our head pricing guide to a P&L as see now it carries a whole lot more about yields at Express than we did in the past.

We'll tell you more about in calendar 2019. But I think to some degree it's our success in attacking the pallet business that is creating the problem. I mean, we've been aggressive in this area and it's growing and some of the more additional areas where we have a higher market share, it's been affected by the macroeconomic issues that have created this mix issue. But we'll have a lot more to say about it in March, and I know that's difficult for people to follow the earnings of companies on a quarterly basis to equity.

Many of the observers of this industry continue to misrepresent the total package market by double counting the postal packages, many of which are given to them for direct injection by FedEx smart post UPS share post and Amazon direct injection. So that is the so-called parcel select service, which has been in place since 1997.

So many times you will see where FedEx is going to handle this many packages from peak and UPS is going to handle this many packages from peak. And the Postal Service is going to handle this many packages for peak. A lot of the postal packages are actually FedEx SmartPost and FedEx SurePost. Now, that's not the case of speaking with you UPS SurePost. Now that's not the case for Priority Mail of course, which is the Postal Service and the end product or first class package service, which was introduced a year ago, I'll recall, it was moved a package product that was previously in the regulated non-competitive sector over into the competitive sector give the Postal Service more pricing freedom, but those are like the small craft packaging you get prescription drugs and/or small cosmetics or vitamins or something like that.",0.7422087,0.892

Postal Service put a different way as we have said many times as very little in the way of upstream network capabilities.

In this case when one of our competitors was having some difficulty we did, and we moved it in our network, because we knew we can provide outstanding service. So our FedEx freight team did a great job of handling that. In that case, we did take that part of the business.

But outside of Europe TNT fantastic ground network in Middle East and Asia and Latin America. And when you combine those networks with FedEx, it's just unmatched intercontinental air system. We now have a unique network that allows us to offer new value to our customers in a very, very cost-effective manner. And this allows us to now target multiple and large international market segments and we are very well positioned to expand this service offerings, including Asia to point out. For instance, the largest air cargo lane in the world is Asia to Europe, but the capabilities that we just talked about, we are now extremely well position to win in this market markets and segments that I just talked about.",0.5046971,0.933
FDX-2019-Q2-2018-12-18,104,Answer,2018-12-18,2,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So let me add Raj's comments. I was down in Southeast Asia recently Raj happened to be with me. And I think he will agree the Southeast Asian road network, we have is just unmatched our position in Singapore.

So, we have said earlier strategic plans where we think we can pack a larger addressable market and can throw FedEx even in a low growth environment. Now, we've said repeatedly today obviously when you have a change, it comes on you as fast I just did it's hard to react to it. But I have a very timely question in that regard from Helane Becker of Cowen said, over the next five years, is it possible that while rhetoric from politicians continues to be protection focused companies will ignore it and continue to grow internationally?",0.251355,0.649
FDX-2019-Q2-2018-12-18,106,Answer,2018-12-18,2,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So let me answer that question from a broader perspective. The most important thing that is different about today than has ever been through in the history of the world is billions of people, and more being added every day are equipped with a personal order entry device, mobile and telephone. And you can now access the goods of the world and see them compare and shop.

And I think the profundity of that will in the end create demand on an ongoing basis just like it has been for time immemorial for human beings wanting to travel and trade. This type of bottom-up commerce is completely changing the politics for instance in Africa and in parts of Latin America, which often have been politically mismanaged, but now people are not as dependent on the patriarchal or the political class.

FDX-2019-Q2-2018-12-18,108,Answer,2018-12-18,2,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And I'll just conclude by saying most of the issues that we are dealing with today are induced by bad political choices. Making a bad decision about a new tax, creating tremendously difficult situation with Brexit, the immigration crisis in Germany, the mercantilism and state owned enterprise initiatives in China, the tariffs that the United States put in unilateral. So you just go down the list and they are all things that have created macroeconomic slowdown. The good news is with a change in policy, they could turn it around pretty quick too.

No question, lot of stocking took place across the Pacific in advance of the 1st of January. And so as Alan, I think mentioned, I mean we are rigged for silent money here on the submarine. We think that the first quarter we'll see some ripple effects of that. But China is a manufacturing powerhouse, just looking today's Wall Street Journal, this fantastic group, so charts that show that. So I think hopefully the political folks will get it right and freight growth will resume.

But China is working very hard to go upstream on the value chain, which again the charts in today's Wall Street Journal Show. So, I don't think there's going to be any wholesale move of manufacturing out of China.

One, part of the rationale for this acquisition is that, this is required by California Regulation. Second, these are Chinese vehicles Chanje is, I think the way we pronounce the manufacturer name. They look to be terrific. You need to recognize that China by law requires all large heavy public vehicles to become electric in the next few years. So, they are the market leader in buses around the world in the automotive sector, not so much success, but in these heavier vehicles.

They're doing an unbelievable job. We're very proud to be their partners. Certain markets are experiencing some higher labor costs due to increased competition for people and it affects the service providers, both line haul and pickup and delivery as it does in the other business.

How many complaints about anybody on this call that we didn't answer any questions that you might have, really. How do you see the push toward one day shipping by the e-tailers affecting capacity?

But I can just say that the push is no surprise for us and we are well prepared not only the impact of capacity, but also the cost to serve.

First, the formation of FedEx data works and new organizations focused on putting our data into context and using it to transform the digital and physical experience of our customers and team members. Second is a recently announced agreement to acquire ShopRunner. This platform will accelerate our ability to play a larger role in e-commerce by connecting brands and merchants to new shoppers, thus improving online shopping experiences. ShopRunner's existing customer brand and merchant base, product capabilities and team of professionals will drive significant value as we expand our e-commerce portfolio.

Second quarter adjusted operating income increased 121% year-over-year, primarily due to international priority volume growth of 32%, continued strong demand for U.S. residential delivery, pricing initiatives, operating margin improvements across all our transportation segments and a $70 million benefit from a reduction in aviation excise taxes provided by the CARES Act. These factors were partially offset by higher costs driven by the package volume surge and expanded service offerings at FedEx Ground, an approximate $215 million year-over-year increase in variable compensation expense, and an approximate $50 million in COVID-19-related costs to ensure the safety of team members and customers.",0.3793657,0.976

However, based on the current trends in our business, we anticipate increased demand to result in higher year-over-year revenue and operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Express for the remainder of fiscal 2021.

Insane growth there, and I know that there's a lot of investments going on to make sure all the packages get delivered. Right now, it's only showing about a 10% incremental margin, and everybody wants to get back closer to mid-teens.

Well, as Mike said, margins in the second quarter improved to 110 basis points and operating income improved 61% year-over-year. Given the very unique environment leading up to peak, our resource ramp-up looked very different than it had in prior years. Peak preparation expenses were much higher and occurred much earlier than in the past as we anticipated the potential impacts of COVID on resource availability and the timing of customer volume coming into the network.",0.8392186,0.881

In fact, we are still onboarding record numbers of package handlers as we speak. We recognize new challenges for service providers and adding drivers and vehicles.

Firstly, just to put it in perspective here, the technology and the talent are very critical components of this, and the fact that the technology platform that connects brands and merchants to consumers is very important. The important thing also is the combination of those capabilities with FedEx's capability is our physical and digital infrastructure. And we have -- ShopRunner being an established e-commerce platform that directly connects online shoppers with brands and merchants that they love and trust offering member benefits and the seamless checkout, and you combine that together with our goal to create a more open collaborative e-commerce ecosystem that benefits merchants and shoppers.

We're very excited about the ShopRunner acquisition and having Sam and his team join us. We have some interesting product capabilities that I'm not going to be able to share all the details at this point. But, I think, the three things from a go-to-market and a value driver that we see in the very near-term as we're looking at the ShopRunner acquisition, the first is that we have the logistics capabilities to create greater certainty with the existing ShopRunner offering to consumers. We can work with their brands to make the reality even more efficient on their current offering.",0.7131811,0.972

FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,90,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, let me start by saying that we are excited about our performance across all our segments of the business this quarter.

FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,91,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"If we look at -- obviously, the fastest-growing segment is e-commerce. And as we improve the -- continue to improve density and other metrics in our systems and the performance is going to continue to even get better. But to your point, the industrial production and the business segment is just recovering and that there's upside opportunity here, inventory, the sales ratio is at an all-time low for retail, and it is about six-year low for manufacturing. So as they come back and then the restocking happens over the next few months, that should be an upside to the core business as well.",1.8170732,0.856
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,92,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we are excited about the progress we have made in the e-commerce space, growing very fast in that space, and the investment that we made is actually filling right into it. At the same time on the international segment, we're seeing -- we are -- clearly capacity that we provide today is at premium. We expect that advantage to continue. And as businesses continue to recover and the B2B segment comes back, that should be on top of our current trends. So, that's what we expect. And COVID-19 is choppy in the immediate short term, but the medium term, we're optimistic about where these trends are going. I don't know, Brie, if you want to add to that?",0.9874661,0.849

I think, the only other detail that I would add is we're not quite there yet from a recovery from a B2B perspective. We have seen strong momentum and some early, early signs coming out of Europe. That's obviously where it's most important to us from a business mix perspective. And my hat's off to the European team.

As we look at the United States, yes, the B2B started to go into positive direction at the beginning of Q2 and it strengthened over the quarter. And as you said, the industrial production has started to lap the pandemic crisis here and then coming back on the other side. Across the world, China is leading the way in terms of economic recovery and manufacturing, and Europe is lagging behind. So, in Europe, we've seen growth, but it's finally driven by B2C. And the B2B is still in the recovering but below pre-pandemic levels. So, Don, do you want to comment on the international segments?",1.8428895,0.751

The increase in facilities which -- that would be both, new automated facilities, as well as expansion of existing ones, that's not the only lever we have and are working on to improve Ground margins and profitability. We also will continue to deploy technology to further enhance that asset productivity, as well as deeper collaboration with our customers to optimize when, where, and how we receive the shipments.

I think, the point about when the capacity, supply and demand for us to balance is of course, we have to look at that. We feel that as the demand comes back, the capacity will be in shortfall for quite some time, and our FedEx capacity will be at significant premium. And, as Brie pointed out in our remarks there is quite a bit of runway ahead of us in this regard. So, let me turn it over to Don for his comments.",0.595724,0.361

The question is on cash flows, if you don't mind. There's been a significant improvement in operating cash flow through the first six months of this year on year-over-year basis. It looks like a good portion of that is from a lower payables. Is that related to the payroll tax accrual holiday related to CARES Act, first of all? And then, I guess more broadly, with an increased focus on CapEx discipline now, do you anticipate being sustainably free cash flow positive moving forward, barring something unforeseen from a macro perspective?

FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,113,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Michael C. Lenz,CFO,"Jack, the answer to your first question is, two big drivers of that. We made a $1 billion contribution to our pension plan in the first half of last year. And then, you are correct, the deferral of the payroll taxes into the CARES Act shows up there. At this point, the benefit from that we've deferred just north of $600 million of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. And those will pay back in calendar '21 and '22.",0.6812525,0.877

I think, the important thing here is to think about residential is, you got to focus on the transformational initiatives that have been accomplished and the ones that are yet to come. We talked about 7-day year round 95% of the U.S. population.

FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,124,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","So, we're going to continue to execute on our revenue quality strategy. We think that there's been some fundamental shifts in the market. And you saw the beginning of that this quarter with a 20% increase in our SmartPost products and a 10% increase from a yield and the residential business. We believe surcharges will be a part of our pricing strategy moving forward for e-commerce. They are a necessary part. We also are going to continue to work on our product and our customer segment mix. And what do I mean by that? We are leaning into our home delivery product for growth. It is the best value proposition in the market. No one else can do 7-day. And we expect to continue to get a premium. We also expect that that will continue to drive market share from small and medium customers who cannot move to a local operation. And they really do value the national speed advantage that we have.",0.1535346,0.945

I am highly confident of double-digit margins. I don't know whether I want to get into a debate with anybody on this call about teams, so.",1.6860699,0.585

The over -- we have moved over more than 10 million packages from Express to Ground, primarily. These are primarily -- I mean, these are rural and residential packages that because of e-commerce and the ability for us to have a definite system of lower -- the definite system, more than 10 million packages into the Ground system. In addition, FedEx Freight has done a lot of work for FedEx Ground as well. They've driven 40 million miles, up 80% year-over-year. There were 1.5 million packages that Freight has delivered -- handled packages, up more than 435%. There are several such numbers, but the collaboration is very active. And we are making sure that we put the right package in the right network and the right cost to serve.",1.2397149,0.878

FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,137,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Michael C. Lenz,CFO,"Hey Allison, it's Mike. So, I don't have a specific number to give you on that as we are, as I said, in the midst of formulating our plans and putting it together for FY22. But, unquestionably, the sustainability and acceleration of the e-commerce business that we have seen that everybody has highlighted is here to stay. And Brie spoke of this tremendous shift in the mix of residential business and with not much advanced notice, yet Ground has quickly adapted, adjusted and was able to increase margins. So, that's a testament to the execution of the team on all fronts, the commercial teams, the operational teams. So, that volume is going to keep coming. So, it's essential that we do invest in certain assets going forward, but it's not going to be the same nature and configuration as you might historically have considered it. So, I mentioned, it's facilities, it's technology, it's how we work with customers. But I'll let Henry elaborate a little bit more on just kind of the nature of the facilities and how that works, so you have a better sense of it.",0.461662,0.763
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,138,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"Yes. Thanks, Mike. Allison, I think, the way you should think about this is we're going to invest much more heavily on the edge of our business, which is the last mile space. So, if you think about this, our focus is going to be on much smaller automated satellites and stations, regional sortation facilities, which, if you're not aware, sort about 12,000 to 15,000 packages an hour. They tend to be inbound only so that we can process direct loaded volume from large retailers. They are much less costly to build and operate because what we do is we go in and we modify an existing building. And we are able to get these up much quicker. In fact, the time to get them up and running is measured in months instead of years, like some of the bigger construction projects we've had. They're solely designed for the sortation of regional packages. And I think when you think about regional, you should think about overnight mainly. And one of the great advantages they have is that they can serve as a relief valve for spillover sortation at peak.",0.2539444,0.949
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,139,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"There is a lot of other levers we can pull here. The ideal situation for us is to be able to load direct van, not have to go through a destination facility. We're investing heavily in technology tools that will give us the ability to do that. There's a lot of things we do, particularly this time of year at peak with mobile docs and annexes and the ability to waive dispatch and run dual pre loads in facilities that allow us to dual use facilities when volume is at the level it is now that don't require us to invest in the traditional brick and mortar.",0.8812923,0.836
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,140,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"Now, all that being said, we're always going to have brick and mortar in our business, but many of the transformational initiatives I've talked about are intended to give us better real-time information about what's coming so we can make decisions that reduce our input costs. The main area would be re-handles so that we can bypass the brick and mortar facility altogether and load right to a vehicle that's going to go deliver those packages in the neighborhood. So, I hope that answers your question.",0.9192337,0.846
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,141,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"And Allison, that's density yet again. You've heard us say it numerous times, but that is density and how we manage that yet again.",1.2737285,0.0
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,144,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"Okay. I'll take the first part, and then, I'll let Brie take the second. But, let me talk about peak. First of all, we haven't actually had a conversation about that. And since we're in the midst of it, let me begin by saying I couldn't be prouder of the Ground team and what they've been able to accomplish this year, just like about everything else in 2020, which has been an extraordinary year. Peak this year has been pretty extraordinary.",0.8595041,0.912
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,145,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"All the things I talked about in terms of investments, resources, capacity, are all really driving one of the best peak seasons we've ever had, in spite of COVID and all the other challenges we've had in this business. On average, FedEx Ground is delivering 25% to 30% of the volume a day early, and the average package spends about 2.4 days in the network in terms of transit, which is faster than last year, in spite of the volume and the challenges I outlined.",0.7877536,-0.25
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,146,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"I think, the issues this year on the cost side were timing and a lot of unknowns. I talked about the building -- the facilities came on much later this year because most governments were shut down for two months. So, we couldn't get permitting that really slowed the time line here. And even though our property and engineering team did a fabulous job in the race to the finish line here to get them up and running, facilities came on a lot later this year than normal.",1.2370398,0.527
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,147,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"In terms of the resources, particularly in the case of handlers, I would just say two things. When you bring on resources at the rate we're bringing them on, they are not very efficient. It takes time for these people to be taught their job. And there's this ramp-up of 2, 3, 4 weeks it takes for a handler to learn their job. And once again, I mean, we've got a sizable portion of the handler workforce that is not as productive as they could be.",0.8846732,-0.371
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,148,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"I think, I said on the call at the end of Q1 that our facilities are not designed for social distancing. So, out of an abundance of caution in keeping safety above all in our business, we've got a staff and man these buildings in such a way that we can keep our people safe while they're at work. The unintended outcome of that is, is that we don't get the desired or engineered throughput through all these buildings we would in the time pre-COVID.",0.974831,0.778
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,149,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"So, those are the things that are probably most material to the cost side of this. As I said, also in the earlier question, we pulled peak settlement for our service providers forward because we knew they were going to have challenges with the recruitment of drivers. And we recognized early on that vehicles were in short supply. Once again, automotive manufacturing plants were shut down for two or three months. And new and used vehicles in the market right now are almost impossible to find. That meant that rental vehicles had to be procured much earlier and with commitments that were much longer than normal. And we made adjustments to settlement in those situations to try to defray some of the costs for our service providers.",1.0462059,0.202
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,150,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Henry Maier,,"Finally, let me just say one last thing. Our ISPs have done an unbelievable job this year at peak. I've lost track for the number of days we've had peak package delivery days, peak stop days, et cetera, and they have stepped up every step of the way this year. And I would reinforce again that the ability and flexibility of those small businesses to make decisions on the fly based on local conditions and the data we push to them about what their delivery is going to look like the next day, there's nothing short of unprecedented and is truly a differentiator in our business.",1.256574,0.772

Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","And to answer the second half of your question, I think, Jill Brannon and her sales team have just done an incredible job leveraging our weekend capacity. The incentive is, you use the weekend or you lose the capacity. And that has worked. Do we have opportunity? Yes, I believe we have incremental opportunity to further improve the productivity and density on the weekend. But again, we have created a peak capacity strategy that does require customers to pulse their volume more equally throughout the week. And our best largest customers are doing just that with us. They've been great partners and I think they'll continue to see us do a good job of out of peak moving forward.",0.3376289,0.966
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,154,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Sure. We really were hoping to change shopping behavior, and we really didn't see that to be completely honest. We have seen, as a result, I think there's far more awareness from consumers of the unprecedented year we're having. What we did see is the ground team and the sales team did such a great job educating the merchant and the customer that we saw a lot better planning. And as a result, we saw volume, and we are seeing volume earlier in the Express network. So, it was successful and that we were able to move some of the higher value e-commerce into the Express network. And we have been successful in smoothing day of week within Henry's network. We were not successful in getting all consumers to shop before the cyber weekend. So, that remains a goal, let's just say.",0.4749632,0.984
FDX-2021-Q2-2020-12-17,157,Answer,2020-12-17,2,2021,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","I would say, in general, the conversations have gone very well. The largest and most successful retailers in the U.S., they understand how important FedEx Logistics is to -- quite frankly to their growth strategy. And so, I think we've had some tremendous success. I do want to be clear on the SmartPost. It was about trading out as well. That's a big part of the strategy. So, the customers that understand the value we bring, they've been great partners, and that's enabled us to move forward. And for those who don't value our speed and our differentiated value proposition, as you can see in our growth numbers, there were lots of customers who did value that. So, it's not a one-size-fits-all. But overall, I would say that the team has done a great job and that come January, we've already had a -- we have a full -- Jill's calendar for January is full as she moves into peak planning for next year, and I think this year has set new precedence for many years to come.",0.1638439,0.989

Fiscal 2019 was a year of both challenge and change for FedEx. We faced weakening international revenue growth, driven by the slowdown in global trade, less favorable service mix of TNT Express business after the NotPetya cyber attack and continued rapid growth of e-commerce demand.

We expect to be substantially complete with the operational integration by the end of fiscal year 2020.

FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,91,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"That's was three, Scott. So look as the cadence the tax rate is going to be really spotty. I mean, we've got a lot of assumptions that we have to prove and get through, we're still looking at all of these pages of interpretations and regs that are coming out left and right. We're dealing with B, we are dealing with GILTI, you've probably heard this from everybody that you follow international is extremely complex. So tax rate is going to be a factor in our quarter-to-quarter numbers, don't be surprised by that.",0.1206522,0.226
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,92,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Secondarily, again, I just can't tell you what's going to happen from the global economic standpoint, so that piece of it, the cadence is going be the cadence it's a little bit out of our control, we will manage to it. But we don't want to do anything stupid and then not have the capacity that we need in the right place. So we are watching that extremely carefully.",0.1818841,-0.32
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,93,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"You asked the Ground, they are going to have a great year. I mean, they really are, they are going to grow, they are going to grow fast and if we can hold margins or get closer to holding margins on this growth with all the expansion and all the investments that they're doing and improving productivity, they are going to be ready to roll in 2021,they are going to have a very consistent year, so that's about all I can tell you.",0.7902174,0.908
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,94,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The other thing is that people forget that there is a reason that Express has a two days service it's called distance, when we need an airplane, we need an airplane, the customer really decides which network makes the delivery. I think we've explained this over and over and over again on the margin yes, there's always opportunities. But for the most part we got to fly it when we have to fly it, but the customer can make that decision.",1.05,0.296
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,97,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, there'll be some incremental costs associated with some of the delivery, of course. We've been incurring them, and we will continue to incur them. But that -- now that we've gone to six day, the seven day leap is not nearly as significant. So those won't be material. But they probably will likely be a headwind. But I have to say, what I'm hearing from my team is that the customers are lining up to get to seven day, and we're going to do it very efficiently. And I think we'll be able to start it in a very good way. So, again, I'm excited about what's happening in that regard.",1.0507246,0.854
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,99,Question,2019-06-25,4,2019,David Ross,Stifel Nicolaus,"Yes, good afternoon. Just back on the TNT integration expenses, the total cost of $1.7 billion is about double what it initially was. Can you just remind us what that additional expense is for and is there a difference between network integration, which you said is going to be completed in the next year, and network improvement or upgrades that need to be made to the TNT system?",0.9714444,0.823
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,100,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Hey, David, it's Alan again. Not double. I will tell you a couple of things. One is that we originally gave you a $400 million number about not [indiscernible]. That's an old number that's never been updated. But it continues to be a problem for us in terms of integration as we have to basically rebuild a system that TNT had and then integrate it with the network that we've got on the purple side. And it's cost us a lot more money and slowed it down. And it's made it more complex.",1.0630435,-0.273
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,101,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,The good news on that side is that we -- the interoperability will be done by the end of the fiscal year. And that's when we can start really harvesting the benefits of that low cost road network and flow to Express packages through it seamlessly without all kinds of double handling and double packaging and everything else. I'll let Raj add to this.,0.5152174,0.567
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,102,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, I'll just say that there has been tremendous momentum in the last -- literally in the last few months on the TNT integration. We are -- we have the vision of interoperability by end up fiscal year 2020 with and ultimately one network for air, and one network for ground. It's a lot of value to be had here. But what I want to say here is that we are waiting to create value for the customers because the customer value has been created as we speak, we are speeding up lanes, and our service levels are very good and the demand is strong. So, I think we made a lot of progress and there is significant value in this investment and it'll come to bear fiscal 2021 onwards.",1.5464853,0.976
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,105,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I guess you're asking about the FedEx Office, I think, it plays a very important role as part of our retail network, especially as we move forward on e-commerce, some of the premium value added services on hold a location plus return services are several things that we process to the FedEx Office that's unique and differentiated. And the value is going to get even better as the e-commerce trends increase. I don't know Brie if you want to add anything more to that.",0.6838354,0.908
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,106,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Yes, the only thing that I will add is obviously we're very excited about the expansion of our onsite retail partnerships with Walgreens and with Dollar General. The FedEx Office retail locations bring in some of our most profitable small and medium business because the experience they get when they are shipping internationally when they were shipping and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging. That is absolutely just stellar experience and those employees just deliver a great experience. So we're very committed to that element of the portfolio.",0.1365979,0.959
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,107,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. And don't forget these FedEx office locations, the size of this FedEx offices are substantial and is an excellent place to conduct e-commerce. And as Brie pointed out the most profitable packages for the FedEx system comes to the FedEx office network.",1.7949466,0.859
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,108,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And we're expanding inside Walmart stores, which is becoming a great partnership and Brie, thanks for mentioning profitability I loved it.",0.0188406,0.919
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,111,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Did you ask me the same question in the last analyst call, or somebody else asked me a similar question. But look, the only way I can respond to that is obviously the plans and the programs we put in place were designed to create superior returns. We didn't just decide to do it for the hell of it and it reminds me a little bit about that old adage of Mike Tyson that everybody is got a plan till they get hit in the mouth.",0.754065,0.0
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,112,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So one of the things that always amuses me about watching a lot of things that are written about FedEx and so forth. The competition has a vote and the economy has a vote, so clearly we've been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade, particularly with the Trump administration. The United States policy since 1934 with Roosevelt and the Secretary of State Cordell Hull was to expand international trade.",0.2642276,0.859
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,113,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And now we have a huge dispute where the United States is basically become protectionist defined as I will make everything I need in my own borders. I don't need to import things and quite frankly don't particularly need to export them, despite the fact that 95% of the world's population is outside the United States. So we have become a protectionist country. We don't agree with the Chinese position on trade either and been very vocal about that, which is mercantilist. I would like to sell to you, but I won't buy from you on a reciprocal basis.",0.277439,0.625
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,114,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So your question implies that we have said around and you said quote for decades. We don't look at the business as a single segment, we've said that over and over again, it all be constructed and to some degree I sort of added in that today by making an exception saying we expected Freight and Ground to have earnings increases and margin increases in Freight and hopefully any compression in Ground due to the expansion will be very small.",0.9569783,0.402
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,115,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So clearly as we go forward and things change, if we don't resume any kind of international growth we would change our approach to the business. We don't have any sacred cows here, but you also have to remember in the Express business as Alan said, our domestic Express business is doing fine, it's not the issue, it's the international business that's having a problem for the reasons that Brie and now I am saying to you. Good news is that if traffic and yields materialize, the conversion rate to profitability is probably in the neighborhood of 60%, because it's a network where the incremental volume goes to the bottom line faster than any of our other activity.",0.6598916,0.731
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,116,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"In the case of TNT, I have to say I've been amazed not just with the people who follow FedEx in this industry, with the amazing disinterest and the NotPetya attack. It was the largest single attack by a state-sponsored entity in history of the world. It has put the Ukraine on its knees. The only reason that it was less of a factor to us than it was, was because of the fantastic work of our IT team that went and remediated it, had it not been that TNT had been a subsidiary of FedEx, the company would've been bankrupt. It would have just gone out of business.",0.1554878,0.202
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,117,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So clearly we should of sat and waited, knowing not NotPetya was coming, we could have picked up the pieces. It would've been a lot easier on us. So I think I'm going to ask Rob Carter, our CIO to just give you a bit of color which he was giving me the other day about the NotPetya account to my knowledge, the only in-depth article that's ever been written by that I think was in wired magazine. And when you read that it's like Oh My God this is one of the most underreported stories in history.",0.227981,0.802
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,118,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So to get to your point, of course, we want to make money in these networks and we will engineer and modify them to the extent that we need to, but you got to remember those two things. The anticipation of continued embrace of free trade, which was our assumption on building a lot of the stuff and then not assuming the NotPetya things are the two exogenous factors that we've been dealing with. So Rob you want to comment on this.",0.2178184,0.504
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,122,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Brandon, this is Alan. I just want to -- since the question is an important one, I just feel like I need to weigh in as a CFO. What you just -- the question you asked we talk about all the time, we talk at the board level, we talked about our SMCs, let me just add two things. In fourth quarter a year ago, we were almost there. We had Express running on all cylinders. And that was without TNT providing anything but a drag. So I know we can do it. I know we will do it, I'm disappointed that we haven't done it, but I believe strongly that when we get the interoperability up and we get any kind of global trade environment that's reasonable that we will be successful with our international Express.",1.184058,0.565

FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,125,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, there is a tremendous trade dispute going on between China and the United States as is reported almost hour early on the business TV stations. But we've been a good corporate citizen in China for decades. And we are completely dedicated to compliance in China. And we have expressed that to them and reinforced it. So they audit us in Guangzhou and many other locations. And probably there have been an increase in audits as a result of this to some degree. But we've cooperated fully with the China state postal Bureau and their investigation of the two miss routed packages and the erroneously returned package.",0.0653794,0.844
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,126,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Again, we apologize to the customers, they never left our possessions we offered to make things right, but that has nothing to do with China or Huawei. It has everything to do with the purple promise. We'd have done that for any customer. So our Guangzhou hub is a huge part of the economy of the Pearl River Basin. And so we hope there's not going to be any further deterioration in U.S., China trade relations.",0.679878,0.885
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,127,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me say again, just because it's important for this audience to know about this request that we made of the DC Circuit Court on these export regulations, which really led us to do that at the end of the day wasn't Huawei at all, it was on last Friday, there were five new entities added with these extraordinarily opaque requirements. And contrary what is hear in the media, we don't have to be complicit in this. It's strict liability.",1.423103,0.0

FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,129,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So I don't think that's what they intended. And as Mark said, hopefully we're going to deal with them. But that is separate and distinct from the Huawei situation, which was three packages out of a 15 million package per day. So it's very difficult these days to keep this in perspective. But we've tried to do so and we've got a great team in China, Karen Reddington, our President and Eddy Chan, who runs China for us and our government affairs people. So hopefully we don't have any issues there, certainly hadn't been any operational issues to speak up.",1.0240515,0.834

I don't think that's too much of a strategic question. The AIC that we are forecasting for FY 2020 is in the guidance I gave you.

Let me -- the reason we have now a full portfolio of services on transportation and other e-commerce services is to cater to all the needs of retailers and e-tailers as we go forward here. So to your question, when Walmart talked overnight for Walmart we are the service provider for that and we have a lot of overnight volume for that. If you need extra hours for target we provide that, if we need a local zone one ground delivery we have that service as well.",0.2863622,0.273
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,136,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,So my point here is that we have now a full portfolio of e-commerce delivery services along with technology and returns and more to come as the Chairman talked about it is the most robust in the marketplace. So it's really putting together the whole picture that we are trying to do here.,0.6948494,0.401
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,137,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Hey Ken, Alan. What Ground is working on and doing a great job of is lowering their cost structure dramatically, we wouldn't be taking all the SmartPost packages into our own network if it wasn't the fact that we can do it for a lower cost than the postage. The postage is going to keep going up we're driving our cost down. So, that's an important phenomenon for you to understand. Secondarily again, the customer decides time and distance is how we decide, which network it goes into Ground swung its assets it's double turning, it's doing all kinds of things, but it can't make a really late in the evening pickup for next day delivery or two-day delivery of any kind distance and that's when it goes to Express.",0.2884058,0.787
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,138,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So as Raj was explaining to you. We've got networks to provide whatever the customer wants. And that's important thing, but I don't want today to go by that people understanding Ground is significantly lowering its unit cost and doing it very rapidly.",0.6572464,-0.166
FDX-2019-Q4-2019-06-26,141,Answer,2019-06-25,4,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I got this, of course it's density and as fast as Ground is growing, as fast as the packages are coming to and the fact that we're swinging the assets more and with the technology and engineering expertise that we have, which is world class. We can handle a whole lot more traffic, at a lot lower unit cost and that's a great place to be. All by the way as I want to integrate Ground is faster on 25% net, sometimes we get compared to over the peak season about how well we do versus the competition, everybody forgets, they are holding us to our own standards, not what all the competition does that makes us one, two or three days faster during peak season. So I think we are in great place and that's how we're doing it.",0.8869565,0.896

One, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B and the verticals, particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID, which is on every single box of vaccines that we're now delivering.

So it's not just one side.

FDX-2021-Q3-2021-03-18,171,Answer,2021-03-18,3,2021,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Full disclosure, we are behind both DHL and UPS in this market today, so we see there only upside. When you think about FICP, its features of service are different from our core B2B products in a couple of ways. Number one, we've changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have low-value clearance capabilities, or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile.",1.0191458,0.863

The acceleration of trends experienced in fiscal year 2021 highlight the importance of our ongoing strategic initiatives to win globally in e-commerce.

We are working very closely with customers to leverage the full flexibility of weekend operations, so they can meet the demands of e-commerce every day of the week. This is evident in the growth we saw in Ground Sunday deliveries with 56% more packages delivered on Sunday in Q4 than last year. We are also winning in e-commerce outside the United States by leveraging the strength of our global networks and the expansion of our portfolio. Brie will cover additional details in this regard shortly.",0.0340136,0.959

Our competitive advantage in the marketplace is fueled by a relentless focus on operational excellence and customer service.

Further collaboration to improve efficiency continued across our businesses as we expanded our last-mile optimization program. In addition, FedEx Freight provided approximately 70 million line-haul miles and delivered 1.75 million packages for Ground in fiscal year 2021.",0.3132491,0.542

We are reimagining our digital capabilities and infrastructure in a manner that will deliver market-leading customer experiences that are simple, personal and proactive. We made great strides in fiscal 2021 as we continue to drive new value through strategic technologies, including, increasing capabilities and products through sensor-based technologies like FedEx SenseAware ID and FedEx Surround, which provide unmatched visibility and predictive capabilities, most notably seen during the transportation of life-saving COVID-19 vaccines.

First, we expect to substantially increase capacity for this peek by investing in FedEx Ground's infrastructure, with the addition of 16 new automated facilities and the implementation of nearly 100 expansion projects at existing operations and key technological enhancements. Second, we will complete the air network integration in early calendar year 2022, which will bring the physical TNT network integration to a close and provides the inflection point for long-term profit improvement in Europe. Next, we're exercising existing options to purchase 20 additional 767Fs, 10 for delivery in fiscal year 2024 and 10 for delivery in fiscal year 2025, as we continue to modernize our fleet and improve service to our customers.

Average daily volume grew across all our customer segments, with U.S. small and medium leading the way of 32% year-over-year growth. E-commerce also drove 28% year-over-year growth in our returns business through April. As more consumers shopped online, enrolled FedEx delivery manager users grew by 43% year-over-year.

In the United States, the flourishing U.S. domestic parcel market will continue to provide opportunity in the coming years. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to surpass 107 million packages a day in calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 88% of total U.S. market growth. Excluding Amazon volume, the U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to be 72 million packages a day in calendar year 2022.

In fiscal year 2021 Q4, we increased FedEx Ground economy yields by 28%, and overall, U.S. domestic residential yields by 16% year-over-year. It is important to note when reviewing composite U.S. domestic yields that weights and zone will decrease, putting pressure on yields as we grow in e-commerce.

Global trade volume has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and is on course for its fastest year of growth in over a decade. Global air cargo capacity remained down 10% year-over-year as of April, mainly due to the reduction in passenger value capacity. We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022. Recovery will be slow, potentially episodic, and a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. We believe a favorable pricing internationally should continue through fiscal year 2022.

In fact, we grew e-commerce parcel volume by more than $1 billion year-over-year out of Asia and Europe. To a large extent, due to its lightweight nature and limited relative line-haul capacity requirements, we were able to price e-commerce very competitively.

Consolidated revenue grew 30% year-over-year in the quarter, while adjusted operating income was up 117% even with higher cost to support increased demand, increased variable compensation expense of $380 million and our previously announced $100 million contribution to Yale University to support our carbon neutrality goals.",0.3717383,0.727

And through the incredibly hard work and ingenuity of our team members, we took a significant portion of that revenue growth to the bottom line. Ground revenue grew 27% in the fourth quarter, with operating margin increasing 310 basis points to 13.6%. Ground substantially improved margins and earned the most operating profit in their history. As our international business and e-commerce in the U.S. continued to grow, Express revenue grew 32% over Q4 last year, with adjusted operating margin up 340 basis points. Freight blew out this quarter with 38% revenue growth and their highest quarterly operating margin ever at 16.1%.

We expect margins in all our transportation segments on an adjusted basis to exceed FY21 levels, driven by several key areas. We expect e-commerce to continue to drive higher profitability, and we will continue to invest in our FedEx Ground network to improve efficiency and utilization through expanded and new facilities as well as technology enhancements. We also look forward to incremental benefit from the completion of our physical integration of TNT, which will enable us to offer more and better services to our customers internationally.

Our outlook includes substantial funding of our incentive compensation programs for our team members. That said, variable compensation expense is not expected to be a headwind for fiscal 2022.

This projects to 8% or less of revenue, which is the target level for the CapEx to revenue component of our FY22 to 2024 long-term incentive plan and remains below our historical capital intensity. Approximately half of our expected capital spending this year will be for growth with the remainder for important projects like replacement of our aging FedEx Express aircraft, which not only is expected to have a high financial return, but is an important part of our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint.

But, as we've said, the pandemic accelerated the dramatic and rapid shift in the growth of e-commerce, and at the same time, as you noted there, put some pressure in areas along the way as well, which is really why the performance at Ground in 2021 has been nothing short of stellar.

So, we expect margins to improve in 2022 and beyond as we continue to increase density, further improve the facility and on-road productivity, enhance the utilization of our assets. And I kind of emphasize those aspects as Ground is generating exceptional ROIC margins.

From a structural pricing perspective, we believe that peak surcharges are kind of a new normal and that we have to align our pricing to our costs. I think I've covered that in previous calls that we do anticipate every peak that there will be e-commerce surcharges. As we -- right now, we already have peak surcharges in market, and we continue to evaluate changes that we need to make based on demand and capacity.

We do believe, as I mentioned, that commercial capacity will come back. Episodically, it will not be a straight line up than we actually have, we believe, until 2024. The longer it takes for commercial capacity to come back, quite frankly, the longer we have to make sure that this customer base is sticky.",1.6494845,0.19

So, we don't believe there's any risk there in our small business growth, we've also had internationally. We also believe that volume is very sticky.

So, I don't want to try and parse various elements along the way there. But certainly, the recognition that the first quarter here with the labor challenges and the productivity impacts as well as, keep in mind, we are continuing to still have to make accommodations in the Express air network as well for layover requirements and that.

But when -- to amplify what Raj mentioned earlier, when you don't have the people -- as many people as you would optimally staff the facility with, then, of course, your throughput is lower, and then maybe you're not getting the density within trailers in that that you might otherwise expect. So, then, you're getting incremental cost there, in terms of running the network, the line haul in that. So, it's not as simple as saying, okay, we're X head short, and that's impacting us this way and wage rate is Y percent of it.

You mentioned you adjusted the guidance for the first quarter. I'm curious on your confidence of I think much of the country is hopeful that this labor dynamic ends at the end of the summer. But just curious how conservative you were or maybe a little bit more color about how you're considering it and if you hope to get whole by, say, end of first quarter? And then, the follow-up question but thematically the same is, in Freight, you had some customer suspension, and it looks like that's largely alleviated, but could you put a little bit more color on what occurred and your comfort that that's back in a good situation?",1.1918262,0.947

It's the -- all the aspects we highlighted. It's in the -- obviously, it impacts the first quarter the most. And the general expectations that everyone has is that this will mitigate as we moved into the fall and the markets return to more normalized conditions.

As we look at 2022 and 2023, we absolutely think that you're going to see a greater than our historical average from a year-over-year price increase. As I mentioned this past year, when we look at our domestic volume, we repriced about 45% of our large customer segment. And quite frankly, we actually did most of that in the back half of this year. So, we're going to have some lapping. You're going to get benefits of those new renegotiations in the back half of this fiscal year. We're going to get them in the front half of 2022. In addition, we still have to reprice the rest of the large customer segment. And really importantly, as Fred mentioned, it's not just about the top line yield. It's about really making sure that our price matches our cost. And we're getting very, very focused on that, very disciplined, making sure that customers that have large package, they have the right surcharges, the right structure there, those that have the highest peaking factor really pay for the incremental labor at peak.",0.5964654,0.0

The CapEx growth at Ground is focused on smaller units than kind of going back the historical legacy large hubs. We have one opening, but it's targeted to efficiently and effectively execute on a lot of this growing shorter zone demand. And so, that's why when we talk about having the right targeted investments to align the cost with the -- where demand is going, that's how we're thinking about it.

We have opened some contracts out of cycle when the customer has looked for increased demand. And so, of course, when they want to do something different than what has kind of been our historical average with them, of course, we're going to have those conversations. I think it's really important. Yes, we want to grow our price; yes, we want to grow our yield, but we also want to have really happy, satisfied customers. And so, we're trying to strike that right balance. And so, some customers, yes, they did require changes in their portfolio, a change in mix to meet their business need because many of them saw explosive growth, especially in our retail segment and, of course, in our health care. So, of course, as required, we do reopen account and have those conversations every Thursday morning, as Mike mentioned, Mike and Jill and I get together, and we review what's necessary to run the business.

Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","The Express part of it, like is it starting to normalize somewhat where you're seeing that sort of fall off here? And obviously, inventory to sales ratio might not be as sort of next day just in time based on some of the issues we've had over the past few months.

FDX-2021-Q4-2021-06-24,134,Answer,2021-06-24,4,2021,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Sure, yes. The intensity of demand has not abated, and it's driven by the factors that you and Raj both mentioned. One, on the inventory side, not only is it finished product, but it's raw materials, i.e. chips and other things that are going into finished products. So that remains at historically low levels.",0.0816327,0.548
FDX-2021-Q4-2021-06-24,138,Answer,2021-06-24,4,2021,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Great question. And no, from a European perspective, we're kind of the underdog. We actually see and have had tremendous momentum, as I mentioned, the $1 billion growth from an e-commerce perspective between Europe and Asia, and that's intercontinental. So, when we look at the Europe business, Raj has mentioned, number one, we now have -- we already had, but we even strengthened it further. We have the best coverage across Europe into the United States from a commercial perspective, and the sales team is really excited about that value proposition. So, we have upside potential on both, the B2B and the B2C market share into the United States from Europe.",0.1450663,0.972

We're just getting going on B2C, but we see upward potential there, and we actually also are seeing improving yields in the intra-European theater.

We have seen a tremendous relationship between our Asia and our European teams. Actually, our Asia team has taken share from DHL the last four quarters. So, we're pretty pleased with them.

In some ways, the European markets are the late bloomers, up post COVID-19, but we now expect them to be back to pre-pandemic levels this calendar year versus what we thought will go to be next one. So, there's going to be the demand, especially B2B coming back sooner. And again, I think, we are in a very good position for that.",0.3284742,0.89

First of all, we've already talked about this, but let me re-mention the brick-and-mortar that we're adding. We're adding a very large hub in Chino, California, and we'll end up with 16 regional sortation facilities this year as well as four new automated stations, already been mentioned that we're expanding over 100 of our existing facilities.

I think last year, we called it Shipathon. I think we're looking forward to another Shipathon, quite frankly.

I'll be available on the midyear December call and year-end call next June to answer any questions. The rest of our SMC, we're going to give this time back to them in order to run the railroad because the size and scope of this operation needs every minute that they can devote to their day job rather than to these reports, which will be very adequately handled, as we just demonstrated by Raj and Brie and Mike.

Our FY19 plan envisioned topline revenue growth of approximately $6 billion. Mostly due to lower economic growth in international regions, we expect to end the year with about $4.5 billion in increased revenues. Of course the profit flow through of the $1.5 billion revenue shortfall would of course been substantial in FY19. Nonetheless, the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance is up about $0.20 over FY18. Five-year EPS CAGR using midpoint of adjusted FY19 EPS guidance, I might remind everyone, is expected to be 17% and our target for long-term EPS growth rate is 10% to 15%.",1.7632114,0.9

We're very enthused about the FedEx SameDay Bot, developed with DEKA Research and Development that we unveiled on February 26th.

When you see a FedEx truck on the road, it not only is carrying those local Last Mile shipments, but also the other shipments that are originated from all parts of the globe, creating density for Last Mile delivery and higher revenue per stop. This is an inherent advantage of players who have a global network in place. Any new entrant in this space will not have this benefit and also not have any particular advantage on the input costs.",1.0343375,0.872

We also have a robust loyalty and earned discount pricing strategy for this segment that again rewards customers for bundling their business with FedEx.",0.7823129,0.869
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,37,Remarks,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, in short, we have a terrific portfolio that'll allow us to grow our core business segments and we are very well placed to take share in the rapidly growing e-commerce segments. In the U.S. market alone, we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026. When you view the unprecedented growth opportunity in our industry in the years ahead, and a very small number of providers that will be able to address this opportunity, it becomes clear why we are optimistic about growth over the next few years.",0.2614189,0.97

They include offering leading edge e-commerce solutions, reducing costs and improving revenue quality.

In summary, while significant work remains, I'm confident we are positioned for long-term success. We're making marked progress in our TNT integration, which represents the largest lever for improved express and overall company profitability. In the U.S., our revenue growth and market positions are exceptionally strong. And we are adjusting our revenue management and cost tactics to drive optimal performance.

Higher costs related to staffing and network expansion, and the January launch of year-round six-day per week operations also impacted Ground's performance.

Basically, the perspective of Wall Street is always giving the money; perspective from inside FedEx is what's the best thing we can do for the long term. Now, there have been some exogenous factors that have happened. First, let me remind you that in June, June 27th of 2016, FedEx was in the middle of the largest state sponsored cyber attack in history, so-called NotPetya account that brought the British health care system almost to a halt, cost hundreds of millions of dollars for Maersk, the big sea container line.

We did the job Rob Carter and his people in recovering from that.

FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,77,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Second issue, but as Raj told you, we are very optimistic about our intercontinental network and the ability to improve margins in the Express business, because of the integration. On the Ground side, the issue is very straightforward and that is the market change from more business-to-business to business-to-consumer. So, we could basically have decided not to address that. But as Brie mentioned and Raj both, we decided that we wanted to play in that space and that we were not only playing in it, we were going to be the market leader, and we've gain market share in that sector for 18 consecutive years. So, I think we've got a pretty good track record in that.",1.5067751,0.982
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,78,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we started this fiscal year, very optimistic about our ability to expand margins and to hit on all cylinders. But as I tried to lay out in my remarks, we anticipated a $6 billion revenue increase. We're going to end up with about $4.5 billion. And this is a leverage business and to the extent that the last few percentage of revenue points go to the bottom line at a very disproportionate rate. So, that hopefully answers your question, I mean, we're not on mindful to the issues that you're talking about, but we do think we've got a good runway in the future because we've made those investments.",0.8106369,0.862

The facts of the matter are that we actually are seeing a few green sprouts now as we go into the spring. Part of that may well be the significant weather issues that Raj and Alan both commented upon. And quite frankly, we're under reported I think because of the government shutdown and the trade issues. This was a very, very tough operational winter and in some cases unprecedented, but again somewhat underreported. So, we are seeing some pickup across the Pacific. Our package business in Europe is now growing again. And so, we're feeling a little better about things. And obviously, the range of the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that Alan gave you is related to our caution, I'm not putting too much of that in the bank. Alan may want to talk more about that.",1.1900407,0.804

I tried to describe we had some mix and yield issues at Express and I know the Express is the issue. It's not Ground or Freight. Express returns or what we have to work on the hardest I think we've described for you how we're doing that. But we run pretty tight capacity right now, it's just a different mix than we had expected. So if you look at Express yields in the quarter, they were down year-over-year. And so, the mix had a big impact and one of that is the fact that we are striving to hit the e-commerce demands at the same time as we're reducing our cost structures and we're getting there. We just aren't getting there as fast as we would like to.",0.5351449,0.691
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,83,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"In terms of Ground, what's going on it Ground is nothing short of transformational. Ground is going to be in a position to significantly drive down its costs of serving the residential market and significantly increase its capacity with not much incremental capital expenditure particularly in terms of hubs. It will be investing in terms to be able to handle large packages. We love large packages, keep writing us large packages. We're the best in the business and handling those and we're going to streamline those operations even more. So, I'm not at all worried about Ground's particular margin situation here in Q3 and Q4 because I know where we're headed. So at the end the day, we're running pretty tight on capacity. We're expanding our capacity capabilities at Ground and Freight, and we're very carefully monitoring what we have available out there for FedEx Express.",0.4688406,0.948
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,84,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me just add one other comment here. I'll say perhaps, modestly, there's no organization in the world that knows more about aviation than FedEx, commercial aviation, not one. There's certainly some that are probably peers with us, but we have the finest aviation professionals that operate commercial airplanes. We have a lot of MD-10 airplanes that are 40 years of age. Now, we overhaul them and redid the cockpits and the one thing and another. 11 of those airplanes will be retired in next fiscal year.

It's imprudent to do so and I think there was one suggestion from somebody that we ought to consider that. But that is not a correct decision and our view based on our understanding of the equipment and capabilities. And as Alan has told you on several occasions, these things have great accretive capabilities. They lower our costs and improve our reliability.

But when you look through your U.S. Express results, I think it's fair to say, you saw volume declines and through your form U.S. Express package sub-segments. You also saw yield celebration in your U.S. Express business. So if you could just sort of comment on what you're seeing in the U.S.? I know you're talking about a fairly strong U.S. backdrop, but it seems like we're seeing deceleration there. We'd just be curious what's driving that?",1.2819117,0.854

I think on the U.S. side, our overall volume continues to increase roughly 6%. And I think if you look at what's driving the growth, it is e-commerce. What we are surprised by is the fact that the way for packages and lower than what we anticipate is going to be and that is, that's impacted our yields. So we are doing, first of all, so we're in a position to gain share on e-commerce. We will adjust our cost structure to make sure that we have the right cost to serve. We are very focused on driving overnight volume growth and we are focused on revenue management as well. So there's a lot of activity going on in the U.S. today and I'm quite optimistic that we are going to get this right. And Brie, if we don't add anything to us.",2.8519598,0.971

It is a lighter weight package from e-commerce perspective, which is why we have made the changes in our e-commerce portfolio that FedEx Extra Hours is a great, FedEx Express service that leverages the existing infrastructure. And again, that lower yield is two things, the lower weight and its shorter zones. As we mentioned, we anticipate that the large retailers are going to continue to fulfill locally that's going to put pressure on that top-line yields. But we have the right infrastructure to do so profitably, which is where FedEx Extra Hours and similar products come into play. Those are two issues.",1.7923417,0.861

We are seeing actual -- we're higher year-over-year growth every month from the last 3 months we're seeing accelerating year-over-year increased in revenue and volumes in the European possible business. And as we have stabilized and improving our service levels. So it's not a surprise, you despite the economic headwinds in Europe. We now have a terrific value proposition.

They the programs we have again are not driven because we are profitable in terms of spending capital. It's the nature of the business. We buy an airplane fleet of 700 planes. We've built the business quite frankly. We've used the airplanes and our largest competitor, when they came into the Air Express business was eight times bigger than we were. We're now roughly at parity with them. So we are in the midst of spending a significant amount of capital to replace our very old airplanes and to expand the Memphis in the Indianapolis hubs.",0.4126016,0.796
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,100,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But again, I think as the year turned out the way we had hoped it would at the start of the year and remember it was still in October or November when the Fed was being chastised by the President and others because they were going to raise rates all through calendar year 2019. So you see the Cairns perspective right now so there's no just an act between what Wall Street wants and what FedEx want, it's the matter of whether we would be prudent and stopping doing what we were doing if we think that they will improve our margins and I think",1.5145664,-0.097
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,101,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I even answer previously to the questions you'd have a big setback with not patch you I think we would be even better results in terms of margins of Express at the moment. And secondarily, the Ground market is moved much move to residential delivery and we've moved with it. That's why we went to six day a week operations beginning January the 1st because that's what our ecommerce folks wanted. So, we believe very strongly that we will improve our margins and our returns, as Alan said a few moments ago, and we will get the benefits of the team.",1.2754065,0.869
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,102,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Just want to add that. A lot of the CapEx that we're spending over the next few years is not to crease capacity at Express and it's to replace the 40 year old MD-10 and to drive better throughput, efficiency, productivity and lower costs at our two main hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis, those are big projects. Those have to be done for the long term of this company. And we do manage this business for the long term. Where I sit what I can see future cash flows is pretty impressive.",1.1671526,0.875

We need to a Ground, but we're doing that in a unique way. We are sweating the assets, we're going to run the network more days and we're going to be a lot busier out there. As we lower our costs to serve the residential delivery areas. We had a bad quarter. No doubt about it. I'm disappointed in it. But I'm not letting one bad quarter decide how we're going to manage this business for the next five years.",0.5740201,-0.974
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,104,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"I think that would be imprudent and not in the best interest of our shareholders, quite the contrary we got to redouble our efforts to get those costs down and those areas where we're seeing shorter zones and lighter weight. So that we can be as profitable as we need to be. And that's what we're working on.",0.8117914,0.368
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,105,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Now the way, let me just add in the December meeting, our voluntary buyout we listed 3 reasons for those. First is the multi-year transformation that we've been underway at FedEx called project renewal where we have taken down hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of legacy mainframe systems and move these applications into the cloud. So, we are removing the last mainframe installations in the next year or so. And there are people whose skill sets, don't fit or they're in the wrong location.",1.3505021,-0.153
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,106,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we're offering them a great opportunity, but we didn't want to stop renewal, because that's where technology is taking this. Second is Alan mentioned in his remarks? One of the things that we have, which is extremely important are very, very sophisticated analytics on the pick-up and particularly on the delivery side. So what you basically do is you substitute information for math, and we're not the only ones doing this. UPS talks about it. But this is going to be a profound transformation in the next few years.",0.8862974,0.888
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,107,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So the use of AI and then robotics is also making folks that have been in staff positions. We don't require the same level of manning. And then finally, as has been mentioned, on a couple of occasions here, there will be people leaving on a volunteer basis from the legacy TNT system as the integration complete. These weren't layoffs and they certainly weren't because we were propagated or not watching our waistline, they were from those 3 reasons. And we think culture and service orientation is the most important thing in FedEx.",0.1574344,0.541
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,108,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So we're not going to pre-people roughly and lay off about a bunch of folks. We're doing it in a way that that's consistent with our values and with the type of service in FedEx is known for. So I think it's important to reiterate what I said in December about those voluntary buyouts, because that was completely missed by a lot of people. In fact, right after their earnings calls some of the major media was talking about layoffs and FedEx and layoffs at all their voluntary buyouts driven by those 3 issues.",0.2014901,0.312

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Ben, I would say that, what we have found is that, what we've been talking you mostly about where the operational integration costs of putting these networks together. Again, as Raj talked to I mean, we're starting to get there and we're going to pick up a lot of momentum in FY 20. What we're seeing, however, is that as we -- as Raj and team continues to bring those antiquated systems up to current standards and beyond that we probably have some back office and other areas where we can do further investment. And so, we'll keep you updated on that. But far as operationally, we tend to be -- we think we're going to be there by the end of FY '20, and that's the biggest part. So, don't be scared about a lot of additional integration money. There won't be a lot additional [technical difficulty].",1.8326087,-0.488

FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,115,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Hey, David, I think just to put it put it in perspective here. The inventory to sales ratio in the U.S. ran up in Q4 of calendar year '18. And so, we knew that the slowdown coming in Q1, it was just -- it was the pre-Chinese New Year. The peak was very muted, and the post-Chinese New Year was very, very soft.",1.414642,0.0

I'm going to sit here and project that's going to have -- what's going to happen for the rest of the quarter four, I cannot do that at this point. There's still uncertainty in the market. But, if the trend continues then of course it'll be good news.",0.8049887,0.527
FDX-2019-Q3-2019-03-19,117,Answer,2019-03-19,3,2019,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Let me add. I think there's been well reported in the trades. But prior to January the 1st, there was a significant amount of traffic that was put on the water beginning in late summer and in the fall, based on the deadline of January the 1st for the imposition of new tariffs. Now, the President decided to delay those, but there was a lot of inventory that was moved into the U.S. And you sort of saw the opposite side of that from China into Europe where they didn't have the tariffs. So, it was quite a different profile. So some of the follow activity during the first quarter, I think was a reflection of that inventory to sales ratio that Raj just mentioned to you. So hopefully now with the anticipation of a trade deal or at least a more can lead your conversation going on about it and in terms of tariffs, maybe we'll go back into a more normal cycle.",0.2520325,0.669

So, I'm just going to tell you that it's going to be transformational. I'm highly confident about where we're headed. I've got a very good feeling about what our costs are going to be and how much volume we're going to be able to run to the ground network. As to the current trends, we did have a 3% yield increase in Ground. Frankly, we thought, we were going to a higher.",0.6385501,0.939

Cost structure will get there and we're not -- I'm not worried about Grounds margins in the longer term. Although, I did tell you that I don't think they're going to pop back up in Q4 like we sometimes see because we have a lot of investment going on for these transformational things that we have underway.

Our largest customers have grown really fast at Ground, and of course they have the -- they enjoyed the best pricing. We are attacking as Brie and Raj told you the small and medium enterprises. We don't have our fair share yet at Grand in that area. We will. And then as I said, we're working really hard on our cost structure for residential and short-haul deliveries.

First of all, I think it's important to look at the things that we've said over the last few earnings call in the context of about what's going on globally.

And I remember when we made this call on CNBC, they took our heads off that we were, ""blaming someone."" We're just reporting what's going on and reacting to these macroeconomic things. And as Alan said, that's why it makes us so hard to forecast. We think we've taken appropriate steps. We'll do more if we have to, but I can't give any better answer than what I just did.",0.4288618,0.322
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,95,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I think you're a great person to ask that Brandon because you're so called the deep dive, so let's talk about LTL. I don't think we have John Smith here to here today. First of all, there are other carriers that do better than FedEx with the exclusion of perhaps a little smaller carriers and ones sort of I'm not familiar with, I believe the better way to put that is there's one LTL carrier that does better than we do. And that's Old Dominion, and we're great admirers of Old Dominion.",1.170393,0.961
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,96,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"But Old Dominion operates a network that has I believe somewhere in the 200 and some odd stations, versus our 360. They don't deliver every day to every part of the United States. And they've been very brilliant in finding a niche that's for lack of a better term near TL. It's in that zone between LTL and TL and their average weight per shipment in much more dense network is about 350-400 pounds higher.",0.7930217,0.735
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,97,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So their margins are outstanding, and they have terrific and obviously, we benchmark them carefully as our other competitors, which gets to you your point, do we ever think about doing things differently? And the answer to that question is we think about doing things differently constantly.",0.7008808,0.823
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,98,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Secondly, in the Express business, there is a belief, including you, Brandon, that somehow our Express operation in the United States is not profitable. Our Express operation in United States is very profitable. And we have some of the best industrial engineers and operations research people in the country.",0.9292005,0.717
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,99,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So there has been this constant mantra for 10 years that we ought to put Express and Ground together. Well, my goodness, we've gained market share in Ground for 19 out of 20 years. And Brie and Raj just told you we think it's going to continue and our competitive advantage is going to improve. So we're very convinced that the way that we are operating is the preferred way. And yes, we look at it at it every day.",0.7455962,0.961
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,100,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The third thing that gets people fired up. And I guess, Scott Group just mentioned it about CapEx is we are profligate in terms of CapEx. The reality is about $0.60 out of every dollar we're spending on CapEx are to modernize the Express hubs, to put in this new technology, we can't get people in Indianapolis and Memphis to work it. They're not out there plus it improves the productivity. So the failure to do it would be very dire.",0.4227642,-0.826
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,101,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And as Alan has said, and we've said over and over again, every time we bring on a 767 and to a much lesser degree, the 777 because we're not buying many other of them. It's accretive to earnings, the reliability goes up. So could we stop buying 767, and 777s? Yes, why don't we stop buying them, because we put a chart on the earnings -- the IR website today that showed the synergy between the three major OpCos. So 80% of our customers buy all three of the services.",0.8953252,-0.302
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,102,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, if you took FedEx and tried to subject it, let's say to I think it was BCG that came up to that diagram, you have dogs and cash flows and one thing or another. If you did not improve the Express company, unless your costs get out of control, you couldn't win in the Ground sector and vice versa.",0.598916,0.339
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,103,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, we are very convinced and we put up a chart that specifically addressed your comments about this, FedEx will unquestionably be the low cost producer in the domestic Express business because of the fleet modernization and that includes any new entrance into the business.",0.495935,0.225
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,104,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, we have higher pilot costs and AMT costs perhaps, than the third-party providers. We think that's a good thing. But our total productivity and our cost per tonne mile are down 2% over the past 10 years, in this year's dollars. I'm not talking about inflated dollars, I'm talking about 2019 dollars are 2% less than 2009 dollars.",0.5210027,0.681
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,105,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the fleet modernization, yes, we could stop it and yes, we could stop that CapEx, but the competitive positioning against our major competitors.",0.425813,0.372
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,106,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the last thing I'm going to say is, we basically compete in an ecosphere that's got five entities in it. There's UPS, there's DHL, there's a US Postal Service, and now increasingly, there is Amazon. That's who we wake up every day, trying to think about how we compete against and give the best services to our sales force.",0.3794038,0.71
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,107,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, it reminds me of my days in the service where you run all these fake manoeuvres one thing another, it's a lot different when you got competition on the other side. So we try to beat these folks, UPS, and in particular has a very strong retail presence and both UPS and DHL have significant forwarding presences. So we've decided that we would basically cover those portfolio gaps with more focused capabilities, and that's why we operate differently.",0.3187669,0.419

And we have a retail network that is smaller than UPS store franchise network, but utilizes partners as Brie talked to you about Walgreens, and dollar -- more recently Dollar General and some others.",1.2002033,0.166
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,109,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the reason I'm going on about this, I'm not quite sure how this mantra got started, that we're hard hitted, or we're not willing to look, we'll look at anything. But what we can't do is to change the reality of the math. We can't make the competition go away, I wish they would, just leave the field, they're very good operators.",0.8414634,0.479
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,110,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And the third thing that we have to deal with is the macroeconomic environment. And by the way, there's no company and no person that has been more vocal in our opposition to the trade policies that we are pursuing. Now, to be fair, I think it's not just the U.S., I think China is also pursuing bad trade policy. So you're taking a system over the last seven years that's drawn more people out of poverty than in the entire previous history of the world, and essentially putting it all at risk.",0.8672087,-0.9
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,111,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So these numbers on these macroeconomic production indicators, we didn't make those up. That's what's going on. So I apologize for the length of the response. But it's to this continuing drumbeat that somehow we're not willing to look at something and you take selective things like your LTL operation in as good as, all the others, it's not as good as one and it's not as good as the other ones in terms of margins for the reasons that I gave you. So it's important to look at this thing with those contexts in mind.",0.8387534,0.918

And I think we told you early on in the intro, Allison, as at least it goes to zone one where we think we're going to grow really rapidly. We're talking about lower yields and higher margins. So I think Ground performing admittedly. The issue at Ground is there's just not the commercial traffic we'd plan to have, which has significantly higher density than home delivery does. Home delivery is growing like crazy and the commercial businesses not because of industrial production, and all the other things we said.",1.1068841,0.44
FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,116,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,So that's a fairly simple explanation. We're adjusting the model accordingly to do that. I think Ground's in great shape. I think it's doing fantastic. And I don't see anybody making better margins than us.,1.3264493,0.891

FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,120,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So all of these moves that we announced were triggered by a series of developments. And the strategy has been in production for a long time. So we're very confident about where this market is going that Brie described to you and we're very confident in Ground's position.

FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,122,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"Well, let me just add on to that by just saying that there's a strong divergence between the strong consumer sector and the weak factory sector around the world and U.S. as being no exception. That the industrial production in U.S. is expected to be flat to negative in the second half of CY 2019 that's the issue and once we get the commercial traffic -- that's the issue. Ground is doing very, very well. And we are definitely investing for the future and we are going to have the market leading value proposition, best service at low cost.

FDX-2020-Q1-2019-09-17,125,Answer,2019-09-17,1,2020,Henry Maier,,"Finally, we've talked about the robust labor environment out there. There are geographic markets, where it's highly competitive to get package handlers into the building. And while our automated network benefits us greatly in that regard for employees, where we're competing for the same unskilled labor in the market we have to be cost competitive.

I mean, we said we're going to be really well positioned by the end of 2021. Yes, we were late and over budget on the TNT integration, but we're there we're will be there.

And we'll be ready to move forward. So given a decent economic environment, we ought to be able to easily hit our 10% to 15% earnings EPS growth going forward.

Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2% due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance costs. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates. Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year.

First of all, I'm not sure this is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets for express freight and packages and packets. And we are the market leader in the United States with our express freight. There are three services; overnight, two day and then two to three day and that is a very profitable service, and we have different pickup and delivery vehicles optimized for express freight.

So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals which have pallet sortation facilities in one end, package sortation in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries.",0.798103,0.422

And of course Europe is a high density of population and their ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. We have a very extensive express freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world.

In our Memphis hub, there's a whole freight area that you've seen. It's around the world; the same Dubai, the same Hong Kong, the same Brazil and around the world. One of the big advantages of TNT, and Fred's right that goes unnoticed, is their ability to handle very profitable freight and that's a part of their business that now we're going to put into our global network of parcels and pallets and it's been very successful for us.

A lot of companies are starting to experiment with UAVs, FedEx experimenting as well.

So when we get there, we can give you some more detail about that. As to our purchase price accounting, you'll see in our 10-Q that there was about - the purchase price is $4.9 billion. There was about 3 billion of goodwill in that which we will not be amortizing and hopefully we will never amortize it as we will seek to make sure that we will earn plenty of money to justify the carrying cost of that goodwill. The intangible assets, the biggest one's the customer relationship that we're looking at right now. We've got that on the books for 685 million in a 15-year use for life.

And the fact of the matter is we believe our stock's undervalued. But we're also investing in the company's future at the same time. I think we get criticized a lot about our capital expenditures but they all carry very solid long-term return on invested capital or we wouldn't be doing them. And then lastly, although we got a lot of debt, I should tell you that the average coupon on that's 3.6%. So every project that we're doing is going to be earning way more than that on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are good. We've committed to improving our credit metrics but we'll continue to buy back stock, raise dividends and invest in our businesses going forward because we can and we're going to manage it accordingly.",1.0652174,0.965
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,100,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about it.",0.1019648,0.572
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,103,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,Okay. We'll take two questions from the call.,2.6981707,0.226
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,105,Question,2016-09-20,1,2017,Jack Atkins,Stephens,"Good evening. Thank you for the time. Just going back, Alan, to your comments on the synergies for a moment, are the synergies - just to be clear, are the synergies in addition to the expectations for margin improvement from the outlook program that TNT was already undertaking? And then also could you quantify the EPS accretion from TNT that is embedded in the adjusted FY '17 guidance? Thank you.",0.6621295,0.916
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,106,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I'm not going to go there on number two. That would be again trying to break us down by segments in EPS delivery. As to number one, we bought TNT for a reason. We didn't own them last fiscal year except for a couple of days. So when we get out to 2020 what I'm saying is we'll be 750 million of synergies better off than we would have been without them. So you'll be able to very easily measure that and follow that along. And as I said, we'll talk about this more after we've completed our validation of our strategic business case and met with our Board of Directors about where we stand on that, which is going to take us a little bit of time to get to, as we are also right in the middle of the throes of actually integrating as I mentioned to you in my opening remarks. So just have a little patience but the whole point was to tell you, this thing is a homerun, it's going to be a homerun and we're going to have that done by four years from now and we will continue to update you along the way. It's going to be a great ride.",1.5333333,0.867
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,111,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"This is Alan. I'm going to give you a little bit color on where Henry is right at the moment. We have invested and our investing significantly this fiscal year in Ground to get to the next level where we need to get. And it's a big capital step I would tell you. So it's $2 billion of this year, maybe the same even next year. And that of course has a cumulative effect. When you turn on these new facilities they're not full day one. You got to work them through the systems and they have a little bit of a drag. That drag is fine to me because I know what the long-term results are going to be. I know the growth that everyone is going to have. Originally, we did get a little surprised by how quickly these non-conveyables and oversized things grew. We're going to lean right into that. We're going to be the best in the business in getting those delivered. We're going to get them priced right. They got to be handled a little bit differently. So that also has a start-up cost associated with it. So I gave you guidance for the full company for the year and Henry's comparisons are going to be a little bit more difficult because of all those investments that we're making. But the state of the business is as good as it's always been and I can't wait until we turn the corner from this period of heavy capital investment.",2.5242754,0.808

FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,114,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Okay. Here's one from - Matthew Troy sent one from Wells Fargo Securities about the dimensional pricing and calculation. I think Mike has answered that as to what drove it and why we did it, to standardize it across the enterprise and basically the realities of the increased costs in handling it.",0.5684282,0.735

FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,119,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I've been really pleased with how well our spending has followed what we had designed in integration plan. We knew that IT was going to be a big one and that's the long pole in the tent, but we've got really good people working on this. And you've heard we're already starting to integrate, that's a little bit ahead of what I thought we would be able to do. So when I say 700, 800, that's kind of what we thought about all along. And as I said there will be some restructuring charges along the way. We bought Flying Tigers and we bought Ground, there wasn't 'the integrations' so much to say as there is in this one. So this is going to be a little bit different for us but we're well ahead of the game, so I'm very comfortable with how that's going and stay tuned and bear with us and we'll keep you updated and apprised. But it's going to be a homerun.",0.915942,0.922

I've been in Europe a lot of times now and meeting with the whole team over there now, the TNT people that have joined FedEx and I got to say and Fred said it now, the people are fantastic. Service is second to none on the ground. They're the best in Europe coupled with the best air express system in Europe. We have this opportunity to make this not only what Alan said a homerun, this is a grand slam. It has gone exceptionally well because their people and our people have matched culturally and at the end of the day that's the main thing.",0.8448276,0.959
FDX-2017-Q1-2016-09-20,121,Answer,2016-09-20,1,2017,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Back to the second one, Ken, on tax, you tell me. Are we going to get tax reform or not? The United States is shooting itself in the foot by continuing to not do territorial and have the highest tax rate in the world. What I'm saying is based on today's laws, we're going to earn a whole lot more in lower tax places than we do today and over time that's going to drive our rate now. We also are in the process of restructuring our tax structure and I think we're going to be much more efficient in terms of paying taxes where we actually earn the money than we've been able to do as a U.S. certificated air carrier over the years. So both of those should work in our favor and neither one of those benefits are in the 750. 750 is above the line.",0.009058,0.828

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The only thing that's not cash, Ravi, are the amortization of the intangible assets. Everything else is cash and I've given you all those numbers in my presentation and they'll be restated in the 10-Q. And I've only given 17 at this point. The total 700 million to 800 million is integration costs by itself and does not include any intangible assets, so that might help you a bit. I'll let somebody else handle Hanjin.",0.2278986,0.715

The international priority box is up 3%, the international economy is up as well. So in many of the segments that we are really leading the world, the volume is there and it's growing. On top of that, the yields are increasing. So I would say and Mike might want to add to this, on the international front we're right in the mainstream of where the main business is growing.

Operating income increased slightly year-over-year to 1.11 billion, with higher base rates of each of our transportation segments, increase volumes in Ground and Freight and a favorable net impact from fuel. These improved results were impacted by the timing of significantly higher variable compensation accruals which were up 140 million in third-quarter.

All this guidance assumes no material impacts from future TCJA guidance or interpretation. Our adjusted FY effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%.

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Same at Freight, going forward, I don't think we are going to be needing to add as many doors for shipment as we have done in the past because of the great engineering work that's going on there, and lot of these we will talk about later on in the next several months as we go forward, but as I said, I would talk about FY '19 in June. I would just say this I don't think it's going to be much different at all than '18 is going to be. And as I said 20 might have a pick-up because of aircraft delivery. So from a cash flow standpoint, I think we are in fantastic condition.",0.5945652,0.815
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,95,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Tom added another question here, which I think we need to answer. Incentive compensation likely to be a significant year-over-year headwind to EPS and FY for fourth quarter FY '18 somewhere magnitude to the headwind and in third quarter, Tom, I think that nature of the question indicates a bit of a misunderstanding about this. AICs now will be a headwind in the fourth quarter because and the weather will just stop the four quarters are gangbusters and because of all the noise that's why, we gave you this onetime special deal of showing you what the anticipated segment margins are going to be in the fourth quarter.",0.3072493,0.25
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,96,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So what happened here is when tax reform took place and we felt that was appropriate to do all of the things that we have described to you. What that required us to do is to pick up AIC which had been reduced because of NotPetya, and then it was put back in the third quarter for the Company as a whole and off course especially effected the FedEx Express rate. So on a go forward basis it's baked in and the fourth quarter you can do the math with the range for the year that Alan gave you it's going to be in the numbers and the quarter should be quite good year-over-year for all of the segments.",0.3766938,0.493
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,97,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Again, I will give the caveat because if we are in the midst of some sort of weather system where the northeast or it's going to July, that's a different matter, but we're fairly confident that they will be at the end of that. Now, there is question from Jeff Kaufman of Tahoe ventures about electric vehicles for commercial trucks and the OEM following suit. What's FedEx view on the emerging green technologies and where is the Company in terms of adoption and commitment to green technologies? Does FedEx believe these technologies are ready to meet company's needs?",0.0060976,0.907

FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,101,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So here is a couple of related questions, I'm willing to pass on to Dave Bronczek and David Cunningham, I'll give you overarching comments first, from Todd Fowler of KeyBanc. Please discuss what drove the decline in international and U.S domestic volumes within Express segment in the quarter? How important is volume growth in achieving FY 2020 profit improvement plan?",0.328252,0.899
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,102,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"The second is from Jack Atkins of Stevens. To what degree was the June cyber attack at TNT negatively impact 3Q results? I guess it did negatively impact 3Q results at Express and would you expecting the lingering impact in the fourth quarter. Now, I think the question from Todd and Jack and I'm going to ask again Dave and David Cunningham to amplify this, reflects a bit of a misunderstanding here and that please recall that when we started this year, we told you that we were no longer going to be talking about Express and TNT.",1.0271003,-0.7
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,103,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So the numbers that are in the Express segment now are the combination of the two. So the reality is the FedEx Express volumes are growing, but the TNT volumes were adversely affected by NotPetya, and we are now going back up to two to where we would have been had this attack not happening. And let me again give enormous thanks to our sales, our customer service, and particularly our IT professionals that did the most unbelievable job of recovering from this attack which the which the U.S. government now says was a government or government sanctioned attack on the Ukraine and TNT was just a side victim of it.",0.1409214,-0.941
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,104,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, the fourth quarter will I think began to show these in a more granular fashioned, but it's we're not seeing a decline in Express traffic in the fourth quarter. We will have recovered most of the NotPetya volume from TNT now. Put some meat on the turkey.",0.1686992,0.0

The reason that actually we went through all of these detail we did in the fourth quarter along with all the reasons that Alan talked about in the tax reform still is to give you an idea of where the fourth quarter is forecasted to be which is significantly different and better than the Q3 numbers. In my comments I said that they could run up to potentially 10.4% operating profit margin at Express that's actually very strong revenue across all other Express so reasonably put in Q3 and put in the six items that effected Q3 by falling away was the variable comp and so on it was because of the reason that you just suggested that we talk about Q4 and its very strong in Q4.

I believe you are talking about the differed in Express and really our volumes are impacted by the way we managed one large customer whose volume was at forecasted levels look at the base volume grows underlying basis especially in the small and medium customer segments we saw a very robust growth and by the way don't forget the strong growth we saw in the ground segment which also carries e-commerce traffic.",0.2121801,0.907

FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,113,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Here is one again about Express 3Q and 4Q. I hope I explained that six items with a big part of it was variable compensation when we decided to positive tax act, as Alan described to you, increase wages for hourly teammates and we had the benefit of the tax bill and so obviously we're not going to penalize our participants in our AIC program, which are thousands of our frontline managers. It required a refunding if you will of the AIC in the third quarter. So the fourth quarter it's essentially normalized. Ravi Shanker what was the strategic rationale for putting FedEx office locations or FedEx Walmart locations whether strategic rationale Ravi is because they will make us more money, but the broader point you may want to serve for customer pickup and drop-off are also served as Omni-channel service points.

As I mentioned earlier this is an opportunity to serve our consumers who want, we're seeking secure reliable options for packing shipping and receiving packages.",0.5600907,0.91
FDX-2018-Q3-2018-03-20,115,Answer,2018-03-20,3,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So Scott Schneeberger would ask a similar issue about the financial impact of adding FedEx office 500 Walmart stores. I think that obviously as a bow wave of small proportion when you open these things. But remember we said in our press release. If you read it, we tested these at 47 locations. We have a rapid paybacks. So this is going to be inconsequential on the expense side in the near term and I think quite a important channel for us in our retail and customer convenience channel in the next several years. After the opening expenses are in essence covered, but they're not significant in the scheme of the Company the size. And we got three questions from Brian Ossenbeck, Matthew Troy and Allison Landry about DHL's launch of their new service.

We don't comment on specific competitive strategies, but there are multiple new test in pilots were companies are considering variations of crowd sourcing or other options for last mile delivery.

There are so many things that go on around the world. I quit giving quarterly ranges because I can never hit him.

FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,183,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And Scott, let me give you one example here of just what we're talking about. I happened to be in New York last Monday given a talk for Fortune Magazine. A snowstorm hit, which I unfortunate was out in. I don't know what that snowstorm cost FedEx with the size and scope of our operations, but it certainly cost us a significant amount of money at Ground, Freight and Express.",0.677168,0.511
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,184,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, whatever it is, that's why we have a range because stuff happens. Now if volumes are a bit stronger than we think in the fourth quarter, they won't make any difference. We'll be at the top end of the range. If volumes aren't quite as strong then that snowstorm may push us within the range to some other place.",0.5934959,0.789
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,185,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, it's very difficult for us to be any more specific and I think as I mentioned a moment ago, for a company of this size, $60 million for the CFO a year ago June, to tell you that we were going to have a range and we now reconfirm 10 months later even I am in all of that.",0.4444444,-0.469

FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,193,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"So, let me give you a couple updates there. First of all the company that was formally known as GENCO was rebranded to FedEx supply chain in the quarter and we launched FedEx Fulfilment which I think you need to look at as an all-in-one logistics solution for e-commerce companies, but primarily targeted at small and medium-sized e-commerce companies, some of which are startups.",0.4049587,0.226
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,194,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"Let me just put little bit of color around this. You really need to have somewhere between 50 and 2,000 shipments a day to fit into this and the reason why that range is necessary is because in order for this to work, you got to have the ability to keep your inventory in at least one of potentially two of these warehouses that are run by FedEx supply chain.",1.6213373,0.586
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,195,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"The reason why that's important is, is that we've cited those fulfillment centers in such a way as we can reach 94% of the population out of two of the -- out of two of them in two days or less and I will let you this should be obvious to you why that's a big deal.",0.8031555,0.226
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,196,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"The pitch is simply this, FedEx Fulfilment is a one-stop shop for warehousing, fulfillment order management, inventory and transportation management, and reverse logistics, which allows these small to medium sized customers to really focus on their business, which is selling things online.",0.4977461,0.0
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,197,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"It is not a marketplace. However, since these folks may be selling on their own market, on their own website, it gives them the ability for us to have -- for them to have visibility to their inventory as they could potentially sell across some of the 90 or so marketplaces that exist out there.",0.0244177,0.318
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,198,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"Its highly customizable in the sense that you can -- we will actually ship your product in your own branded carton, which is really important because there are now companies that don't allow you to sell or sorry, to fulfill for certain fulfillment operations if it's going to show up in that company's branded box.",0.729151,0.771
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,199,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,"They also do gift wrapping as part of this. So, something that's really important for some of these smaller facilities. It's also integrated with FedEx cross-border, which gives them the ability to sell internationally, which is a big deal for these small customers because generally the first thing they find out is once they get online and get the product on one of these marketplaces, orders come in from parts of the world they didn't expect.",0.7054846,0.743
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,200,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Henry Maier,,I will tell you that we're really grateful for the customer interest we've had in this today because it's far surpassed any of our expectations. Hope that answers your question.,0.6870774,0.848
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,201,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Again, let me stress what Henry just said here to make sure the plane is there. This lets the merchant sell on any marketplace. So, if they want to sell on Amazon, that's great. If they want to sell on Walmart, it is very aggressive trying to attract marketplace customers that they want to sell on eBay if they want to sell on Ali Baba, JD.com, as Henry said, there are 90 of these marketplaces.",0.7103659,0.847
FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,202,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Now obviously, Amazon in this country is the biggest.

FDX-2017-Q3-2017-03-21,213,Answer,2017-03-21,3,2017,David J. Bronczek,"President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So, I think that you're going to see us become a little bit more aggressive as I mentioned before in filling up our 777s coming out of Liège and the operations in Europe. I think there's going to be more synergies between the volumes, between TNT of the past and FedEx in Europe, including helping our yields and including helping our product profitability, but also fundamentally growing our volume and growing our revenue.

That's all it was. And the reason we're doing it is with a few reasons. One is of course density. Matching stops and adjacency drives significant stop efficiencies for us. And then second is our enhanced technology. With our Dynamic Route Optimization, it maximizes productivity opportunities in route planning.

In this particular case, as we talked about the flight hours earlier, our planned flight schedule is to be down 7.5%. However, we are tactically deploying excess sections as we see the opportunity to move like additional profitable business in this capacity constrained environment. So, that's again, we are a key player in connecting the global commerce, and this fact becomes ever more evident in this current circumstances, especially out of China right now.",0.0495627,0.898
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,107,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I've been through a few of these in my four year career at FedEx and I think we've always rebounded very well from and always managed them very well. Obviously, you're talking about like one of our scenarios, it's way down on the realm of likelihood and possibility as of today, but we still have to have it. So it's all the normal levers that you would imagine it would be.",2.0246377,0.484
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,108,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"But, as probably from my point of view, a company that's best positioned to continue to keep global supply chains up as we fight this virus and then rebound from it, I think we're in great shape in that regard. So it just depends on how long it lasts and how much demand there is. But there is going to be demand. People are going to be needing medical supplies; people are going to be needing to eat; people that can run businesses are going to run businesses, and they're going to rely on us to help them with their supply chains, and we're confident in that.",0.5304348,0.891
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,111,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, I've talked about the cost part, and I'll turn it over to Brie to talk about the dilution part. Every time we have a match or a near match of the SmartPost package in our Ground network, our costs are significantly below the postage for SmartPost. So it's just math. And the more of those we get out there, the more productive then our independent service providers can be with everything else that they're delivering. So it has a wonderful effect on the productivity and the cost per package across the entire network. And it's working extremely well. I'll let Brie talk about the marketing part.",1.8434783,0.816
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,112,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Sure. As I mentioned before, there is a couple of different nuances from a features or service perspective, but they are important. The first from a home delivery perspective, it is a guaranteed product. The SmartPost product is not a guaranteed product. So if you need that peace of mind you're going to pay for it. And we continue - as I mentioned earlier, we have studied this with a lot of rigor and a lot of in-depth analysis our two distinct markets there.",2.4620766,0.791

Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","In addition to that, we have a variety of different features of service on the Home Delivery product. There are different features of service from a consumer perspective. We call them consumer delivery options that are available on the Home Delivery product. They're not available on the economy product. And as I mentioned earlier, we do believe that a portion of the product, the sub-pound, will continue to be delivered by the post office. We've studied this. We think this is the right portfolio, and we're very confident in that decision.",0.5736377,0.541
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,115,Question,2020-03-17,3,2020,Jack Atkins,Stephens,"Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of business trends among your core B2B customers? It certainly sounds like B2C traffic has been strong over the last couple of weeks. But what's happening with that core B2B base? Have you seen a change there over the last two to three weeks, given the virus impact? And as you think about your leverage to small and mid-sized businesses, how do you think those particular customers are going to trend as we look out over the next few weeks?",0.3021779,0.847

Let me talk about our B2B base because it does vary around the world. Here in the United States, as Raj mentioned, from a commercial business, we see that currently to date, it is quite stable. From an Asia perspective, we're actually quite optimistic. From a stock replenishment perspective, we have seen throughout the month of March really day-over-day, week-over-week improvements from a volume, and the vast majority of what we have coming out of Asia, the vast majority actually is commercial traffic.",0.8980118,0.946
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,117,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Brie A. Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","What we talked about this morning actually when we looked at the Chinese recovery, what we have seen is 90% to 95% of large manufacturers in China are now back to work in some capacity. Closer to 65% to 70% of small businesses in Mainland China are coming back to work from a manufacturing perspective. So we believe output is in around 65% to 75% and we are seeing that rebound. So from an Asia perspective, we feel really good, large customer leading, small customer coming back from a China perspective.",0.4204713,0.493

Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","Europe, right now we can't predict because it has had the most change, I would say in the last 24 to 48 hours. You've all seen the media. We do anticipate by the end of the week to be incremental manufacturing closures in Europe. So we are anticipating more softness there in Europe, but the US is strong and Asia is in really good shape as we speak today.",0.2488954,0.867

It's very sad but congratulations and best wishes on your retirement. My question is really for Fred. There was a lot of change in the world in 2019 that affected you guys with the trade wars and so on. Could you just talk about how you think this whole coronavirus will change the way the world does business, if at all? Thank you.",0.7349774,0.879

I have told him, we were just getting started here, but I think he's got his priorities right with Susan and his family. But he is still the CFO till September the 21st at midnight. And then I'll have a lot more to say about Alan on the next couple of calls.",0.5128726,0.141
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,122,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So, Helane, I think one of the things that we've been in the midst of and it's been a bit of a disappointment to the SMC and me in particular that we haven't gotten across to people how fundamentally changed the world was before the coronavirus.",0.4705285,-0.511
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,123,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"I mean we were the first people in the fall of 2018, in fact, it was on one of these analyst calls that basically we said Europe is essentially moving into a business recession because when the trade war began in March of 2018 when the President famously said trade wars are good and easy to win, people missed the point that it wasn't just China that was in the sights, it was Europe. And it was a ricochet bullet that hit Germany.",0.2388211,-0.44
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,124,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So by the fall of 2018 we began to see that. And if you look at the PMIs from that point forward, really until the last couple of months of 2019, they look like a ski slope and then they flattened out. So we've done a wonderful job, I think, of trying to deal with that. We were hopeful that it was going to be a China deal on the trade side in the spring of 2019 and in fact we were told that was the case. It didn't happen.",0.4600271,0.868
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,125,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"We would probably done some different things have we not been a bit more optimistic then back. So fundamentally the major change that's gone on, and FedEx had been talking about it for a long time, is the reduction in world trade and the rising of protectionism and mercantilism and a lot of tariff and non-tariff barriers.",0.6415989,0.38
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,126,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So you had the coronavirus on top of that and world GDP growth this year is going to be extremely small. And I know we've suspended our economic outlook. So I think that's - number one is, you're going to see probably less international trade because of those political trends. Maybe it will turn around, but there is nothing that seems to be a catalyst at the moment that says that.",0.6056911,0.111
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,127,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Second, I suspect this will be somewhat more short term than long term because people forget that there was a tremendous flu epidemic I think it was in 2009 and a lot of people thought that things would change permanently as a result of that. They didn't. Now the coronavirus, maybe a little bit different because it's so virulent obviously in terms of the contagion. It doesn't seem to be as dangerous to most people, but the lethality for older people with underlying diseases is quite stark.",0.2310298,-0.83
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,128,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if I had to speculate and that's all it would be having sat on the ATA and what's now the A4A boards and so forth, at least in the near term you're going to have a lot more use of video conferencing and very prudent steps to minimize a lot of business travel. I think, I think that's going to be a big one.",0.6060298,0.0
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,129,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And then third, we are already in the midst of this e-commerce revolution and we've leaned into it as we've said, particularly as we went into this fiscal year. I don't think that that's going to stop. And I think the major retailers are very heavily focused on that and people misunderstand the e-commerce market as not just one monolithic market, there is sort of the Tier 1 set of inventory, Tier 2 and Tier 3. Tier 1 are the things we use every day, paper towels and consumables in one thing and I believe I am correct and Amazon announced today or recently that they were going to restrict a lot of the non-essential products. So you see the big retailers and our big customers moving to be very effective competitors into this Tier 1.",0.4861111,0.171
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,130,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And to get to Raj and Alan's point, again we are very confident we are the low-cost producer. We didn't insource SmartPost because we felt it was a good idea. We did it because the basic math said that we should and with this Tier 1 short-haul e-commerce, we think we can be the low-cost producer and the market leader there.",0.3739837,0.75
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,131,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And in fact we don't think it, we know it, and so we've leaned into it painfully but we said that at the first of the year that this would be a year of challenge and change.

FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,132,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"Probably slower global GDP growth and international trade. We think we can take significant market share there, but we have to be very disciplined. And number two, I think you will have some changes in business travel, maybe all travel, but certainly business travel.

I can't really give it to you about Q4. I can tell you that, as I said, we got out there with Saturday and Sunday because we made the strategic move to get out there and do it. I think that will pay off in a big way and we start to lap that next fiscal year. We are halfway through of our technology implementations on our route optimizations and our scheduling.",2.4318841,0.671
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,136,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We're growing the densities as we grow the business. Every one of those things is driving down cost per package. We did get out with some of the Tier 1 closed zone pricing anticipating that we would over time get our cost down there so those would be more profitable. And so, yes, that's part of it as part of the strategy.",1.0536232,0.784
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,137,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"But as the way I said it before, I mean, I know where the costs are heading. I know what we're doing to get closer to customers on both sides of the equation where the traffic has an origin or where it has a destination. We're doing a great job with that. We talked about the regional sort facilities that we're putting up.",1.1293478,0.625
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,138,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So there are so many things under way and more to come, as, again, we're completely transforming Ground. We're not having the yields overall on a total standpoint because we don't have the B2B traffic we thought we would have. But we're managing through that and we'll get back on pace on that as well.",1.1108696,0.273

The good news here is the customers are, they are taking into service, and we are taking share, especially in the e-commerce space. And I think when you put the two factors together, it results in a positive outcome for Ground.",0.4441205,0.827

The demand we are seeing out of Asia right now is quite robust. And if you look for - the intra-Asia load factor is at a record, which is also very interesting - Asia to Europe and Asia to US. And the manufacturing capacity is coming back online, and the capacity of airfreight is down. So net-net, we are seeing the demand, and we should see that go forward.",2.0767736,-0.164

We're dealing with information that's literally 24 hours old. And trying to project that out is impossible. One thing that I know though is that 60% of the transatlantic traffic went on belly capacity. And as that capacity comes down, the capacity is going to be severely constrained. That much I can tell you. As far as the demand, we have to wait and see, and it's too early for me to say anything about that right now.",0.787172,-0.599
FDX-2020-Q3-2020-03-17,146,Answer,2020-03-17,3,2020,Rajesh Subramaniam,President & Chief Operating Officer,"So, nearly half of the SmartPost volume currently is delivered by ground service provider business and we expect to be virtually complete by the end of calendar year 2020 and with some of the exceptions that Brie talked about earlier. As to the contractual relationship with our independent service providers, these are great partners. They run very efficient businesses. They love the additional volume that they're getting. We work with them on a continuous basis to make sure that we're giving them everything they can. We're helping them with their scheduling, helping them build their density so they can make their business more profitable. So it's a great relationship.",0.781989,0.979

The economic outlook is highly uncertain making forecasting incredibly challenging. Around the world, we saw a marked decline in global economic activity in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020.

We had a significant shift in terms of how much B2C volume grew. And in our investment that we made on our seven-day network and all the other things that Henry had talked about earlier, just the market trends accelerated to meet our strategy, so to speak.

FDX-2020-Q4-2020-06-30,80,Question,2020-06-30,4,2020,Jack Atkins,Stephens,"Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And I don't mean to belabor the point on Ground, but I guess, I think what folks are trying to understand is - you guys have clearly done an excellent job driving top-line growth within the segment even through an extremely volatile macro environment. But at what point are we going to start seeing the leverage show up in the model within Ground? When will that delivery density and your pricing action, when will those begin to yield improved margins and profitability there? I think that's what people are really trying to understand.",1.6733212,0.972
FDX-2020-Q4-2020-06-30,81,Answer,2020-06-30,4,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Hey, Jack. This is Alan. Let me take my - give my friends a rest over here. I think they're showing up in the fourth quarter. I don't know anybody's making margins in Ground like we are, not even close. We're operating wide open, full throttle, seven days a week at max peak capacity. When you do that, you incur a lot of cost until you can get your feet on the ground, because it came on upon us so rapidly. So there'll be a period of time, remember, when we continue to catch up with our sorting facilities and our capabilities and our independent service provider get their legs under their feet on a more consistent basis and more routine.",1.2764493,0.681
FDX-2020-Q4-2020-06-30,82,Answer,2020-06-30,4,2020,Alan B. Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Obviously, residential deliveries in the growth of B2C are less productive than B2B. But as Brie mentioned in her opening remarks, B2B is coming back. So, we're working on every single aspect we can, mix, small and medium customers and costs. And I think I mentioned lowering cost twice in my opening remarks, and we're seeing that happening. So I think that's the answer. I mean we're going to continue to leverage this network. We'll get our feet under us and we're going to continue to deliver good results, I believe.",0.467029,0.542

Obviously, as I mentioned in my script, that we believe that e-commerce will remain elevated as a percentage of retail and that obviously capacity is a finite commodity in the market. We see a very rational market and we really see a great partnership with our largest customers. So, we are working with them absolutely to find a win-win solution, but part of that is that we will, as I mentioned, implement peak surcharges. This is part of the new normal. It will not be just for this fiscal year, but I anticipate customers to pay more for pricing in November and December moving forward. And I do think that, that will be a structural shift in the market.",0.7400589,0.41

Graf,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Again, I can't tell you much about 2021 because I just don't have a feel for what's happening as - nor does anyone else. I mean, the virus is seemingly coming back in a lot of states, openings are slowing down. People are delaying their openings. Microsoft shut in retail stores. Just a lot of things that are going on here that make it extremely difficult to answer that question. I can tell you from a strategic standpoint, I feel extremely confident about where we are if things go well, but that's a strategic comment not an FY 2021 comment, along the lines of how Raj answered that question.",1.0452899,0.226

That will help me a lot with the tax rate. Also, obviously, revenues and profitability and where they are around the globe, so the tax rate, it's pretty wide range for me right now. I'd tell you, I'm really proud of our tax team to be doing what they've done and how they held it down in FY 2020, which was spectacular. I believe Brie did discuss how we came off the bottom pretty nicely in April and we improved, and so that's in history. That's in the rearview mirror.

But we have been extremely disciplined in how we manage our cost structure in Express, all the way from managing our capacity and redeploying to where the demand is. I mean, as we talked to you about, we have the Air Capacity Coordination Center where we are actually moving the capacity very dynamically into the places where we can maximize our revenue and profitability. We have streamlined our organization structure and we are moving forward with our Last Mile Optimization program to make sure that we put the residential packages in the right network to reduce cost and improve density.

Carere,"EVP, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer","I think as Alan mentioned, you know I'm obviously not going to forecast volumes into FY 2021, but what I certainly can tell you is, I believe that the e-commerce change is structural. We have seen a huge uptick in the categories that people are willing to purchase online, certainly moved into a higher value. We saw this trend obviously pre-COVID, but it has accelerated when you think about things like furniture, large packages, high-value electronics.",0.5486009,0.938

From an e-commerce perspective, I do not anticipate that these buying behaviors will revert back, post-COVID. You might see some as a percentage of e-commerce decrease as retail itself grows. But overall, I believe that e-commerce will continue to stay elevated, and that will create strong demand for Ground for some time in the future.",1.0765832,0.735

And, Ken, obviously, we know where the biggest cash flows are coming from inside the company right now. So, we are going to continue to invest heavily in Ground and Ground will not see any reduction, probably an increase year-over-year in the amount of capital that we put in and doing a great job with it. They're figuring out very creative ways how to make it be more productive and obviously with seven days a week, wide open, they're sweating their assets a lot more.

And as far as air, as we said, we probably - early in the calendar year 2022, we'll have the air networks integrated, but I think with TNT as now - as part of the portfolio, we have a great opportunity to really improve the revenue and profit profile in Europe, B2B and B2C.",0.5056689,0.967

Because we had no idea where this was going, and so we did what we thought was the best balance between increasing our liquidity significantly enough to what we thought might be the worst case to make sure that we could maintain our operations because we are an essential service and we felt it was important to do that.",1.8898551,-0.128

I want to talk about FedEx Freight, much better yield growth in the overall LTL market, 10% on average between the priority and economy. I wanted to just get some color there.

One is the regional sort facilities are low cost, mainly short-haul inbound sortation facilities. I mean, it's brilliant with the team came up here, because we can put them up pretty quickly in existing buildings and they are nowhere near as expensive as building a hub. Longer term, and I guess shorter term and longer term and near term and longer term, I think the bigger issue we have with respect to your question, Brian, is van positions and the ability to load vans in existing end of line stations.",1.2227648,0.948

We are, as Alan said, prudent users of the shareholders' money here. We don't invest in things that don't produce a return, but all that being said, sooner or later, you run out of space and capacity for the volume we're seeing.

We've had $1.10 in the first and second quarters, but it dropped significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter.

FDX-2018-Q2-2017-12-19,129,Answer,2017-12-19,2,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So we have a couple of other questions here on CapEx and expensing, and the part that is often missed in the conversation because of the politics involved in this situation is if the tax bill works as anticipated, there will be a significant growth in GDP.",0.4424119,0.296
FDX-2018-Q2-2017-12-19,130,Answer,2017-12-19,2,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"And remember that the Business Roundtable did in a survey prior to this tax bill passing and 82% of the BRT membership anticipated that if it did pass that it would substantially increase their capital expenditures, and 75% anticipated that they would increase employment. Well, they're not making additional CapEx and increasing employment for any other reason than the market is growing.",1.348916,0.79
FDX-2018-Q2-2017-12-19,131,Answer,2017-12-19,2,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So if we increase capital expenditures, as Alan said, it will be because the market is growing. We think we can make more money and increase cash flows and so forth. But there's not just any willy-nilly interest in increasing CapEx other than for that except for one thing. In the case of expensing, you increase the net present value of the returns if it is a replacement piece of capital because you get in, in place earlier and you get your money right back.",0.0514905,0.915
FDX-2018-Q2-2017-12-19,132,Answer,2017-12-19,2,2018,Frederick Wallace Smith,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,"So to that extent, it would be bringing the money forward and not spending it later. It's the CapEx for GDP growth rates induced by the tax rate that is the important part of any increase in CapEx. And we'll identify which is which if we do that.

According to Forrester, the cross-border e-commerce represents roughly 11% of the total e-commerce market in 2017, but it's growing significantly faster, roughly 1.5 times faster.

I guess, it's one for Raj, but I want to appreciate Brie's thoughts as well, the pulling forward of your 2026 domestic growth expectations forward by three years to 2023 indicates to me that what you are seeing more than sustainable. So my question is, when you think about your Express, your Ground, your Freight networks, where do they sit today in terms of capacity utilization?

I think the market - the ecommerce market is large and it's growing and the growth has accelerated as pull forward by three years. And so, that's clear now.

I think they are very well aware that this is going to be a peak like no other. The most important thing for our customers' customers is to set appropriate expectations and give them transparency to the appropriate transportation commitments and we are working very hard to do that to set expectations to get visibility and to expose that to all our digital channels and our customers' digital channels.

Purchased transportation is driven by volume. I mean, all of our transportation is purchased with FedEx Ground. We don't have company-owned equipment. We don't have employee drivers. So, as the volume goes up, purchased transportation costs are going to go up. I think that something that maybe somewhat obscuring some of the numbers in there is the transit numbers of SmartPost Ground, because packages that formerly were treated as postage, because we paid the post office to deliver are now part of Ground settlement. That work will be done by the end of October with new exceptions.",0.4120505,0.273

We can scale down based on the volume. We contract with 5300 small businesses with employee something north of 130,000 employees. They see the changes in the volume at the micro level much faster than any of us could see it operating out of a corporate headquarter structure and they react almost instantaneously to any changes in volume, both up and down. So, this is not something that we haven't been through before. I mean, we've been through up cycles and down cycles. Sometimes it takes us a little bit longer to ramp up if we don't see it come in like this particular COVID-19 event.
