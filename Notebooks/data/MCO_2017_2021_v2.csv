The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was 21%, down from 29% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to lower U.S. statutory tax rate and net uncertain tax position benefits related to a statute of limitations expiration and audit settlement. Primarily due to our expectation for continued lighter debt issuance into the fourth quarter, we are reducing our outlook for full year diluted EPS to a range of $6.95 to $7.10, and adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $7.50 to $7.65. In response, we intend to undertake cost management activities, which will result in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $30 million to $40 million, and an aggregate charge to the first half of 2019 of $45 million to $60 million. We expect this to result in savings of $20 million to $25 million in 2019, and aggregate annualized savings of $30 million to $40 million thereafter.",1.4360487,-0.052

Moody's outlook for 2018 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued.

The expected restructuring charge of $0.10 to $0.15 and the acquisition-related expenses of $0.02 to $0.03. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be $7.50 to $7.65. Before turning to the Q&A, I would like to provide a few updates on recent acquisitions, investments and initiatives. On August 20, we announced the closing of the acquisition of Omega Performance, a leading provider of online credit training serving over 300 customers, ranging from large global banks to local lending solutions. Omega Performance will enhance MA as a worldwide market standard in credit proficiency for financial institutions that offer consumers, small business and corporate lending.

We have undertaken a careful review of our expense infrastructure to identify opportunities for efficiency. The cost management activities will primarily come from 2 separate and distinct areas, first, reducing, exiting and/or subleasing certain real estate property; and second, a targeted reduction in headcount, with an emphasis on streamlining our operations, eliminating redundancies and meeting regulatory expectations. We anticipate that the restructuring charge of $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the additional $10 million to $15 million in the first half of 2019 will result in an annualized pretax benefit of $30 million to $40 million once complete, and that the net pretax benefit for 2019 on a standalone basis is estimated between $20 million and $25 million.",1.0363086,0.936

I don't think I said temporary, but we are looking at a number of headwinds and tailwinds. And so determining which of those are going to be stronger going into 2019 and beyond is a little difficult to predict. But obviously, we are experiencing a rising rate environment, to the extent that the rising rate environment is associated with strong economic growth. That, as I've said before, encourages business expansion, business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity. The overall condition of the market, we think, is probably more important than the rates themselves. Rising rates with a maintenance of tight spreads because again, we're in a strong economy, is not a bad news story. What would be a bad news story is we talked about again before, is more of a stagflation environment. If for some reason, we were -- we at the market place was experiencing a rise, especially a short rise in interest rates, but unrelated to underlying core business strength. I don't think that, that's just going to be the situation. That doesn't look like the central case at this point, which is why you might interpret my comments as relating to a temporary slowdown.

I think the restructuring program was really driven by a combination of factors, and I can really think of the three primary ones. First is the expected continuation of the relatively soft issuance environment through year and. Secondly is an opportunity to rationalize our real estate footprint, specifically to include synergies from some of our recent acquisitions.

So curious if you could comment on that a little bit in terms of your own outlook or anything that you're seeing that may be different.

So we'd like to get to the end of the year where we can see where issuance ends up and then be able to triangulate both our bottom up forecast with what we're also seeing from the Street. But that's to give you a little feel for how we're looking at it. I mean overall, we still have economic growth, we saw today the U.S. GDP trend for the third quarter. At 3.5%, expectations for U.S. GDP growth of close to 3% next year and the major economies in Europe in the 1.5% to 2% range. So continuing to see economic growth. And Ray always talks about that, that's a key driver to issuance. I'd say modest geopolitical risks, we've got, I think, continued healthy investor demand, and we're seeing that now with pretty constructive market conditions albeit with some volatility and gradual rate increases. And again, that's the key here, is that they are gradual and well telegraphed. And we think also a strong M&A outlook going into next year.",0.8597929,0.972
MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,62,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"We've got a lot of LBO-driven M&A activity now in the market, and you can see that in the bank loan space. We think that's going to continue as well as some of the jumbo M&A. We've also -- expect default rates, particularly spec-grade default rates to remain low next year, that should contain spreads and then we balance that against, I would acknowledge that we're seeing both a combination of rates moving and I'd say in some cases relatively, liquid issuers, which I do think is waived on some opportunistic supply and we've seen that in the third quarter. We're going to have to look at the sustainability of the bank loan supply if spreads are not further tightening. And I think all in all, that translates into a corporate issuance outlook that's roughly in line with 2018, and we may see a modest rebound in U.S. high yield after a pretty sharp decline. And then maybe just touching on securitization. I think the trend there remains favorable or steady. It's a highly competitive market, but we do expect to see some growth on the back of again, economic growth and consumer sentiment that will be supporting securitization markets. Maybe just in terms of first-time mandates, I think, in our view is that, that's going to continue to provide some support for revenues going forward. So a lot of health warnings on that, we will tighten that up and be able to talk more about it on the next call.",1.0629853,0.947

As you're thinking to the remainder of the year, if I look at your updated guidance for the, I guess, implied guidance for the fourth quarter, if I'm correct for the corporate side, I think you're assuming a pretty big ramp in the fourth quarter, maybe something like 15% or so. It will be a very big ramp by historical standards, and I know the third quarter was soft. But I think some people called your guidance this morning still fairly aggressive in that area.

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,66,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. So you can see where we are in terms of year-to-date growth. I would say that we are expecting 4Q to show some sequential growth, certainly from 3Q '18, and that's the resumption of that more typical sawtooth pattern that we have typically seen except for last year. This year we saw that typical summer slowdown. Last year, you remember, every quarter saw sequential growth. So we think we're back to that sawtooth pattern. And think that 4Q '18 will be up on 3Q '18. We've got again, the technical issuance backdrop is good. I think our pipelines look generally healthy, the loan market is active, M&A inquiries are active. But we will need to see some degree of improvement and opportunistic issuance in 4Q versus 3Q to hit our outlook. And I would also note that we're not looking for the same levels of opportunistic issuance in 4Q that we saw in the first half of 2018, but certainly, a pick up from the third quarter. And the last thing I want to point out is, 4Q is going to be a tough comp, 4Q '18, tough comp to 4Q '17. You might remember we benefited from some of that pull forward in U.S. PMG, we saw some late jumbo investment-grade issuance and we put up something close to 20% revenue growth. So an acceleration, a pick up of revenue from 3Q into 4Q, but a deceleration of that kind of year-to-date growth rate, and that's how we got to our guide.",1.3809318,-0.973

In terms of just the recent weakness in issuance, I know that you could attribute part of it to rates. But do you also attribute part of it to tax reform? And when you do think about, if so, when you do think about tax reform's impact on issuance, do you see it as more of an ongoing phenomena since companies would be paying less tax and have more cash on the balance sheet? Or would you think about it as, this is a short-term impact because of the repatriation aspect, so there's less of an issue right now, and so therefore, maybe it's a little bit more temporarily. So I just wanted to talk about what you think is driving the recent weakness in addition to rates.",,-0.715
MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,69,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think I would place more weight on the repatriation, especially coming out of the tech sector. And that -- we discussed that earlier in the year as being a known headwind. But a somewhat concentrated headwind in that it was really the repatriation, the large dollars of repatriation were associated with large technology companies. And that, a large part of the corporate debt market, certainly in terms of our business, coming out of speculative-grade sector, is not an area where corporations have large amounts of offshore cash. So I think what we've seen in terms of a slowdown in spec grade bonds relates more to the rising rate environment and bank loans being favored over spec rate bonds rather than anything having to do with tax reform. That being said, the companies that have large amounts of overseas cash to be repatriated will have cash that can be repatriated again in 2019. So I don't expect that to be a very temporary or one-off phenomenon associated only with 2018.",2.0600811,0.66

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of what protects the business model and business performance in a negative environment, there's a number of things to look at. On the revenue side, look to the steady growth in recurring revenue versus transaction revenue at MIS. Pricing opportunities where we are providing particular value. The going forward benefit of new rating mandates that we have picked up in 2018, 2017, which translate into maintenance and monitoring fees on a going-forward basis. And of course, Moody's Analytics, which is not a capital market sensitive business and has a very heavy waiting to recurring revenue. As far as expenses are concerned, there is the formulaic flex in our incentive compensation that responds to what's happening with revenue and operating income. We can also modulate the pace of investments, and those are a variety of different investments whether they're technology-related or otherwise. But I would underscore that we think there are some very important opportunities for the company that we do want to put investment against.

We're seeing very good demand from a number of sources, and in a number of use cases for the BvD product. We're also building some very solid momentum as we begin to cross sell the BvD product to the traditional Moody's Analytics customer base. So we feel like we're doing quite well and performing very well, particularly on the sales side with Bureau van Dijk. And that strong sales growth will start to manifest itself in very good revenue production in the coming quarters. So things going quite well there. In ERS, we are -- I would say that things are going very much as we've expected and as we've been describing for you.

And our full year guidance would imply that our full year guidance of being down a couple of points would imply that the fourth quarter is going to be down for ERS. But the important thing to really look at, to understand where the business is headed, is to pick up on the details that Mark shared a couple of minutes ago. He mentioned that total ERS sales are up 4% on a trailing 12 months basis, and that's important because, in the first two quarters of this year, trailing 12 month sales in ERS were flat.

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,95,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Bill, this is Rob. Let me take that one. So I'd say they decelerated a little bit in the third quarter in tandem with the, kind of slowdown in issuance in leverage finance markets, so that's fairly typical. But we're still, overall on track for a very strong year. I mean, we're over 200 first-time mandates again signed in the third quarter, so yes, that's down from the second quarter of '18, it's actually, it's also down from last year's quarter. But we're now over 800 first-time mandates for the year through September, and we are still expecting to be above that 1,000 first-time mandates March -- for the full year. And you might remember, we were just north of that last year, it's something like 1,040. So a very strong case. I just touched on in my answer to Craig's question, we also have a number of unpublished mandates, particularly in China, so you've got some deals that haven't gotten approval to go-to-market, regulatory approval. Others are waiting on more favorable pricing conditions, given the volatility in the Chinese market, so there's a pretty robust backlog that hasn't gone into the market. The other things that's just worth noting is the first-time mandate growth has been now strongest out of the U.S. for the year. Now you might remember, we had a very mixed growth last year, but we've seen very strong growth out of the United States, and we have a good pipeline there.",2.624245,0.988

As I think everyone knows from our second quarter outlook, we do not anticipate the third quarter of 2018 behaving like the third quarter of 2017.

That's how we think about finance and how finance function interacts with the business itself. We did spend some time with our Board talking about that in our October meeting, and they are supportive of what we're trying to do here. On the restructuring, I do view this as an opportunity for us to create capacity, both to expand margins and to be able to reinvest back into the business.

I think we've talked about this before, but if you go back 2, 3, 4 years, we had a lot of demand being driven by post crisis regulation, whether it was Basel rules who are stress testing protocols, who were being applied to banks, whether in the U.S. or in Europe. There was quite a bit of regulatory-driven demand. That has been replaced by demand from banks that are looking to bring more efficiency and looking to streamline their processes, so that's where the loan origination product has been doing quite well. Lots of banks trying to compete, trying to make credit decisions and lending decisions faster and more efficiently, particularly in the midsized and small end of the corporate lending market. That's a very competitive business. And to be able to make a decision -- to be able to automate your decision process is becoming increasingly important.",0.4179875,0.776

We've also got demand coming from -- it's not strictly speaking regulated -- regulatory-driven, but we've got these new accounting standards. For a number of years we've been dealing with IFRS 9 outside the United States. That plays very well to our strengths and we've done a lot of business in that space. And now you've got a GAAP variant of IFRS 9 called CECL that is taking effect in 2020. That's driving a lot of demand for our solutions here in the U.S. And again, that's largely -- there we're largely focusing on smaller institutions. And we're doing quite well in that space. So those are the principal things that are driving demand for our ERS solutions at present. The one other area I should note, is again, an accounting-driven issue related to insurance companies. There's a requirement called IFRS 17, which is coming into effect over the next couple of years. That also plays very well to our analytical capabilities, and we've developed a solution for that and are seeing a lot of interest in it.

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,104,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Raymond W.

And those institutions are still subject to those rules, even though they've been relaxed for some of the smaller institutions in the U.S. So we don't see customer attrition or product attrition associated with the change in the volume of regulation. It's really a flow versus a stock question. I guess, the way I'd say it is, the stock of regulation is the same. We're just seeing less flow of new regulation driving new demand.",0.2812385,0.128

I'm recognizing since it's a sales number rather than a revenue number that can bounce around, and I guess, you're comparing it to the year-ago quarter when there's maybe some disruption I guess, because of the closing of the merger. Can you, I guess address that? Just how steady has that sales number growth been? And so, just trying to understand how outside the norm a 21% growth rate is for BvD?

But I think the more useful number, frankly, is the 14% year-to-date sales growth number that he cited. And then again, those are, both of those are at constant FX rates, so you don't have any currency noise in there. But the 14% rate, again, I think is a good reflection of the underlying performance of the business. The 21% Q3, frankly, reflected a bit of catch-up that we had from some -- from some operational issues that we talked about in the first quarter. But 14%'s a good number, and that's meaningfully stronger than where the business was performing when we acquired it.

It seems like from the guidance that you're expecting something like a $25 million sequential ramp in revenue. Where is that coming from?

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,109,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Mark Almeida,,"Yes, sure. I mean first, as we just discussed, there is strong underlying growth in the BvD business, and that acceleration in sales growth that we've talked about, that's going to start flowing through to the P&L, and it'll start hitting the top line. And so that's certainly contributing to a good strong fourth quarter that we expect. I think you've done the math correctly, Shlomo. The other thing you need to keep in mind is, you mentioned it, you've got the haircut going away, there was $22 million of haircut in the fourth quarter last year. We don't have that problem this year in the fourth quarter. And you've also got Reis coming in to the results this next quarter. So you've got those three things, strong underlying growth in BvD, the reversal of the haircut if you want to put it that way, and then Reis coming, in addition to what I would characterize as very solid performance in the rest of the business.",,0.979

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,111,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. When we look at the refi walls going out, actually, multiyear, they are increasing each year sequentially through 2022. So in terms of assessing the importance of the refi wall in 2019, because it is growing and the 2020 refinancing in 2021 are obviously, closer to the back half of next year, I think that's a reasonable expectation, that refinancing may tick up later in the year. That being said, a lot of this ends up being, I think, company psychology and the expectations and predictions that Chief Financial Officers and Treasurers are making about where rates are going to go, where spreads are going to go, and that can certainly drive issuance, refinancing issuance to get pulled forward further or to get pushed back further. So there's -- if you look at what has to be refinanced over the next few years, it is a very high wall, predicting exactly what quarter or quarters that may happen is a more difficult challenge.",0.1983045,0.757

But maybe just digging a little bit deeper, is there anything in the refi wall when you look in more depth that may be different? And when you think about the next few years, that it may not be refi-ing this much, meaning, for example, are there a lot of issuers that may have used that money for synthetic repatriation that may not just refi that money when it comes to? Or anything else? Are you hearing from companies that like, hey, we know this is coming due, but we are now in delevering mode.

MCO-2018-Q3-2018-10-26,114,Answer,2018-10-26,3,2018,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I think an important thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about opportunistic refinancing and the refinancing walls, we are largely talking about the U.S. speculative-grade sector. The investment grade sector refinances on a much more regular basis, steady basis year on year on year. And international companies, both investment grade and speculative-grade, have a history of refinancing on a more regular basis. The opportunistic refinancing comes out of U.S. spec grade, and those aren't companies that have a lot of overseas cash, as we've talked about before. So I don't think that's going to be an important factor. You could certainly have companies deciding that they wish to deleverage. But again, the ability to deleverage across the speculative grade universe and the desire to delever across the speculative-grade universe, I think is reasonably low. So yes, I can think of circumstances where refinancing may decline, but I don't think that's the central case.",2.1909325,0.75

Follow-up on the BvD question, on the growth there. I think someone decided, quarter-over-quarter, but I think year-over-year, if my numbers are correct, that growth was pretty soft as well. I get to maybe like 3%, 4%, 5%. So is there anything else going on other than the disruption, like any sort of customer loss or anything else that may weigh on that growth even going forward? Or you think we're now through this and some of the sales growth can actually translate into real revenue growth in the high single, low double-digit growth, just to circle back here.",,0.976

They do not appear to be -- like much of Moody's Analytics, all of Moody's Analytics really. We don't see, we have never seen much correlation between macroeconomic conditions, either on the positive side or the negative side and the performance of our business. It seems to be generally very, very steady growth in the business, irrespective of macro conditions. Except if we're at very extreme situations, such as we had in 2009, for example. And I believe that would be true of Bureau van Dijk as well. If you look at of their performance historically, as we did, of course, when we acquired the company, they performed well, even in the depths of the financial crisis. They performed, not spectacularly, but certainly above average, I would say. So we don't see much sensitivity in the Bureau van Dijk business.

And as I've talked about on prior calls, this year, we've experienced a dichotomy between the real economy and the credit markets. The real economy remained in flux as resurgent COVID-19 cases within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe caused these areas to begin rolling back reopening measures.

This is in stark contrast to the credit markets, where fixed rate bond issuance reached new records as issuers bolstered their balance sheets and opportunistically refinanced debt. The M&A pipeline showed positive indicators of recovery among investment-grade issuers. However, activity was still muted in comparison to the prior year.

Of that total, approximately 20% is forecast to mature in 2021. Furthermore, of the 2021 maturities, only about 1/3 are in the U.S., where we have seen the greatest amount of issuance this year. Our views that a portion of 2020 activity represents what we think of as contingent pull forward where companies issue debt to fortify their cash positions until they become more confident in the future operating environment. The extent to which this may then impact the refinancing of some 2021 maturities through cash on hand remains to be seen and depends heavily on how the economic outlook develops.",1.4190933,0.923

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The refinancing needs shown on this slide represent a robust base of future issuance, even though the average maturity has lengthened for investment-grade. Specifically, due to lower benchmark rates and steady spread tightening, U.S. investment-grade issuers have been incentivized to lengthen the maturity of their bonds to take advantage of low overall effective yields. This is evidenced by the higher year-to-date average investment-grade maturity of 14.5 years compared to 12.4 years in 2019. This was partially the outcome of a nearly 60% increase year-to-date in 11- to 30-year issuance, as shown in the light green bar on the left-hand chart.

While this is an important trend to follow, the impact to date has been relatively muted for 2 primary reasons. First, year-to-date, the increase in maturities was limited to investment-grade as speculative grade bond issuance saw a decrease in average maturity to 7.5 years due to the substantial rise in the use of medium-term maturity bonds.",0.7327682,0.527

High demand for our insights and analytics supported solid customer retention across both lines of business and an overall retention rate of 94% reflects the relevance and importance of our solutions during uncertain times. Stable retention rates, together with growth in subscription sales, led to better-than-expected performance in the third quarter.

It's good to go on, on top, Ray, and you set a tough bar for Rob, but it's a lot of hard work there. I wanted to start with just the margins in Moody's Analytics, really nice improvement. Just wondering if you could help us frame that out a little bit in terms of what drove it and how sustainable it is going forward?",,0.939
MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,64,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thank you for the question. And perhaps before I address the question directly, I thought, for context, it's worth noting that we had over 500 basis points of margin expansion in Moody's Analytics over the past 3 years, a very impressive result on a continued trend. For the third quarter specifically, the reported MA margin expanded by 220 basis points to 31.4% this quarter. And that was primarily driven by over 300 basis points of core expansion. And so I think about RD&A being 200 basis points of that and maybe ERS being around 100 basis points of that.",0.9625567,0.79
MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,65,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"And that was offset in part by incentive compensation trips during the quarter. We have maintained our 2020 MA segment margin guidance of approximately 30%. That represents over 200 basis points of margin expansion on a trailing 12-month basis from 2019. We do expect continued margin expansion over the long term. We may see some pressure in the next 12 to 18 months, depending on the ultimate duration and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 economic impact, but we do feel very positive about this business.",1.1955371,0.757

MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,68,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, sure. Yes, the overall retention rate across MA, as you say, has remained very strong. In fact, probably ticked up slightly. That's led by our research products and 96% retention there, very, very strong. I think what you're seeing is in an environment of uncertainty, our customers really, really value the insights and expertise that we're able to offer them. So I think that's supporting the retention. But you also see the retention rates in our ERS and BvD businesses. We have that on the webcast. And I think that goes to the fact that these are embedded into customer workflows and viewed as kind of must-have solutions. So when you think about the ERS suite of solutions, these are being used for loan origination, regulatory capital reporting, accounting, all sorts of things. So that supports those retention rates. And just like with BvD, a lot of that data is being used to support the compliance solutions, which again, really supports those retention rates.",0.8615186,0.981

The first question I had was just to try to think about some of the moving pieces, particularly around issuance in the fourth quarter. Clearly, there's going to be some election volatility, and that depends on how the markets should act. But what I wanted to ask was the surge in investment-grade and high-yield issuance that we saw that surprised a lot of us after the first set of lockdowns, in your sense, do you think a lot of the IG companies have raised cash in terms of maybe what they anticipate they needed?

The banks have seen record issuance, which was increasingly driven by opportunistic issuers looking to take advantage of historically low rates and tight spreads in the third quarter. Our fiscal and monetary responses have facilitated markets stability but companies continue to build liquidity reserves in case of uncertainty. As a result, the cash balances have surged over the last two quarters. The banks view it as likely that while a portion of this cash will be deployed in 2021 as business fundamentals normalize, the majority may be used to fund near-term debt maturities contingent upon the future operating environment. Specifically, the banks have also seen strong interest in longer 40-year bond durations and a notable increase in ESG and sustainability bond issuance.",0.2738275,0.714

However, some may continue to take advantage of favorable low rates and type spreads. And then to date, M&A activity or M&A-related issuance has been significantly returned. The pipeline looks relatively muted. However, there are indications that M&A volumes may be bottoming. Further uncertainty around the occurrence and timing of fiscal stimulus, rising infection, vaccine trials, election results and tenant rates, of course, are going to continue to weigh on the market.

Similar to the investment-grade market, active high-yield bond issuance has been driven by record low rates and tightening spreads. The volume of the high-yield bond issuance year-to-date has passed full year 2019 as well as the yearly totals for the last 10 years. Conversely, leverage loan issuance has lagged and that a weak technical backdrop slowing CLO formation and low demand. And for the remainder of the year, high-yield bond and leverage loan issuance is expected to slow in the fourth quarter.

MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,76,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Turning to European investment-grade. Despite the recent spike of COVID-19 cases, our Central Bank's support and strong investor demand have continued and spread narrowing, with investment-grade spreads recovering to about 80% of their levels before the pandemic. Our ESG issuance continues to increase with around 10% of corporate bond issuance in 2020 label this ESG bonds.

And Manav, what I might also do is maybe provide you a little bit of color on kind of what we're seeing in the KYC space. So as you know, we've got a leading position in that market. We're competing against players like Refinitiv, LexisNexis, Dun & Bradstreet and a number of others. But there's some interesting trends going on in the KYC space. So first, COVID's really accelerated a digital transformation in KYC and customer onboarding. And I think lockdowns have made the old-fashioned way of doing all this stuff quite challenging. Companies are looking for more precise filters and ways to focus what and when they look at individuals and entities. And we actually had a very large bank tell us recently that for the first time, their legal and compliance teams are pushing for their KYC teams to use external vendors and solutions that better leverage data and technology than what they're doing in-house.",0.3735979,0.951

So we're going to give -- as you noted, we're going to give our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call like we normally do. I think in particular, this year, it's going to be very important to see how 2020 ends in terms of issuance. Because that's going to be a material factor in pulling together our 2021 outlook. We see a real drop-off in issuance after the elections, then we may have some pent-up demand starting off in 2021. I guess, I would say, in general, from where we sit right now, I think the headwinds probably outweigh the tailwinds. And very importantly, because we've had 2, and I'm including this year, too, very strong issuance years.

One, obviously, the potential for improving economic growth and an increase in M&A activity. We've certainly seen an uptick in M&A activity this past quarter. And I think we could see more sponsor-driven and distressed activity next year. Sustained Central Bank's support, along with potentially another round of stimulus. And obviously, I think a continued low rate environment that's going to be supportive of refinancing those maturity walls that we showed in the webcast deck.

Various parts of structured finance. We could see ongoing U.S. public finance and infrastructure issuance taking advantage of very low rates. Then we weigh that against the potential headwinds. And starting with, like I said, a very elevated issuance that we've seen this year, particularly in investment-grade, which, as we said, we expect to be up around 60% versus 2019. That's a hard act to follow. And we've talked about the elevated liquidity at a lot of issuers. You heard that from Mark in terms of what the banks are thinking.

And I would have expected costs returning following the 2Q lockdowns, et cetera. And so just maybe a continued increase in incentive comp, given issuance has been so strong.

MIS margins this quarter were very strong. The 64.2% result was up around 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. And there were 2 very strong underlying drivers to that. The first was very strong revenue performance, obviously, in the quarter. And the second was very strong cost discipline that we showed throughout the quarter. As I think through what the potential temporary and the permanent related items could be in the quarter, we looked at a variety of factors. And that includes activities the management team is taking around restructuring, increased automation within MIS, the utilization of lower cost locations or procurement efficiencies, and then obviously, a real estate optimization.

One thing I would ask, though, about 2021, Rob, you just mentioned the loan business having some very easy comps next year, and I guess, that makes a little bit more bullish on that business next year.

So again, this whole -- there's really a set of interdependencies between what's happening politically, what's happening with the disease and what's happening in the economy more broadly, and they play off of each other.

I mean, obviously, we've had a little bit of slowdown from the rate of recurring revenue growth that we saw in the second quarter. I think it was something like 5%.

Looking forward to continuing the great work with you guys. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about free cash flow. You touched on the cost expense management that will help free cash flow. It seems like while things have been strong and obviously, guidance has taken up, generally, it seems like that maybe there was a little bit of a slippage, a little bit of a disconnect in that conversion from EPS to free cash flow and EPS, taking up a little bit more.

So this morning, we raised both our full year adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance by approximately 12%. And based on those midpoints, we are expecting our full year adjusted EPS to grow approximately 21%. And our free cash flow to grow approximately 12% for the year. And that's really the numerical disconnect that you're highlighting. And the primary driver behind that is really simply due to working capital headwinds that we mentioned earlier this year.

And we pull share repurchases just out of an abundance of caution.

But in other cases, caused that issuance to either be accelerated in the case of parts of the municipal sector or did have some effect at the margin.

And Ray, I just want to thank you again for all your help over the years. I know you had a previous question that thought that 2020 was over, but we do have a couple of months left, so I just want to ask about your 2020 guidance. If I look at the implied 4Q guidance for MIS, I think, it's implying a low single-digit revenue decline, but pretty adverse decremental margin impact.

MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,126,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Your math is correct. Specifically, for the fourth quarter, our guidance would imply sort of a low double-digit decline in MIS revenue. And on the expense side would imply sort of a high single-digit low -- high -- low single digits or the low end of mid-single-digit increase in expenses. Specifically, if I think about the expense ramp really from the first to the fourth quarter, that's really now expected to be around $50 million, and that's really related to costs associated with incentive comp, other charitable contributions.

But thanks for the well wishes. So maybe 3 primary drivers of that RD&A organic constant dollar growth that we're seeing, and it's really research data feeds and these compliance solutions, the KYC solutions in the BvD, RDC business. In research, I touched on there's really strong retention rates. That 96% in research is actually slightly up over the last 12 months. That's a remarkably good figure. And the yield on this existing base from upgrades and price-related to our enhanced credit view platform is, I think, what's driving that growth. In data feeds, it's interesting. We did some things around sales deployment to get both new logos, but also to sell more product into existing customers to serve a little bit broader range of use cases at these customers.

If we encounter a situation in 2021, where you're dealing with the confluence of -- we drove much weaker year-over-year issuance just because of what we saw the strength in this year, together with the fact that we will hopefully have more of an opening up of the economy in general in terms of people traveling and more expenses creeping in. What are the main levers that you have to go ahead and kind of manage the margins? And just like philosophically, when you manage the business, is that something that you focus on in the heightened way in the near term?

And that's going to be achieved through some of the cultural expense discipline around, again, managing those core expenses down to self-fund, and that we're going to achieve those savings from procurement activities, IT efficiency, travel and entertainment, real estate, et cetera.

Maybe let me just talk to you about kind of what we're seeing right now. We -- given how strong investment-grade has been year-to-date, we are seeing some, I'd call it, headlines impacting the investment-grade market, similar to the equity markets. It's elections, earnings and section stimulus. I would note that funds flows into investment-grade continue to be strong. We've had something like 28 consecutive weeks of inflows, and the fed continues to be a small buyer in the secondary market, and that provides some support.",0.3597929,0.953
MCO-2020-Q3-2020-10-29,163,Answer,2020-10-29,3,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Meanwhile, the conditions in the leveraged finance markets are very conducive to issuance. And that's interesting because usually that doesn't happen when we see this kind of equity market volatility. But up until very, very recently, we've seen some relatively aggressive deals, dividend recaps, LBOs, and that's even corresponded with an uptick in leverage loan activity. So we may see the balance of issuance a little bit weighted to leverage finance. But I think some of the strength that we're seeing in the activity has just been issuers trying to get ahead of the election-related volatility. And as we talked about, and I think we're going to see that activity slow to the end of the year. The last thing I would say is with the upcoming holidays, there are just -- there are fewer and fewer windows for issuance for the remainder of the year.",0.6544435,0.785

So for my question, I want to go back to buybacks. If I'm doing my math correctly, dividend and share repurchases in total is above 50% of free cash flow this year. Is there any room to be more aggressive, given that you had targeted 80% in the past and where the share is trading?",,0.934

If we hypothetically carry forward the dividend rate through to year-end, that would put dividends at roughly $420 million and share repurchase guidance of approximately the $500 million we spoke about earlier, which would be about 50% of our approximately $1.8 billion free cash flow guidance.

And as we said, strong sales of credit wins and IFRS solutions and insurance solutions. So we've seen, as we sunset one of our origination products, we've seen a very good kind of renewal cycle around that. And in fact, subscription growth for our credit origination -- credit assessment origination has been something like north of 30% year-over-year. And that's, again, driven by that -- those year-to-date sales of the CreditLens software. But IFRS 17 continues to contribute to that as well.",0.3688525,0.985

So I think what we're likely to see is the broadening of KYC to go beyond simply serving regulatory requirements at financial institutions. And you heard me talk a little bit earlier about, in addition to increasing regulation, you've got institutions who also just want to have a better understanding of who they're doing business with. And going beyond, for instance, financial crime into things like reputational risk, data security, social issues around modern slavery and things like that. So I think what that means is, in addition for drivers for KYC, I think we may start to see -- customers start to look at this kind of data to understand their supply chain risks to -- we've talked about on calls before, kind of a know-your-supplier use case.

I think more broadly, we've shown before that the broader regulatory and accounting drivers for our MA business. So there's a whole host of different kinds of regulation, not just KYC but things around stress testing, regulatory capital calculations, Basel, solvency, a whole range of things that I think are driving demand for both the existing MA products as well as opportunities for us to fill product gaps to meet more and more of these regulatory requirements as they evolve.",0.0836928,0.153

Just in terms of -- across all those different opportunities you have, how you think monetization of those will develop over time? And I'm thinking because over the next decade, I would imagine that a lot of the ESG data that were -- that companies and investors and companies using would ultimately become just part of the existing process that we have today.

It's what you're getting at is eventually the data, which right now is hard to get, right? So there's real value in good, high-quality data. But over time, as there are standards around disclosure requirements, as there is automation on -- through XBRL, the data itself, I think, will become more commoditized. And what will really be valuable is the insights. So I think you're going to see part of the industry evolve. I talked about the sustainability ratings and second-party opinions.

And then I think you're going to see, like I talked about earlier, the integration of this content into risk-management offerings, right? So every financial institution, bank insurance company in the world is going to have to be really thinking about these nonfinancial risks, ESG, climate, and they're going to have to be integrating them into their origination platforms, they're monitoring up their portfolios. I talked about stress testing. We're seeing Bank of England with a climate stress test and banks are going to have to comply with that. So I think you're going to see the monetization of that ESG content through the risk-management segment.

During this challenging time, we remain committed to our corporate social responsibility efforts as we and the rest of the world deal with both the global COVID-19 pandemic as well as civil unrest. Our mission to provide trusted insights and standards that help decision-makers act with confidence has never been more relevant, and our operating results reflect that. Echoing the first quarter, Moody's strong second quarter was once again driven by robust top line growth at Moody's Investor Service as issuers sought liquidity and opportunistic refinancing amid broadly receptive credit market conditions.",1.5248802,0.984

As the second quarter exceeded our expectations, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $8.80 to $9.20, while still expecting debt issuance to taper in the second half of the year. Amidst the global pandemic and with the emergence of civil unrest focused on racial equality, the safety and well-being of our employees remains Moody's top priority. We are committed to providing a safe work environment for everyone. As such, we have been conducting awareness and training campaigns and encouraging our employees to speak out and engage with each other on these important topics. We are also building better programs to attract, retain and advance black talent.

These offerings within the first half of the year translated into about $12 million of in-kind contributions. In addition, we've committed $1 million to promote equal justice and the advancement of the black community while also increasing financial support for our partners focused on empowering black-owned businesses and enhancing diverse recruiting. Finally, before I get to the results for the quarter, I would like to draw your attention to the recent announcement made on the enhancements to our environmental sustainability program.

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,11,Remarks,2020-07-30,2,2020,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Moving on to second quarter 2020 results. Moody's achieved a robust 18% increase in total revenue, with 27% growth from MIS and 5% growth from MA. Moody's adjusted operating income of $766 million was up 28% from the prior year period. Strong revenue growth, combined with ongoing discipline and expense management, drove 410 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.81 was up 36%. I will now provide an update on the credit markets in the second quarter. The pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the global economy, resulting in widespread unemployment, negative global GDP estimates and other recessionary conditions as countries shut down their economies in order to contain the spread of the virus. This morning's reported second quarter U.S. GDP contraction of nearly 33% is a stark reminder of this. To mitigate the economic impact, governments have undertaken unprecedented global monetary easing efforts and fiscal actions which have thus far enabled supportive fundamentals and robust activity in the credit and equity markets. Most recently, we've observed the EU proposal to raise debt to fund the EUR 750 billion stimulus plan to aid its member nations hardest hit by the pandemic. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has extended its emergency support facilities to the end of the year, and the U.S. government is in discussions to extend fiscal stimulus measures. As the credit markets continued to read through severe economic stresses and governments quickly took actions to mitigate them, the dichotomy with the real economy remained. Investment-grade issuers responded to economic uncertainty by shoring up their balance sheets with record levels of bond issuance.",0.4688537,0.84
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,12,Remarks,2020-07-30,2,2020,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Additionally, after being inactive for most of March, high-yield bond issuance surged as spreads tightened. The leveraged loan market reopened but has been slower to recover. Looking towards the second half of the year, we expect issuance to moderate as many countries and institutions have completed their balance sheet and liquidity strengthening initiatives, and governments may see less of a need to intervene in support of their economies. As I just noted, given uncertain economic conditions, companies look to bolster their balance sheets in the first half of the year while capital markets were receptive. As you can see from the chart, working capital and debt refinancing became more prominent drivers of issuance, whereas mergers and acquisitions has historically been a more often cited use of funds. This rush to liquidity also helped to explain the dichotomy between the performance of the economy and capital markets as many issuers took advantage of low rates to create fortress-like balance sheets to help see them through this period of uncertainty and stress. I'd like to further highlight second quarter issuance, specifically within the corporate finance sector. As you can see, second quarter corporate investment-grade issuance was up significantly, together with solid high-yield supply, but bank loans continued to lag. This mix caused the rate of corporate finance issuance growth to outpace transactional revenue growth due to larger, more frequent issuers coming to market.",0.2030962,0.947
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,13,Remarks,2020-07-30,2,2020,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Despite this headwind, issuance growth was beneficial to our operating results, and MIS exhibited significant top line growth, which Mark will discuss further. COVID-19 has had wide-reaching impact on nearly every sector of our global economy. In the second quarter, the default rate rose, and as Mark will touch upon later, our guidance assumes it will continue to do so through the end of the year. During these turbulent times, the quality and consistency of ratings becomes even more important. Therefore, investors look for transparent methodologies that follow a measured, thoughtful and systematic approach. Moody's processes ensure that we are consistent and rigorous in delivering our rating opinions and research. Our starting point is to assess and rank the impact of an event, such as COVID-19, and what it has on various sectors. This then flows through to the underlying issuers, as shown in the chart on the bottom left, which list the most impacted sectors and the percentage of issuers downgraded within each of those sectors. It is important to note that ratings quality remains MIS' top priority, and we continually strive for exceptional ratings performance. As you can see from the graph on the bottom-right corner, Moody's ratings have performed very well on an ordinal ranking basis with lower-rated debt exhibiting higher default rates for the trailing 12 months as of the end of June 2020.",0.3309989,0.949

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Through Moody's long history of ratings quality, investors have come to expect our ratings to look through the credit cycle so that in uncertain times like these, investors can compare ratings not just by issuer but also over time. Turning to MA. I want to update you on how the business continues to adapt to the current environment. Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-19 could impact our customer renewals and new sales activity. We are encouraged by the observed trends in both of these categories as they are proving to be better than expected. MA's retention rates remained strong at 94%, demonstrating the relevance of our products during times of stress, while sales grew despite the lack of in-person meetings, providing us with momentum as restrictions begin to ease outside the U.S. Looking toward the sales pipeline for the second half of 2020, we are more optimistic than in our prior outlook as compliance and accounting products have provided better-than-expected growth opportunities despite current headwinds. Throughout this challenging time, we've remained focused on our customers' rapidly evolving needs for integrated and holistic risk solutions. This slide highlights some of our second quarter innovations and enhancements that increase the collective value of our offerings. I will focus on the recent additions and improvements to our ESG and climate product suite as well as the new Pulse tool. Thought leadership in ESG and climate risk remains a key strategic priority for Moody's as its importance for our customers continues to grow, and we are encouraged by the demand for these products. In the first half of this year, Vigeo Eiris completed 29 issuer paid sustainability ratings, 46 second-party opinions and nine sustainability-linked loan assessments.",0.2366384,0.992

We are also excited to announce that through partnerships with Euronext and Solactive, we continue to build our presence serving the index space, including the creation of the new Euronext ESG80 and Solactive VE Developed Markets ESG Quality Indices, which use Vigeo Eiris data to screen its constituents. In addition to these new ESG and climate risk initiatives, we are further integrating Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven content into multiple MA platforms, including moodys.com and REIS, which should provide additional channels for exposure and monetization. Moving on to Pulse. This tool was launched by the Moody's Accelerator to help our customers quickly consume and digest the ever-increasing news flow. Pulse utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to gauge sentiment around news, such as COVID-19, on a chosen company or sector, enabling investors to more quickly assess the impact of a news article on their portfolios.

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,18,Remarks,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Strong activity in the fixed rate bond markets was partially offset by weakness in bank loans as investor demand remain muted for floating rate instruments in a low for long rate environment. Structured finance was the only line of business that experienced an overall decline in revenue, primarily due to a decrease in asset origination. Total MIS rated issuance growth of 53% exceeded total transactional revenue growth of 39%. As Ray noted, issuance mix was skewed towards large frequent issuers in corporate finance, and this was also the case in public, project and infrastructure finance. MIS adjusted operating margin expanded by 390 basis points as revenue growth significantly outpaced the increase in operating expenses. MA's second quarter revenue growth of 5% or 8%, excluding the impact of the MAKS divestiture and acquisitions, along with FX headwinds, demonstrated resilience as customers came to Moody's in search of integrated risk solutions. RD&A revenue grew 16% or 7% on an organic basis driven by strong demand for know your customer solutions as well as credit research and data feeds.

Before I turn to our full year 2020 guidance, I will mention some of the macro assumptions that have changed since our last earnings call and which continue to shape our outlook for 2020. Notably, we have shifted the majority of our key directional markers from decelerate to accelerate, as shown on the right-hand side of the slide. We consider these markers in our updated base case scenario, which assumes a continuation of the nascent economic recovery into the second half of 2020 and nonlinear improvement in COVID-19 cases. Our macroeconomic assumptions include: 2020 U.S. and Eurozone GDP to decline approximately 6% and 9%, respectively; the U.S. unemployment rate to end the year at approximately 10%; benchmark interest rates to stay low with high-yield spreads remaining in excess of 650 basis points; and the high-yield default rate to rise to approximately 9%.

These include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the responses to the pandemic by governments, businesses and individuals as well as the effects on interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt markets.

Specifically, our forecast for the remainder of 2020 reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.24 and for the euro of $1.12. We have raised our full year guidance for most key metrics as compared to the prior forecast and now anticipate that Moody's revenue will increase in the low single-digit percent range. Our upward revenue revision outpaces that of our operating expenses, which we now expect to be approximately flat year-over-year. The resulting improvement in operating leverage supports our upwardly revised adjusted operating margin guidance from a range of 46% to 48%, 48% to 49%. We are reaffirming both the net interest expense and the full year effective tax rate guidance ranges of $180 million to $200 million and 19.5% to 21.5%, respectively. We have increased and narrowed the diluted EPS forecast to now be in the range of $8.15 to $8.55 and the adjusted diluted EPS forecast to now be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. The guidance assumes an anticipated restructuring program in the second half of 2020 around the rationalization and exit of certain real estate leases estimated to result in total pretax charges of approximately $25 million to $35 million and estimated annualized savings of $5 million to $6 million, respectively.

Many issuers have fulfilled their near-term funding needs, some having come to market multiple times. As COVID-19 has been more impactful on first-time issues than anticipated, we have reduced our first time mandate forecast from 600 to 550. We also anticipate that M&A activity will remain constrained in the second half of 2020. Finally, we believe that there will be a lower proportion of infrequent issuer activity leading to a less favorable mix. The MIS adjusted operating margin is forecast to be in line with the prior year at approximately 58%. We are pleased to reaffirm MA's full year top line growth and margin improvement guidance due to its strong recurring revenue base and renewal activity.

Wanted to start off by asking just about your outlook for MIS and embedded inside of that, your issuance outlook. You gave helpful color certainly on the changes to that guidance. I was hoping that maybe you could pull back the covers a little bit more just in terms of what you're expecting in so far as that tapering down of issuance. To what extent is this just a function of tougher year-over-year comps, how much pull forward you perhaps think that there was into the first half? And then thinking longer term perhaps, maybe that there's some sustainability in those higher liquidity-driven fortress balance sheet increases.",,0.92
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,30,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"This is Mark. What we'll do here is similar to what we've done in the past where I'll talk a little bit about issuance drivers that we're hearing from some of the banks, and then I'll turn it over to Rob to follow up with our internal viewpoint. Starting with the U.S. investment grade, the banks have seen record activity in the first half of the year with year-to-date issuance volumes already above full year 2019 levels. Early in the quarter, many issuers that came to market were towards the higher end of the investment-grade spectrum, but access broadened considerably when spreads tightened as a result of the Fed's liquidity programs. The main issuance drivers were liquidity and refinancing, as you mentioned. The latter of which was opportunistic in nature, in some instances, as issuers capitalized on low effective yields. For the remainder of the year, what we're hearing from the banks is that while market conditions remain favorable, many investment-grade borrowers have already issued at least once in the first half, and the M&A pipeline remains relatively light. Furthermore, I'd say the pandemic, the pace of economic recovery, the upcoming U.S. election and relationships between the U.S. and China continue to be prominent concerns as the banks have expressed. Looking forward, the banks are expecting a much lighter second half of the year. Nevertheless, for full year 2020, they expect U.S. investment-grade issuance to be up 40% to 50%.",0.470121,0.799
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,31,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"And then just from my side, one item just to keep in mind is that for comparative purposes, the banks seeing investment-grade issuance are inclusive of financials. Moving on to U.S. speculative grade; once activity resumed following the slowdown in March due to COVID-19, issuance recovered with a record second quarter. The Fed's expansion in scope of its asset purchases to include high-yield corporate debt was supportive of the market, and that helped spreads narrow considerably from the peak in late Q1. This, in turn, broadened market access and enabled a greater number of corporates at the lower end of the speculative grade to complete transactions. On the other hand, leveraged loans remain weak overall despite some positive bursts of issuance in the second quarter, and this was due to a significantly reduced M&A pipeline, lower levels of new CLO formation and a greater preference for fixed rate debt. Despite the improvements that the banks noted that they saw in the speculative grade market, they did have some concerns that remained around credit quality, default risk and secondary market volatility. For the full year, the banks indicate that U.S. high-yield bonds are expected to be flat to up 10% and that U.S. loans are likely to decline by approximately 20% to 30%.",1.6792738,0.455
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,32,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Turning briefly to European investment grade; year-to-date issuance volumes have been robust with record second quarter volumes as the market recovered from the COVID-19-related volatility in March. While monetary policy and increasing fiscal support have helped narrow spreads, they do remain well above pre-COVID-19 levels. Furthermore, low effective yields in the U.S. investment-grade market have made reverse Yankee issuance less attractive. And given the record supply in the first half of the year and the limited M&A pipeline, the banks expect a significant decline in issuance in the back half of 2020. For the full year, the banks forecast European investment-grade issuance to be within the range of flat to up 10%. And finally, European speculative grade has seen a mixed recovery following the market disruption in March, with improvement in high-yield bonds, while loans remained quite weak. Although spreads have tightened, they have not fully recovered from prior widening, and access to the market remains concentrated towards the higher end of spec grade. While there have been a few recent M&A announcements, in general, the banks believe the pipeline remains light.",0.9213313,0.813

So let me focus on what this means for our full year outlook for issuance, and in particular, what it implies about the second half of the year because I know that's an area of real interest to many people on this call. So as we indicated on the webcast, we're now looking at low double-digit growth and global-rated issuance for the year. And that implies issuance in the back half of the year is going to be down in the neighborhood of mid-teens percent versus the second half of 2019. The outlook that we've got for the second half of the year is pretty consistent with that actually, it's probably slightly more constructive than our outlook for the second half on our last earnings call. So what we've done is essentially taking the excess issuance from the second quarter into the forecast and maintained a fairly consistent outlook for the second half of the year.",1.2398619,0.908
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,35,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So, let me just break it down by segment. Again, I know there's some interest in this. If you round numbers, we've done about $1 trillion in global investment-grade year-to-date. We expect that, as we said, to be up 50% for the year. That implies essentially flat for investment-grade corporates for the second half of the year. So what that really means then is that we're expecting essentially a business as usual environment like we had in the second half of 2019 for the investment-grade market. That's contrasted obviously to what we saw in several months here in the beginning of the year. There are a few things underpinning that. Obviously, all this significant opportunistic activity we've had.",0.2040552,0.751
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,36,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Mark just took you through the bank outlooks. And I think our outlook is quite consistent with what you're hearing from the banks. And then finally and we've been signaling this since the beginning of the year, just the potential volatility in the second half around U.S. elections and any kind of second wave. On leveraged finance, we're slightly more constructive, as I think you saw from the numbers in the webcast deck, than we were back in the first quarter. But that said, we still expect both markets to be down meaningfully for the back of the year. And that's due to the all that surge in financing Mark touched on as well as the expectation of credit issuance Ray and Mark touched on our view in defaults. So we're looking for high yield to be up 5% for the full year, loans down 20%. On structured finance, looking at down 40%, and that is a little bit we've moderated that outlook a little bit since the first quarter. So we've taken that down just a little bit given what we're seeing in CMBS and CLOs just being very heavily impacted with a much softer investor bid there.",0.1941329,0.572

Just you guys reiterated your guidance for the top line and for margins, which implies that the back half is going to see a stronger year-over-year impact in terms of that margin.

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,40,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thanks, Ray. In the second quarter, we reported margin expansion of 50 basis points from 28.2% to 28.7%. If I think about the breakdown of that, that's around 130 basis points of growth from core MA, primarily driven by RD&A, 90 basis points of growth from the MAKS divestiture, offset by some of the inorganic acquisitions. And then around 160 basis points of contraction from incentive comp true-ups and FX. As you noted, we have maintained our 2020 MA segment margin guidance of approximately 30%, which represents, I'd call it, around 250 basis points of margin expansion on a trailing 12-month basis from 2019. We do expect continued margin expansion over the longer term, but we may see pressure in the next 12 to 18 months, depending on the duration and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 economic impacts. And I'd go through maybe just a quick a few more points here. The plan for really MA margin improvement is to continue many of the initiatives that are already underway. So for example, first in ERS' ongoing transition to a Software-as-a-Service model which is multiple benefits beyond just increasing recurring revenue.",1.3339637,0.883
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,41,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Second is the synergies between BvD and RDC. We previously mentioned strong growth we're seeing from BvD, and we have already said in past earnings call that we expect a nearly 20% CAGR for those compliant solutions in the combined BvD, RDC business. And then third is the increasing efficiencies across Moody's Analytics, and that's by a combination of new cost savings initiatives, increasing operating leverage as the business scale up, etc. So there are a number of things that we're doing to maintain and continue to grow margin over time.",0.5820726,0.868

Obviously, you gave guidance last quarter, and the second quarter surprised a lot of people, right? So you're definitely too conservative, and that's not wrong. I mean unprecedented times. But if you look forward here, I mean, I guess, why should we have confidence in that outlook?

Like what are the things that we should be watching the most where it could be different to the outcome?",,0.97

But you're right, we were much too conservative about second quarter activity at the time of our prior earnings call. And that was in part an underestimation on our part of the scope of emergency support that would be coming from the government, extending down into the speculative grade area and really providing a lot of market confidence against what was happening in the real economy. And as we look forward, certainly, the extension of that emergency support and, again, the continuation of market confidence because of that could be one source of upside going forward. And that's in addition to the obvious things like creation of a vaccine sooner rather than later, the recovery of the economy taking on a sharper V-shape and really a return to confidence in business expansion that comes from that.

And Alex, maybe just to now kind of maybe tie it a little more specifically to how we're thinking about the issuance outlook and how you might think about upside and downside to where we are. A few areas, I think there could be some upside. There can be some more runway for non-U.S. issuers, and we've obviously seen enormous issuance in the United States. Very strong in Europe but not as strong as the United States. So there's the possibility we could see something there. Some sort of sustained run of supply in the leveraged finance market, fall in angel issuance, improvement in the outlook for the bank loan sector. M&A, we touched on that, down very sharply. I mean we're seeing levels that we haven't seen for years. Announced M&A is down something like 50% year-to-date. But there's the possibility that we could see some distressed M&A. There are some deals getting done. So any kind of uptick to the M&A environment would provide some upside. And then and this may not materialize in 2020. But if there were an infrastructure bill, if there were ultimately changes to the Tax Reform Act and the refunding restrictions that impacted the public finance market, like I said, that's probably a next year thing rather than this year.",0.2773943,0.964

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Alex, one area that could be a plus or a minus is the nature of the borrowing that has been going on and the question of whether it's pull forward or whether it's not. And so I think of that as what we've seen in the second quarter and what we probably will see in the second half of the year is what you might think of as a contingent pull forward in that as companies become more comfortable that they don't need to hold as much liquidity and hoard cash to the degree that they are currently, they could use that cash on the balance sheet to pay maturing debt. If they don't remain confident with the ability to use that cash, if they feel they need to hold dry powder back into the market.

I would like to maybe first highlight that this real estate-related restructuring program is one aspect of the disciplined cost management that we've exhibited in this challenging environment. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, our adoption of technology and the ability to transition smoothly to working virtually has enabled us to consider by working with our employees to design and develop the beginning of the format of our offices going forward. This will include what we think of as an enhanced capability to attract and retain the best talent, not just in our standard locations, but potentially anywhere. I mean to your point, for those who have not seen it yet in the press release, our guidance assumes an anticipated restructuring charge in the second half of 2020 around the rationalization and exit of certain real estate leases that are estimated to result in total pretax charges of $25 million to $35 million.",2.4602874,0.873

I maybe start off by noting that Moody's fully allocates our corporate expenses out to our business segments, which could be different than the approach taken by some of our peers. Now second quarter 2020 MIS expenses were $369 million, which are up actually 5% over the prior year period. However, if we adjust for several one-off expense items this quarter, including, but not exclusively, things like a legal accrual, prior M&A and higher incentive compensation related to strong business performance, then MIS expenses would actually have been down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And that would have translated to an additional 300 to 400 basis points of margin that you would have been able to see in our reported results.",0.8664902,0.814

But Rob, I'm wondering if there's a way to talk us through the bridge of how low double-digit increases in issuance results in low single-digit increases in MIS. And I know you attribute it to mix, but is there some way to quantify or frame the mix impact just so that when we're thinking about our estimates going forward, we sort of have some inputs in terms of being able to understand what the mix impact looks like?",,-0.361

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,60,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. And maybe let me just start with kind of how it worked out in the quarter, and I can talk a little bit about then how we think about that for the outlook. But obviously, this quarter, we saw a less favorable mix. The primary drivers of that were just all this investment-grade issuance, where we've got a greater mix of issuers on frequent issuer contracts. And we also saw some strong issuance from the PPIF segment, including sub-sovereign. And there, we tend to have a little bit lower yields and also infrastructure where we saw some lower-yielding jumbo issuance. So we had said this, I think, earlier in the year that we thought mix was going to be uncertain factor and could actually provide a little bit of headwind for us. And I think our view is that, that is consistent for the back half of this year.",1.7377049,0.801

We don't get the same bump when issuance goes up in that sector as we do in the speculative grade sector.",1.5311463,0.691

Kevin, so let me talk a little bit about how we're working together between BvD and RDC and the kinds of synergies that we're seeing. Obviously, we've got a challenging sales environment. But the sales teams at both companies have been working together have an opportunity to offer a more complete solution, even though we haven't fully integrated those solutions yet, can still offer those solutions together, and we're doing that for our customers. And we think that ultimately, that's the most compelling end-to-end offering in the market. We're also cross-selling into the existing relationships at one or the other companies. And as you know, BvD had a bigger European customer base, historically, RDC, a bigger U.S. customer base. So there's a very concerted sales effort there and lots of demand. And so we're building a pipeline for that. We've talked about out in the past, there's a myriad of use cases for all of the BvD and now RDC data and maybe give you an example of that. We're seeing more and more companies, and I'm talking about very large corporations who are looking to address financial crime and reputational risk concerns. This is basically trying to understand who they are doing business with, and it's not just the banking community.

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,69,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, Kevin. That's a great question. In fact, it's something that we, as a management team, have been quite focused on. Just because, obviously, this company went public recently with an IPO. They've been valued, I think the market capitalization is something like $6.5 billion. So I think it actually helps to illuminate the value of our ERS business. I think everybody in the call knows we've got a pretty similar SaaS-based software business that sells to financial institutions. But I would say, our business is a lot bigger. I mean, just looking at the numbers, if I recall right, we generated over $500 million in revenue in 2019. I think they were something under $100 million. And our strategy over the last few years has been to shift to more subscription-based revenue models. And that means that almost 80% of our revenue in ERS is recurring. And we've got, as you saw, very high retention rates given the business-critical nature of the software. So that our ERS business is really selling a broader range of solutions to a broader set of financial institutions, right, it's not just banking, it's also insurance, to help them make better decisions around credit and risk.",0.066868,0.982

It's a SaaS-based platform. It helps lenders by pulling together our datasets, our analytic tools, our software. And we have some common customers with nCino, but nCino is really focused more on end-to-end workflow.

I'd say it's still a relatively nascent market but certainly growing quickly. There's a lot of demand across the financial markets and certainly across our customer base. And we've talked about this before. We don't have the operating leverage that's afforded by the index business. You did hear that we are starting to partner with index businesses to provide them with the data. So that's a way for us to get access to the index space without actually owning an index business. So I think there, you would look for us to build our presence through partnerships and partnering with index players who don't own ESG businesses. We've done a few things here, and I think you'll see that a lot of this is organic. We're doing a lot of organic investment because we have the capabilities in-house. We bought some assets that bring some very valuable domain knowledge. We just recently appointed a new head of ESG and climate business internally. Before that, she was running all of our moodys.com business, a very big business for us. So it gives you a sense of how important we think this is.

I would say in the near term, we're probably in more of a holding pattern than we would have anticipated six to 12 months ago. We're still very satisfied with our joint venture investment in CCXI. CCXI continues to grow nicely and is the largest and most profitable of the domestic Chinese rating agencies. Clearly, the tension between the U.S. and China is not encouraging business activity between the two countries, is not encouraging favorable decisions on a whole range of things. And so what I think for the short term we're going to be doing is continuing to support CCXI, continuing to provide the range of services on the cross-border market and through Moody's Analytics that we're already providing, grow those businesses and wait for tensions to hopefully ease, which may not come until we get through the election, but then see how much the friction reduces and how quickly we can get back to thinking about other ways to expand the business in the domestic market.",0.969038,0.799

MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,84,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Sure. You're right. We've seen very strong issuance out of the public finance sector in the United States and actually the public finance sector around the world. And I think that's not surprising. A lot of issuers have used this as an opportunity to mitigate revenue shortfalls. So that's really been a catalyst for issuance and combined with the fact that you've got very conducive market conditions. And I think, ultimately, if the sector experiences further credit stress, the nature and amount of Fed and other stimulus programs is going to be very important in terms of mitigating the impact and thinking about market access. Obviously, to date, the Fed has rolled out the muni support program, and I think that runs through early next year, and that's been very important in terms of supporting investor confidence. The other thing is that ultra low rates have meant that the taxable financing market has been more favorable. And you might remember a couple of years ago, coming out of the Tax Reform Act of 2018, there were restrictions on the fundings. And that really reduced some of the volume in the public finance market in the subsequent quarters. But with rates being so low, taxable deals have now become more economic.

We are expecting incentive compensation to be approximately $40 million to $50 million per quarter for the remainder of 2020, and that would compare to the prior $25 million to $30 million we had previously guided given strong performance. On your point around unusual items, maybe I'll talk about this in the context of our outlook for the adjusted EPS result for the year. And we've guided at the midpoint to $9 primarily due to the reflection of the actual operating performance in MIS in the second quarter. And if I think about at $9, this is not necessarily an exhaustive list, but just a list of considerations for items that we have not adjusted for within that number. And that would include things like the prepayment penalty from the early calling of the June 2021 notes, the increased bad debt allowance for COVID-19-related exposures, the legal accrual or even things like the opportunity cost of forgoing share repurchases, at least on a temporary basis in the first and the second quarter.",0.6316188,0.801

And that is all reflected in the guidance that we've got today. So the other thing I might say is that just in general across the portfolio that the retention has been quite good. It's been a little bit better than we had expected back in the April earnings call. And our sales performance has been a little bit better than back in April as well. So both of those things have helped, not enough to change where we are in the guidance range, but that sales experience and retention has been pretty consistent across really most of the product line, and that includes ERS.

We've mentioned previously that we have evolved our selling approach, and we've adapted to meeting formats to be more virtual rather than in person. That naturally results in lower T&E and marketing costs. In addition, we've also been very active in reducing expenses through procurement activities, and as I mentioned a moment ago, through the use of, I'd say, lower cost locations for more routine operational activities. Structurally, we have taken a number of cost actions, including the 2018, 2019 restructuring program, which resulted in around $60 million of run rate savings this year. We also created an additional $30 million in efficiencies that we outlined back in February to support our 2020 operating income and investment back into the business. And if you take that together with the $5 million to $6 million in run rate real estate savings that we spoke about this morning in our earnings release, that creates an almost $100 million in ongoing savings from actions that the management team has taken.",1.5034039,0.946
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,110,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"If I specifically look towards our updated guidance for full year 2020 operating expenses of approximately flat, the comparison vis-à-vis 2019 shows around 1.5 to two percentage points related to ongoing expenses to support the company's initiatives to enhance technology infrastructure, to enable automation, innovation, efficiency, etc., and business growth. Probably 0.5 percentage point to acquired and divested companies or the net of, and then we get a small offset through a restructuring charge that doesn't reoccur quite to the same extent this year and FX.",0.4538578,0.856
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,111,Question,2020-07-30,2,2020,George Tong,Piper Jaffray,"Got it. That's helpful. And Mark, earlier on the call, you'd indicated that you would be revisiting share repurchases from time to time opportunistically. If you look at your share repurchase program or just capital allocation in general from a philosophical perspective, how has the pandemic changed your views from both the near-term and intermediate-term time frame?",,0.796
MCO-2020-Q2-2020-07-30,112,Answer,2020-07-30,2,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"I think maybe I'll give a little perspective, and I'll answer your question, George. I think from 2015 to 2019, free cash flow conversion of net income has been approximately 115%. That's adjusting for the 2017 DOJ settlement. We are expecting 2020 to be slightly above 100% despite what I think of as some working capital headwinds, like, for example, the higher 2019 incentive comp payments that came through in the first quarter this year, the retirement pension funding from the first quarter or even higher CapEx. And the growth in the 2020 free cash flow adjusting for some of those items is going to be greater than 10%, which is better than the full year adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. I'd say specifically to your question, we are a capital-light business. Investment would have to ramp up considerably in order to change the dynamic between adjusted net income and free cash flow over an extended period. And that's why I really wanted to focus our guidance around share repurchases again, really looking at it on a quarterly and an opportunistic basis as we have more clarity on the economic outlook.",0.015885,0.984

MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,6,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Thanks, Shivani. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm going to begin by providing a general update on the business, including Moody's first quarter 2021 financial results. And following my commentary, Mark Kaye will provide some further details on our first quarter 2021 performance as well as our revised 2021 outlook. And after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take any questions. Moody's delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2021, revenue growth of 24% and an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 49%, supported by strong performance from both Moody's Investor Service and Moody's Analytics. Improving economic fundamentals and increased M&A activity drove robust issuance in the first quarter, particularly in the leveraged loan and high-yield bond markets. MIS generated over $1 billion in revenue, and that was up 30% over the prior year period. MA's best-in-class subscription-based products and solutions drove revenue growth of 14% in the quarter. And amidst this growth, we're reinvesting back into our business by introducing new offerings, and integrating our recent acquisitions. As a result of our strong performance in the quarter, we've updated our full year 2021 guidance, and we now project Moody's revenue to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we've raised and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $11 to $11.30.",0.3744607,0.992
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,7,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now turning to first quarter results. This is the first time that MIS' revenue has exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter, while MA has delivered its 53rd consecutive quarter of growth. Moody's adjusted operating income rose 41% to $914 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 680 basis points to 57.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $4.06, again, up 49%. Now we could not have accomplished these great results without the hard work and dedication of our employees across the world. So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to express our appreciation and say thank you. I would also like to acknowledge the continued challenges faced by many of our employees across the globe due to ongoing pandemic conditions and especially our colleagues in India.",0.7213115,0.94
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,8,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now turning back to the first quarter. Issuance volumes reached their highest level in over a decade. While all sectors were active, leveraged finance was really the busiest of all asset classes with leveraged loans and high-yield bond issuance increasing by 94% and 85%, respectively. Now typically, it's unusual for both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds to experience this amount of growth in the same quarter. Issuers tend to favor one type of debt type over the other, depending on their outlook. But attractive refinancing opportunities as well as improving M&A activity supported both fixed and floating rate issuance this quarter. And additionally, CLO market rebounded from a quiet 2020 as issuers refinanced their existing securitizations to take advantage of tighter spreads.",0.2424504,0.971
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,9,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now the strength in the leveraged finance issuance in the first quarter stemmed primarily from an improving outlook for corporate defaults. In January, the global speculative-grade default rate was expected to end the year at just under 5%. And by early April, this outlook had improved to approximately 3% to 4%. That was due to a more positive economic backdrop. And these lower default expectations led to tighter credit spreads and keeping the overall cost of borrowing low despite an increase in benchmark rates, and this created an attractive environment for opportunistic refinancing and M&A-driven issuance. We're often asked about what informs our longer-term views of issuance. And we've shown a version of this graph on the slide before. In fact, I think I showed it in our 2018 Investor Day. And as you can see, the data shows that historically, GDP is one of the best predictive indicators of issuance over the longer term.",0.3205349,0.962
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,10,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"While this relationship may not hold in any one year, there is a clear correlation that issuance tracks GDP growth over time, and we expect this to remain true going forward. Now that makes intuitive sense as healthy economies promote business growth and capital investment and also provides a positive backdrop for our business over the medium term. Focusing on 2021, we still expect overall issuance to decline, albeit modestly from 2020's pandemic-related surge, and it will still be above the prior 5-year average. Investment-grade issuance, which grew the most in 2020 is expected to face the toughest comparable. However, with GDP expanding segments of the debt market most sensitive to improvements in the economy, like leveraged loans and structured finance are expected to show corresponding strength. And Mark will provide some further details on our issuance forecast by asset class later in the call.",0.4594478,0.976
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,11,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now moving to MA. We're driving robust organic growth across multiple products and solutions. Credit research and data feeds delivered low double-digit growth, driven by continued demand for ratings data feeds, coupled with strong retention rates. KYC and compliance is growing in line with our mid-20% expectations, and that's led by our compliance catalyst and supply chain solutions. And we're continuing to grow in insurance and asset management. In addition to our IFRS 17 offerings, we're expanding our footprint with the buy side, benefiting from the enhanced solutions suite that we obtained as part of our RiskFirst acquisition in 2019. In keeping with the theme of collaborating and modernizing and innovating that I discussed on the fourth quarter earnings call, I want to highlight a few recent examples that speak to how we're meeting our customers' evolving needs. Starting with ESG and climate. We're integrating ESG across all aspects of the business. In the first quarter, we launched a tool that provides climate-adjusted credit scores for approximately 37,000 public companies. In addition, building on our partnership with Euronext, our data powered the launch of their CAC 40 ESG index.",0.5815358,0.968
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,12,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"In MIS, our analysts are enhancing our ESG analysis with the launch of ESG scores and tools, and that includes our proprietary ESG credit impact score that identifies the impact of ESG factors on a credit rating. And our first batch of scores now cover the entire rated sovereign universe. On prior earnings calls, we've discussed how we're integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning and natural language processing into our products to make them better and faster. One example is QUIQspread. It's our automated financial spreading tool that's now used by scores of banks around the globe. This tool has helped customers substantially reduce both the time and cost spent spreading financial statements. And it's won multiple awards, including best AI Technology Initiative at the 2020 American Financial Technology Awards.",0.8912856,0.979
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,13,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Another area where we're using innovative technology is sentiment analysis and scoring capabilities. Our customers tell us they need our help with early warning indicators that filter the signal from the noise. We're delivering monitoring tools to analyze new stories to understand sentiment across thousands of media outlets, and we're seeing increased interest in this use case across our customer base. Our acquisition of Acquire Media has further enhanced our efforts in this space, and we'll touch on that more in a moment. In addition to innovating for our customers, we're modernizing our own technology infrastructure to deliver greater operational efficiency and agility. Just last week, we were proud to be recognized with an honorable mention in the Red Hat Innovation Awards for the open source platform and agile process that we implemented within the rating agency.",1.0319241,0.974
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,14,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now turning to our recent acquisitions. We're making some good progress integrating and leveraging the capabilities that we acquired to enhance our offerings. For example, we integrated information and screening capabilities into our KYC solutions, specifically within our flagship private company database known as Orbis. We're giving customers curated information on individuals and companies in one place and dramatically improving their ability to make better KYC decisions and saving countless hours in the process. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, the Acquire Media acquisition has accelerated our ability to generate scores that interpret the sentiment implied in news stories. We've already integrated the content from Acquire Media into multiple products.

MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,17,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thank you, Rob. In the first quarter, MIS achieved noteworthy results. Strong execution, robust credit activity and favorable issuance mix contributed to revenue growth of 30% compared to a 23% increase in global MIS rated issuance. Corporate Finance was the largest contributor, growing 34%, while issuance grew 37%. This is primarily driven by leveraged finance issuers, both opportunistically refinancing debt and funding M&A transactions. In contrast and in line with our expectations, investment-grade activity moderated as compared to the prior year period. The financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance lines of business also benefited from strong opportunistic refinancing led by infrequent issuers. Revenues in these sectors grew by approximately 30% year-over-year despite issuance growth in the single-digit percent range.",1.6456127,0.959
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,18,Remarks,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"In structed finance, revenue grew 21% as tighter spreads drove elevated CLO refinancing and new CMBS activity. MIS' adjusted operating margin expanded 720 basis points to 67.7%. This is enabled by strong revenue growth, coupled with ongoing cost efficiency initiatives and lower bad debt reserves, partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals. Moving to MA. First quarter revenue grew 14% or 10% on an organic basis. RD&A revenue rose 17% or 12% organically as KYC and compliance solutions delivered mid-20% organic growth. And customer retention rates remain high. ERS revenue growth of 5% or 4% on an organic basis led by a 15% increase in recurring revenue, driven by insurance products as well as credit assessment and loan origination solutions.",1.0491679,0.923

MA's adjusted operating margin expanded 360 basis points to 32.9%. Strong top line growth and execution of our in-flight restructuring program enabled additional operating leverage in the quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier in the call, Moody's adjusted diluted EPS grew by almost 50% to $4.06 primarily driven by our extraordinary performance in the quarter. Growth in operating income contributed approximately $0.94 to adjusted diluted EPS with $0.85 attributed to MIS. Additionally, nonoperating activities, including the resolution of uncertain tax positions as well as the release of associated accrued interest, provided a $0.28 benefit.",0.8804841,0.922

Moody's outlook for 2021 is based on assumptions regarding many geopolitical conditions, macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, responses by governments, regulators, businesses and individuals, as well as the effects on interest rates or in the currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market.

The US unemployment rate will decline to between 5% and 6% by year-end, and benchmark interest rates will remain low with US high-yield spreads remaining below approximately 450 basis points. Finally, the global high-yield default rate is predicted to decline to a range of 3% to 4% by year-end. Our guidance systems foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates, specifically our forecast for the remainder of 2021 reflects US exchange rates for the British pound of $1.38 and $1.18 for the euro.

As we strategically manage our expense base, we are maintaining our expectations for cost growth in the mid-single-digit percent range. Given our improved revenue outlook and expense ability, we project Moody's adjusted operating margin to be approximately 50%. Our updated net interest expense guidance is in the range of $160 million to $180 million, and we reaffirm the effective tax rate projection of 20% to 22%.

For a complete list of our guidance, please refer to Table 12 of our earnings release. Within MIS, we project full year global rated issuance to decline in the low single-digit percent range, up from our previous guidance of a high single-digit percent decline. Our guidance for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans has been raised to approximately flat and up 55%, respectively, as we expect robust issuance and leverage finance to persist into the second quarter, supported by low borrowing costs and sustained M&A activity. However, we anticipate supply to return to more normalized levels in the second half of 2021 as we believe many issuers will fulfill the majority of the fund needs earlier in the year.",1.2352496,0.912

We forecast issuance from financial institutions to be approximately flat. We have not factored the proposed U.S. infrastructure goal into our assumptions regarding public project and infrastructure finance issuance, which we anticipate will decline approximately 15%. Depending on the contents of the final legislation, if it were to pass, it could improve our expectations for the balance of the year. The expected increase in leverage loan supply positively impacts new CLO creation. As a result, we predict structured finance issuance will increase 40%. In line with the surge of leverage finance activity in the first quarter, we're increasing our guidance for new mandates in 2021 to be in the range of 800 to 850.",1.5627837,0.932

We now estimate that MIS' revenue will increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, up from our prior guidance of approximately flat. We're also raising MIS' adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 61%. For MA revenue, we are maintaining our forecast of an increase in the low double-digit percent range. This is due to strong demand for our subscription-based products, stable customer retention rates, favorable foreign exchange rates and a 2% to 3% percentage point tailwind from recent acquisitions.

First quarter came in a lot higher than what I was expecting, driven by MIS. But when I look at the guide for the full year, I guess the raise is a little bit lower than what I would have expected, just given the quarter. And I know we're going to comp the strongest quarter in 2Q. So are you just waiting for that to be behind you, or are you just -- are your expectations for the rest of the year lower now than they were, or are you just being conservative because I know we have a lot of positives ahead of us with strong GDP, et cetera. Thanks.",0.7931165,0.97
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,33,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Toni, we have increased our outlook for the full year 2021 adjusted EPS to approximately $11.15 at the midpoint of the guidance range, and that's around 6% higher than the guidance we gave on EPS back in February. The primary driver of that increase is really a reflection of the actual and the expected strong operating performance of MIS. And I'd call it around 6 percentage points. We all see small tailwinds of around 1% from some of the non-operating factors like the settlement of the outstanding tax matter, which is a little bit more favorable than expected, and that's offset in part by FX. We're certainly happy to go into the issuance outlook and our views there separately.",1.2204992,0.876
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,34,Question,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Okay. Great. And just as my follow-up, MIS margins were the highest ever, I believe, and not by an insignificant amount. You're guiding to 61% in the segment for the year. So having a hard time getting down to that level and after the 68 in 1Q. So just maybe help us drill down into the drivers of the lower margin for the rest of the year. Thanks.",0.873298,0.075
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,35,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"We are guiding, to your point, to approximately 61% for the MIS margin for the full year. And that really means, if you put the 67.7% in the context of that, that you would expect a year to go on average margin for MIS is somewhere between 57% and 58%. And that's primarily driven by our year-to-go expectation for issuance activity, which would be down in the low double digits, given our full year guide of low single-digits issuance. And then in turn, if I look at the underlying drivers, could be driven by tough comparables compared to the year ago period and pull forward that we saw in the first quarter, a little bit of the sorted pattern. And again, we're very happy to go into some of those drivers in more detail as the call goes on.",2.6210287,0.382

I wonder if you could give us just a little context on the insurance and commercial real estate opportunities, specifically within M&A.

Let me talk about each in turn here. So let's start with commercial real estate. It's really a major asset class for our financial institution and investor customers. And what we're hearing from customers is that they're looking for the integration of just a wide range of data and analytics to give them better insights and make better decisions, especially given all the underlying kind of turbulence in the market. So we acquired REIS a few years back to give us some market and property-level data that we could integrate into our offerings for our customers. And given the importance of that data to both lending and investing decision-making, we then bought Catalyst, and that helped us further build out our national property coverage. And we're -- by the way, we're very pleased with how Catalyst is -- and we're building out those data capabilities in new markets even a little bit faster than we had anticipated.",0.497843,-0.511

And they also want a more digitized and automated and really connected approach that reduces the underwriting time and enhances the borrower experience.

The core driver of that is around insurers seeking our solutions to help them with this IFRS 17 compliance.

That includes KYC, and I'm going to say even more broadly, financial crime, private company data, a lot of demand for private company data.

For my first question, I was hoping to take another stab at Toni's question. As you just look at the rest of the year following the first quarter, how did your outlook for quarters two to four compare to how you were thinking about quarters two to four when you gave guidance in February?",0.497843,0.723

Maybe I'll kind of start with issuance but that's an important foundational piece here.

MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,53,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So I think Toni acknowledged in her question that Q2 2020 was when we saw that huge surge of investment-grade infrastructure, sub-sovereign issuance.

And so if I think about attributing that to the approximately 50% guidance that we've given for the year, you could think about really 4 primary buckets. The first being operating leverage, which is positive creation of margin in the range of around 100 basis points and things like scalable revenue growth, the benefit of the incentive comp accrual resets, slightly lower new bad debt expense this time around, offset by the expectation of higher travel and entertainment expenses as we invest in further interactions with our customers of around offset in addition by acquisitions of around 50 bps as well.",1.1323752,0.844

You could see pull-forward even from -- depending on what happens with rates and spreads. You could see pull-forward from next year. Faster recovery and economic growth really outside of the U.S. could provide some upside. And then Mark touched on it, but potentially around infrastructure, depending on what kind of -- ultimately, what kind of bill we see, that might provide a boost to infrastructure issuance and municipal issuance in the back half of the year. On the downside, we've got to watch mix and any, kind of, escalation of a third wave of infections that ends up impacting the global markets. So that's really what's on our minds.",3.7230371,0.984

So maybe just if you haven't mentioned it yet, what was the incentive comp for the year? But then most importantly, how do you think about incentive comp for the remainder of the year? Because again, it does look like you had such a strong first quarter, but by my thinking, you probably under-accrued a little bit on incentive comp if the year continues to play out as we all expect.",1.1978064,0.952
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,85,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Alex, thanks for the question, and good morning. The incentive comp accrual process very simplistically that we follow is roughly 25% of the full year expected incentive comp payout, primarily because we're in the first quarter. So we're really looking at roughly one-quarter of the full year expected amount. In the first quarter itself, we accrued for a $61 million in incentive comp. And looking forward to the next three quarters, you would expect - or we expect to see around $60 million per quarter due to the improved full year revenue and margin outlook. That's slightly higher than what we had provided in February, which is a range for between $50 million and $60 million. So, certainly, we are incurring appropriately in the first quarter.",,0.422

The volume year-to-date for both of those categories has significantly surpassed the prior year period. And so the outlook that we're hearing from the banks here is that they expect the speculative-grade market to slow, as many issuers in east and their early perception of the year, have completed their refinancing needs in the first quarter.

So I want to go back to incentive comp and investments. I'm just wondering, the flexibility to accrue more incentive comp or maybe accelerate your investment in the first quarter given the strong revenue. I mean, if you accrue less in the first quarter, that would have more pressure on the expense base later this year, because you may have to true up the accrue comp. And then at the same time, office starts to reopen you may lose some of the co-fee sales. I am trying to understand, whether do you have the flexibility to change at 25% target, given that you expect revenue may moderate later this year?",1.3029501,0.794

So for incentive compensation, we typically followed a time-based percentage accrual process. That really is very much in alignment with the applicable SEC and accounting standards.

The first example could be in the commercial real estate space, where our customers are looking for on-demand scoring capabilities to screen properties globally.

Just touching on that point that Mark made, we're doing that in ESG, but this concept of integration is a place where we're making very deliberate investments, because as we integrate this, it's more useful for our customers, this concept of integrated risk assessment.

So, if I think about a combination of Acquire Media, ZM Financial, Catalyst, and Cortera total M&A spend there was around $350 million. That would have generated or we expected to generate in 2021, which is fully incorporated into our guidance around $44 million-ish in revenue collectively.

First, in terms of the balance sheet, cash continues to build. Leverage is well below what I think you'd consider a comfortable limit.

We know -- or at least is very aware that in early to mid-2020, we did pause buybacks.

That was mostly due to the purchasing plan that we put in place at the time we entered into the 10b5-1 plan used to purchase shares. And to the comment I made a minute ago, we're still continuing to target that $1.5 billion in share repu by the end of the year, and you should see an acceleration of the pace of that in the second quarter.",0.5313918,0.953

So I put this broadly in context, free cash flow actually grew faster than net income in both of 2019 and 2020.",1.0310136,0.949
MCO-2021-Q1-2021-04-28,158,Answer,2021-04-28,1,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Specifically in 2019, we had 8% versus 17% growth in free cash flow. And in 2020, we had 24% versus 27% growth in free cash flow. And so you can see sort of that variation a little bit across years. We are a capital-light business. Investment would have to ramp up really considerably to change that dynamic between net income and free cash flow over an extended period and we don't anticipate that necessarily happening.

I think you talked a little bit about the potential positive upside from the infrastructure proposals. And I know they're just proposals and we've got a long way to go. But if this does come to some sort of fruition, would it only impact the public finance aspect of your issuers? Could it bleed into other issuers?

Obviously, it's going to remain to be seeing kind of final size and content of whatever ends up getting passed. I would expect that the majority of that would be seen in our PPI sector possible that you can see some of that in our corporate finance sector.

MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,10,Remarks,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the first quarter, Moody's Analytics mid-teens revenue growth offset issuance headwinds resulting in a 1% revenue increase for Moody's Corporation as expected, Moody's adjusted operating margin contracted to 45.4% as the expense reductions from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 will not meaning meaningfully affect the P&L until the second half of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS nonetheless, grew by 2% year over year driven by a lower effective tax rate and a 1% reduction in share count from the accelerated share repurchase program. In the first quarter of 2019 lower interest rates and tighter fixed incomes spreads led to improved issuance activity following the disruption in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, issuance was lower than first quarter 2018 levels as a result of uncertain business outlook. The inversion of the U.S treasury yield curve and reduced global growth forecasts caused concern about economic weakness and contributed to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.",,0.832
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,11,Remarks,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Geopolitical concerns around U.S. China trade negotiations and Brexit uncertainty continued to weigh on the market. These factors lead to a mixed issuance environment in the first quarter. As I mentioned, while issuance improved significantly from the fourth quarter of 2018, year-over-year issuance was down 14%. MIS revenue was down only 7% demonstrating the continued strength of the business model. MIS's recurring revenue base supported by increased monitoring fees from recent new mandates as well as pricing, provided a partial counterbalance to the client initials. Similar to my comment on corporate expenses, we expect to start realizing MIS expense reductions from restructuring program as we move further into 2019. For the first quarter, the revenue contraction led to a decline in MIS's adjusted operating margin to 54.9%. However, focusing longer-term on a trailing 12-month basis, MIS margins were up 50-basis points to 57.5%.",,0.856
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,12,Remarks,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would like to spend another minute on investment grade and high-yield bond issuance as well as bank loan issuance in the first quarter as these were significant drivers of year-over-year performance. Due to the flattening of the yield curve in the first quarter, market preferences shifted from floating to fixed rate instruments while lowered financing costs, increased investment grade and high-yield bond issuance by 19% and 1% respectively.",,0.813
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,13,Remarks,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the other hand, higher financing costs reduced bank loan issuance by 33% year-over-year. While loan issuance for M&A activity remained relatively intact, refinancing activity was largely muted versus the prior year period. For MA, each business delivered double digit revenue growth, which contributed to 16% total MA revenue growth and a 350-basis point improvement in the adjusted operating margin. Organic MA revenue was up 13% from the prior year period. RD&A revenue grew 15% due to strong sales growth at Bureau van Dijk in the second half of 2018, contribution from the REE's acquisition as well as strength and core research and data products. On an organic basis, RD&A also delivered double digit revenue growth of 12%. In ERS strong fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter of 2019 subscription sales drove a 19% revenue increase and we continue to execute on the transition as we continue to execute on the transition to a Software as a Service or SaaS operating model. We're encouraged by this growth. However, we are not expecting increases of similar magnitude in every quarter. Professional services revenue growth of 13% was driven by the contribution from Omega performance as well as strong new sales in the mac's business. Organic professional services revenue was up 6%.",,0.991
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,14,Remarks,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would like to highlight the strong performance of ERS in the first quarter. The increase in the ERS revenue base which has grown by $100 million since 2015 has been a large driver of MA revenue.

Manav, we're really looking at areas of financial markets, where we think that they are underserved in the form of standards that help to understand measure and manage risk. So, certainly the interest in certain areas of ESG and cybersecurity are things that have drawn increasing attention from investors, from regulatory authorities and as a result are important, increasingly important for the issuer community and the MIS side and for a variety of institutions that Moody's Analytics serves. And we believe that as adjacencies to credit risk areas of ESG and cybersecurity are going to be folded into the overall financial analysis and investing that is done on a going forward basis.

Leverage ticked up a little bit in the first quarter really due to the lower first quarter adjusted operating income and some of our commercial paper borrowing.

When you look at the first quarter outside of the lower tax rate, I guess results in line with your expectations. And where I'm coming from is, I think top line you had sort of the week structured results, but that was offset by strong ERS, but margins were a little bit later than what I was thinking. And I know MIS was pressured by the revenue decline and it's just MA didn't really offset that.

So we can expand on that but I would say support and guidance we're still holding to our overall outlook for issuance of -- kind of flat to down 5%. And again, we can talk a little bit about that touching specifically on structure the first thing I would highlight is we had the reclassification of restructured into corporate finance. The big story structure this quarter was really around CLO's -- CLO formation -- new CLO formation held up pretty well generally in line with prior year quarter but it was really around the refi's and resets that we saw a significant decline in activity and that says we saw you know wider triple-A liability spreads and that really weakened the economics for CLO's. That said you know looking forward to structured finance, we -- the pipeline I would say is generally improving and I think that -- this includes CLO's. We've seen improvement in deal activity in CLO's each month of the quarter from a very slow start in January. We've seen CLO really pick up in March is continuing to be active into April.",,0.968
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,42,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,We have an active pipeline of CLO but that said that the refi and reset activity continues to be significantly below prior levels and any other you know kind of big piece of structure finances round CMBS and you know market activity was pretty good there in the first quarter.

Rob and I actually both can comment on this particular question. I'll first provide the perspective we're hearing externally from some of the banks and then I'll turn it over to Rob, who will follow up with our internal viewpoints. On the banking side in the U.S., banks primarily noticed the devilish faith commentary, still low yields and tightening spreads, which they believe is supported a strong start to the year for investment grade bonds and to a lesser extent high-yield bonds. While the tone from banks was quite positive on the start of the year, a concern does remain around potentially slowing economic growth in recession risk, which is I'd say briefly accentuated by the temporarily inversion of the yield curve. As a result, expectations are now for U.S. benchmark rates to remain lower for longer. This view on benchmarks rate is one of the factors that we believe or at least the banks believe contributed to a lowest U.S leverage loan issuance and a shift towards high-yield bond issuance.",,-0.573
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,46,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"If I turn to Europe and what we heard from the banks is that the investment grade market is seeing some of the right dynamics to U.S. investment grade. And you can see this in the tenured buns where the yield recently went negative half of the first time since mid-2016 and it's obviously currently hovering around the zero. Correspondingly, the banks are seeing a sharp decline in the number of investment grade floating rate issuances year today compared to the same period in 2018 and they raise favorable relative value dynamics that continue to encourage reverse yanky issuance as the bank's estimated around 30% of supply year-to-date has come from U.S. companies issuing in Europe. And then lastly, in the high-yield bond market issuance did stop the year slowed but so considerable pickup in March. And of course, Brexit remains a focus and a potential downside.",,0.178
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,47,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Mark Almeida,,"Maybe to add to that, Mark, I don't think we've seen a structural shift since we put together, certainly our views for the year in terms of how companies are thinking about financing. As I said, we're continuing to hold to that zero to down 5% that the biggest risk really to the current instruments outlook is probably around bank loans. Mark noted in regards to the street views and you have less opportunistic refi, the flattening of the yield curve and this issuer and an investor rotation out of bank loans and that's all contributing to the softness that we're seeing there. And I think we're going to need to see some further spread tightening to improve bank loan issuance volumes for the rest of the year.",,0.526
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,48,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Mark Almeida,,"So, we remain cautious on the bank loan space along with the decline in bank loans, softer outlook for CLOs. Again, record refi activity in 2018. And that's really begun to decelerate again, amidst these wider spreads that I talked about. I think some modest upside to our original outlook in investment grade and that's supported by opportunistic refinancing. Again, with rates coming in, spreads coming in and M&A activity as well. We continue to see very healthy M&A activity underpinning the market.",,0.786
MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,49,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Mark Almeida,,"We also see some upside to high yield and this is the flip side of the rotation from bank loans into high yield. And we're keeping an eye out on U.S. public finance. Again, we all know that was impacted from the tax law changes around the advanced refundings. As a result, first quarter of 2018 was a pretty modest comparable because we had pull forward into 4Q '17. So, that's an area where we have been expecting higher growth relative to the other higher issuance growth relative to the other sectors. And all-in-all, I think -- as I think forward to the just now, the next several months I think the risk from bank loans and CLS is probably modestly outweighing the outsides from U.S. investment grade and high yield.",,0.354

I think you gave it a lot of good detail on this whole move to more recurring. But maybe I missed this, but can you just talk about the first quarter and the near-term outlook here a little bit. Was there a bunch of one time-ish stuff that happened in the first quarter? Was it a little bit more transactional and maybe flesh out why? And I think about this business now is maybe growing consistently sequentially versus very seasonally as more assessments, I guess. my question is, is the second court a little bit of a sequential down tick?

MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,51,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Alex, it's Mark. The short answer to your question is no. The first quarter strength was really driven by very good results, on the subscription side of the business. So that really is what drove the 19% growth. And we just had very good strength across the business. All of the regions were up double digits. All of the product lines were up double digits. So, we did quite well across ERS in the first quarter. As ray said, we don't expect that the first quarter result is something that we'll be able to sustain through the full year. But we are expecting a strong year in ERS, particularly coming off of a down year last year because as we said at the end of last year, we feel like we've made the transition and we've turned the corner from being a predominantly SaaS-oriented or subscription-based business. And the runoff in the one-time business is now being offset by a very good strength and continued growth on the subscription side.",,0.982

I just remind everybody that the strategy behind ERS is that we use the ERS product to deliver Moody's analytics specialized data and analytical capabilities and we engineer platforms that address very specific customer problems. For example, we're working with many customers in the United States who need to adopt the CECL Accounting Standard that's, analytically rather complex. And it draws very directly on specific capabilities that we've got in Moody's analytics. And so, ERS has engineered a platform aimed directly at that customer problem. We've got a similar situation with insurers who are having to adopt the forthcoming IFRS '17 accounting standard, a similar story there more broadly. And we've worked with a lot of banks who are working hard to digitize and bring efficiency in their loan origination and credit assessment processes, particularly around lending to small and medium sized enterprises, our new credit lens platform is designed to enable that kind of digitization and efficiency.

MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,55,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Peter, on the margin, we feel good about the margin. We feel like we continue to make very good progress there. The first quarter was particularly strong. But we have not set a specific target or sort of a ceiling on where we think we can go with the margin. We continue to pursue expense management efforts as well as continue to drive growth in what is increasingly a subscription-oriented business. So, that implies lots of scalability. So, if we can drive good growth on the top line, we ought to be able to continue to add to our expanding margins. So, I think the first quarter we had a bit of a benefit from the elimination of that deferred revenue haircut in Bureau van Dijk last year. Frankly, that only accounted for about a third of the margin expansion that we're reporting. So, most of the margin expansion was coming from the rest of the Moody's Analytics business and a very significant chunk of that was from ERS. So, we're going to continue doing what we've been doing, which I think will allow us to continue on the path of consistent but gradual improvement in the margin from quarter-to-quarter. Again, the best way to look at that will be to look at it on a trailing 12 months basis because in any discreet quarter we're probably going to get some -- we can get some weird behavior either on the top line or on the expense line, but on a trailing 12 months basis, I think you'll continue to see good margin expansion in MA.",,0.983

People, the customers have indicated to us that they fully subscribed to and validate the hypothesis that we've had about the impact that we can have in bringing more insight and more analytic capabilities to the commercial real estate business. So, we're very encouraged by the response we're getting from customers. Having said that, there's still a lot of work for us to do there, but we feel very good about the path we're on and the opportunities to grow that business.",,0.953

I think some of the shifts that we've made in business model, particularly in ERS and also to some degree, in our training business is definitely enabling us to deliver much more scalable and therefore profitable solutions.

Maybe you could give us a cadence there. And I'm just wondering, should we think of this as guidance on the margin side?

That we see an uptick in issuance, particularly if its issuance from institutions that we already have a rating relationship with, that's going to be a margin friendly scenario. We've talked about on previous calls a little bit, about the desirability of the new mandates because they create new relationships which benefit us in the going forward years.

Issuance excluding for the overall market issuance, excluding sovereign debt was down about 14%. MIS revenue was down about 7%. That would seem to be some notable outperformance there.

In terms of the commercial opportunity, it's only days. We will have to see how much the increasing investor in customer interest in ESG translates into a robust commercial opportunity. And we'll obviously keep you informed as we move forward with that. The level of interest though in ESG, cyber security, cyber scoring is very high. And it's particularly high in Europe. And it's growing everywhere.

I would say for us there's a standalone commercial opportunity as Ray described, but it's also increasingly relevant to the work that we're doing in the rating agency and also brought more broadly across [indiscernible] customer base.

MCO-2019-Q1-2019-04-24,72,Answer,2019-04-24,1,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think as we've talked about on previous calls, we do have a joint venture in China, entity called CCXI. It is the largest rating agency in China. It has been the most successful a rating agency I think both in terms of its coverage and financially. So, we are very interested in continuing with that joint venture relationship. What that translates into in terms of having a separate license for Moody's to operate in the domestic market, I think is uncertain at this point. It may be that the Chinese would prefer us to operate either through CCXI or on our own as a Moody's. And we will just have to see as their thinking evolves, we make our views as clear as we can, but we are very interested in staying with the joint venture and that would influence how we think about the domestic market opportunity. Now, that being said, we still have very good coverage in the cross-border markets for Chinese institutions that are active internationally. We expect that to continue. And we've had a good growth in that stock of rating relationships. So, that's all continuing as it has been. And I guess just the last thing I would add is one of the attractions of the joint venture is that it is actually licensed top rate in both the interbank market and the exchange traded market. And so, the interbank market being larger, the exchange traded market being the faster growing market. And that makes that platform, again, particularly attractive to us.",,0.991

I think rather than what our preference is, it's probably best to look at this through the lens of what the priorities are for the Chinese policy makers in terms of their thinking about how they would like to see participation in their market and what the nature of that participation would be. Certainly, they don't want to see disruptive activities with respect to their market.

And in attracting foreign capital, they are certainly aware of the fact that international investors interested in deploying capital into China would be interested in hearing from international institutions such as Moody's about risk and related research.

The most prominent factors in the expense growth that we saw this quarter and we're related to hiring and merits, and this is primarily due to the impact of hiring in prior periods. Now obviously we've spoken about our ability and our desire to continue to invest selectively in lower cost location. I'd also note that the expense growth is due to the inorganic activity from REE's and Omega, and then certainly our restructuring charge. Now thinking forward, we are not expecting a significant ramping in expenses from the first to the fourth quarter, and specifically as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program. If I have to quantify that I'd say expenses with ram somewhere between -- somewhere around $10 million in the first of the fourth quarter, and I don't think this will necessarily be linearly -- and just by the way of comparison last year's expense ramp was $15 million, so there is a meaningful reduction this year.",,0.956

And we did communicate the time that we announced our restructuring program that we would begin to see those savings emerge really in the second half of the year. And that's because the restructuring savings encompasses really three areas of those real estate management, a second relates to people, and third really relates to ongoing oversight of various projects and initiatives.We are on-track I would say to achieve the total restructuring plan target that we have updated earlier in the year and that would lead to an anticipated annualized pretax saving amount of $40 million to $50 million.And I would say that we do expect a larger Q2 restructuring charge to be booked as vis-à-vis what we see now in Q1 and that may push us to be slightly above the high-end of the previously communicated $70 million to $80 million range.",,0.586

Is it simply that I guess the savings from that restructuring charge or is there any change as we think about the ongoing hiring and pace of investment across the year.

Moody's adjusted operating income of $531 million was down 5% from the prior year period. Solid revenue growth in the quarter was outpaced by increased operating expenses, including non-recurring items such as severance and incentive compensation.

This was primarily the result of strong contributions from both U.S. leveraged loans and speculative grade bonds as issuers continue to opportunistically refinance debt and support M&A deals. Revenue from public project and infrastructure finance declined 3% against a 12% increase in U.S. public finance activity, as many issuers addressed refunding needs earlier in the year to avoid potential election-related volatility.",1.1342663,0.833

This is primarily due to lower CMBS activity, despite signs of improvement in CLO. In the fourth quarter first time mandates grew 32%. For the full year we received approximately 700 new mandates. MIS expense growth included non-recurring costs such as severance related to business efficiency initiatives and incentive compensation accruals associated with strong full year performance. Consequently, expense growth outweighed revenue expansion for the quarter, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 48.3%.

Generally, you guys have done great with margin expansion over time. And yet here we have a year coming up where margins are going to be a little bit more constrained. So how do you think about that balance, driving margin expansion using top-line growth that you will have in 2021, especially in MA, coupled with the need to continue to reinvestment further?",0.8502269,0.986
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,63,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thank you very much for the question. This is Mark here. We are constantly pushing to increase margin, while ensuring to your point that we are balancing that against the need to invest in the business to maintain and accelerate top-line growth. As we noted in the prepared remarks, there are a number of exciting investment opportunities that we've identified for 2021. And we're going to take advantage of those while preserving the margin at approximately 49% to 50% for the year, after having and we spoke about this expanded the margin by 230 basis points in 2020.",0.5234493,0.637
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,64,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"I gave a little bit more color in terms of how that's broken down, that might also be helpful. If we think about creation of margin in 2021 through operating leverage, that's probably 50 to 100 basis points and that's going to come from things like scalable revenue growth, a little bit of a benefit from the reset of an incentive compensation accrual. If I think about even creation of additional margin from savings and efficiency, that's probably between 140 and maybe 180 basis points to the positive and that's going to come from things like our restructuring program, which we can speak about later in the call increased automation, utilization of lower cost, location, procurement efficiencies, real estate, efficiencies, et cetera. And those positive margin creations are going to be offset and by organic investments that we're going to be making back into the business. And we spoke last quarter about that 80 million to 100 million that we're going to be reinvesting into key strategic areas, which we can talk about further on the call if you would like.",,0.0

And then of course, there's that math element in terms of business mix, where MA is forecast to grow faster than MIS in 2021 and that's probably a headwind of around 25 basis points. So if you put that all together, you get a sense of how we're managing the portfolio of businesses to ensure continued margin expansion while we invest in growth in the future.",0.4848714,0.862

MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,68,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So maybe let me talk to you a little bit about the 2021 issuance outlook. And now, as I said back in October, we still think issuance is going to be down modestly year-over-year, and we're guiding down in the high single-digit percent range. And I would say, while we expect some very robust issuance activity to continue, we've got some favorable market conditions. The challenges that the year-over-year growth is, we've got some very tough comparables after two very strong issuance years between last year and year before. So our outlook assumes that these constructive market conditions continue largely for 2021, widespread distribution of a vaccine and improving economic growth. Certainly, we're seeing continued recovery in M&A activity and we're seeing a lot of now sponsor driven activity and sustained central bank support and potentially another round of stimulus. And all that, I think will be underpinned by a continued low rate environment that's going to be supporting of refinancing.",0.3753236,0.363

That's just a very tough comparable. That said, our outlook for 2021 investment grade would still be one of the strongest years on record.

What we're really looking for are things that are going to advance our strategy. And I laid that out in my prepared remarks and Cortera is an interesting example.

We'll see the majority of growth is likely to be driven throughout RD&A segments. Rob spoke earlier, we spoken part of the prepared remarks around ERS and the ongoing transmission of that business towards more of a recurring revenue basis. That will offset some of the declining one-time sales in the ERS space.

On our efficiency programs, three percentage points of that would relate to sort of incentive stock and commissions on strong sales performance.

M&A is a wildcard we've expected M&A activity to pick up to what looks more like, levels that we've seen in kind of 2018, 2019. But it's possible that we could see, M&A activity go beyond that.

The first category is really that savings and efficiency, the 80 million to 100 million that we anticipate and creating, that's probably 3% to 3.5% of that expense base.

And I guess I would say kind of looking the other way, that in theory, the tax shield is going to be increased. But we, it could also be limiting, to some extent the free cash flow of issuers. But I think, in general I would expect this to be pretty modest. I mean, they're talking about a 28% rate that's still lower than where the tax rate was, before any of this change.

And so the real promise of RDC was to be able to put all that together for our customers and that then allows us to be competitive in our process where there are other parties that are looking at these assets. Certainly other companies are investing in anti-financial crime and know your customer because it is very high-growth space, attractive place to be. So that industrial logic allows us to be not only be the ultimate owner, but also to meet our acquisition criteria at the same time.",0.6307161,0.366
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,169,Question,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"And then just following up on ERS, I just want to make sure I understand this right. There is some fantastic growth in the recurring revenue line. But you're effectively winding down the sort of one-time transactional side of that business. So I just wanted to make sure I understood sort of how -- I guess how long that sort of wind-down should last and when we should start to see that really strong growth from the recurring side flows through more optically?",0.4361519,0.768
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,170,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Through the total revenue line. Yes. And, Simon, you've got it exactly right. Mark touched on it earlier. We've got low double-digit recurring revenue growth. That is the focus for us. It's building up the recurring revenue, the subscription part of the business and as you saw in the fourth quarter that was almost fully offset by that decline in one-time sales.",0.7679034,0.823
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,171,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now, we had talked about one-time sales being soft back in 2020. We also had a very tough comp on one-time sales. But the reality is, I'm not sure I'd say winding down, but I would say de-emphasizing. There are some customers who still only want an offering through a licensed solution and in that case, we're probably going to sell it to them. But our real focus is on recurring revenue.",0.6578947,0.93
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,172,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,So we are kind of pushing through right now where you're seeing the overall top-line is a little bit soft relative to what it's been historically but that recurring revenue line is very strong. And what Simon maybe to give you also just a little bit of insights into what is driving that low double-digit revenue growth for recurring revenue. There are really three main things I would say.,0.2761001,-0.128
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,173,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"One is insurers, they're seeking our help in getting compliant. You've heard us talking about IFRS 17 regulatory requirement. That stuff is very computationally demanding. And some of you may remember, we bought a company called GGY a few years ago. And the GGY product suite, along with our own internal product development has really set us up nicely to capture the demand there. So we're not only just adding new customers, but we're building new modules, we're adding analytic capabilities and we're deepening our penetration with the existing insurance customer base. That's a great story.",0.3511648,0.077
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,174,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Second, we've got ongoing demand from U.S. financial institutions to comply with the credit loss reporting requirements. And then third, you've heard us talk about credit lends, right, our commercial lending application in the past. Again, we're deepening our penetration with our existing bank customers. We're adding modules and capabilities that they need. This is another land and expand story and a great example that we launched an automated spreading tool called QUIQspread that came out of our accelerator. It's really an employee-driven innovation that worked its way through the accelerator and that's now -- we're selling that alongside credit lends and it's in use at over 40 global banks.",0.9145815,0.893
MCO-2020-Q4-2021-02-12,175,Answer,2021-02-12,4,2020,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So that's what's driving the demand. And as you said, we're going to continue to have some headwinds. I don't know exactly how long that's going to be. I would imagine in the next couple of years as that as that one-time line continues to decline.",1.5660052,0.361

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,9,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Moody's delivered robust financial results in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue of $1.5 billion grew 13% due to strong customer demand for our mission-critical products and insights. In both operating segments, revenue increased in the double-digit percent range. For MIS, attractive market conditions continue to drive opportunistic refinancing and M&A activity for leveraged loans and structured finance issuance. Meanwhile, MA experienced strong growth across our subscription-based products, which now comprise 93% of total MA revenue on a trailing 12-month basis.",0.5012942,0.933
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,10,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"We remain focused on delivering our integrated risk assessment strategy through innovation and investment in high-growth markets, and I'll spotlight a few examples later in the call. As a result of our strong third quarter performance, we've revised our full year 2021 guidance and now forecast Moody's revenue to grow in the low teens percent range. Additionally, we've raised and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $12.15 to $12.35, which, at the midpoint of $12.25, represents an approximate 21% annual growth rate.",0.0754961,0.785
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,11,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"In the third quarter, MIS revenue was up 12% from the prior year and MA revenue was up 13%. Organic MA revenue increased 8%. Moody's adjusted operating income rose 2% to $737 million. During the third quarter, expense growth was higher than revenue as we invested significantly in our capabilities and product development in order to better serve a number of high-growth use cases. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.69, flat to the prior year period, and Mark will provide some additional details on our financials shortly.",0.4266609,0.785
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,12,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Favorable market conditions led to the strongest third quarter in over a decade in terms of both MIS revenue and rated issuance. Leveraged loan issuance was very strong, supported by low default rates and robust private equity activity and investor appetite for floating rate debt amid higher inflation and rising interest rate expectations. As we anticipated in our prior guidance, investment-grade supply moderated given the tough prior year comparable. However, volumes were still substantial and remained above the 10-year historical average for MIS-rated debt.",0.1548749,0.895
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,13,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Additionally, after a muted 2020, structured finance issuance reverted back to levels seen in 2017 and '18. Ongoing favorable market conditions, including tight spreads, drove both CLO refinancing activity and new CLO creation as well as new CMBS and RMBS issuance. As you can see on the chart on the left, tight credit spreads combined with low default rates created an attractive environment for opportunistic refinancing and M&A activity in the third quarter. The U.S. default rate is forecast to fall below 2% by year-end. That's a significant reduction from a pandemic high of nearly 9%. And while the uses of proceeds were weighted towards refinancing earlier in the year, heightened M&A activity continued in the third quarter as issuers used acquisitions to support growth.",0.5737705,0.949
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,14,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"We frequently comment on our views on long-term issuance drivers, which include GDP growth, ongoing disintermediation trends and upcoming refinancing needs. Based on our annual research published by Moody's Investors Service earlier this month, refunding walls over the next 4 years for U.S. and European issuers have increased 9% to approximately $4.1 trillion. Investment-grade supply remains the biggest asset class despite the recent surge in leveraged loans. This is slightly above the historical compound annual growth rate and is supported by 19% growth in U.S. leveraged loan forward maturities and 7% growth in U.S. investment-grade forward maturities, providing a solid underpinning for medium-term issuance.",0.4184642,0.942
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,15,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Now moving to Moody's Analytics. MA's recurring revenue grew 18% in the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, now represents 93% of total MA revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. This is supported by new customer demand and strong retention rates, which is really a testament to the mission-critical nature of our product suite. The chart on the right illustrates the strong organic recurring revenue growth on a trailing 12-month basis across some of our key operating units. Each of these businesses currently represent at least $100 million of annual revenue with growth rates above 10% versus the prior year.",0.0379638,0.912
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,16,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Starting with credit research and data feeds. Recurring revenue improved in the low double-digit percent range through a combination of increased yields and sales to new and existing customers. Recurring revenue in banking solutions within the ERS business grew at a similar pace as customers continue to leverage our products to support a wide range of functions, everything from lending to portfolio management and accounting and reporting requirements. Recurring revenue for our insurance and asset management business within ERS increased in the mid-20s percent range and was driven by ongoing demand for our actuarial modeling and IFRS 17 solutions. And finally, KYC and compliance built on its strong start to the year, also growing in the mid-20s percent range. This continues to be an important growth driver for Moody's that I'll expand on further.",0.3295945,0.971
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,17,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Last quarter, I summarized a few key trends underpinning growth in the KYC market. And I described how our differentiated offerings are driving organic growth rates north of 20%. And let me give you a few examples that illustrate the value that we provide across a variety of customer applications. In banking, one of our core use cases is to support customer due diligence requirements by providing transparency into counterparty relationships and beneficial ownership structures. And the accuracy, quality and linkage of our data enables us to be a trusted partner with banks in complying with the regulatory requirements and managing reputational risk across the financial sector.",0.7454702,0.922
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,18,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Turning to a large automotive leasing company. They previously relied on manual processes but now have automated their supplier due diligence activities by using our Orbis database to onboard and monitor tens of thousands of suppliers and their beneficial owners. And last, a worldwide transportation company was looking for an integrated supplier of risk solution to comply with anti-bribery and corruption laws and automate the risk assessment procedures. They chose our Compliance Catalyst solution to help them onboard and monitor almost 20,000 suppliers, primarily because it provided them with a single tool from which to source high-quality compliance, financial and ESG data.",0.0724763,0.84
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,19,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Last month, we closed on the RMS acquisition. We're very excited to welcome our new colleagues to Moody's. And our teams have begun to work to jointly advance our integration plans. Recently, I had the opportunity to spend a couple of days together with the MA and RMS management teams to get to know each other and to align on priorities. And it's clearly a great cultural fit. And we see interesting opportunities across our combined life and P&C businesses, potential for new solutions that empower integrated risk assessment and an opportunity to sync and upgrade our technology platforms.",0.0198447,0.974
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,20,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"We're focused on 3 key areas to drive incremental revenues and achieve our targets. First is cross-selling to our respective customers. And we've already begun conducting joint customer meetings to start to identify opportunities. And I have to say, the dialogues are encouraging. Second is the transition of RMS customers to their new SaaS platform, where RMS will benefit from MA's recent experience and which represents an opportunity for some revenue uplift. And third is new product development and integration. When I was with the team, they identified a wide range of opportunities, from simple integration to enhance our insurance analytics, to new products serving new customer segments. In fact, we have a team working specifically on identifying opportunities for corporates and governments across climate and cyber. So our work with RMS has begun and we're looking forward to the future together.",0.0461605,0.966

That new module enhances our award-winning models and covers 40,000 public companies and millions of private firms.

For example, as part of our Data Alliance consortia, we recently released our first set of CECL dashboards. And that enables banks to benchmark themselves against their peers and enhances the value of our product. And we're integrating commercial property data and cash flow analytics into our CreditLens suite of solutions to help commercial real estate lenders make better decisions.

And to help our customers understand this evolving risk, we made a significant investment in BitSight, a leader in cybersecurity ratings space.

And this is evident in the way that climate considerations are embedded across our company. Within our products, we offer market participants the tools they need to better identify, measure and manage climate resilience. We've developed a comprehensive suite of climate risk data, scores and insights to measure physical exposure to climate hazards, to analyze the company's transition risk and also to understand how climate risk translates into credit risk. And the addition of RMS will meaningfully enhance the quality of our offerings to help deliver world-class analytics to the market.",0.4547023,0.681

We brought forward our commitment to achieve net zero across our operations and value chain to 2040, and that's 10 years earlier than our original target. Additionally, we're very proud to have achieved recognition as a 2021 Global Compact LEAD company, a major distinction from the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. And as founding member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, we're committed to align all of our relevant products and services to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,28,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thank you very much, Rob. In the third quarter, MIS revenue and rated issuance increased 12% and 11%, respectively, on elevated leveraged loan and CLO activity. Corporate finance revenue grew 6% compared to a 2% increase in issuance. Heightened demand continued for leveraged loans as issuers opportunistically refinanced debt and funded M&A transactions. Additionally, we observed lighter investment-grade activity compared to the record levels in the prior year period as well as a decline in high-yield bonds as investors pivoted to floating rate debt.",0.0083207,0.232

Transaction revenue was up 24% as infrequent bank and insurance issuers took advantage of the attractive rate and spread environment. Revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance declined 2% compared to a 17% decrease in issuance as U.S. public finance issuers largely fulfilled their funding needs in prior periods.",0.362708,0.891
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,30,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Structured finance revenue was up 63%, supported by strong recovery in issuance. While this was primarily attributable to CLO refinancing activity, the third quarter also had a high level of new deals driven by a surge in leveraged loan supply. In addition, CMBS and RMBS formation further bolstered overall results.",0.4201967,0.681

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,32,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,Moving to MA. Third quarter revenue rose 13% or 8% on an organic basis. Ongoing demand for our KYC and compliance solutions as well as data feed drove a 15% increase in RD&A revenue or 12% organically. This was further supported by mid-90s percent retention rate and robust renewal yield for our credit research and data products. ERS revenue rose 8% in the quarter. Organic recurring revenue grew 13% driven by customer demand for our banking products as well as insurance analytics solutions. This was more than offset by an expected decline in onetime revenue and led to a 2% decrease in overall organic revenue.,0.128593,0.904
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,33,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"As a result of our strategic shift towards SaaS-based solutions, recurring revenue comprised 90% of total ERS revenue in the third quarter, up 12 percentage points from the prior year period.

Moody's outlook for 2021 is based on assumptions regarding many geopolitical conditions, macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; responses by governments, regulators, businesses and individuals as well as the effects on interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market.

Benchmark interest rates will gradually rise, with U.S. high-yield spreads remaining below approximately 500 basis points.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,36,Remarks,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Our guidance also assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.

I'm going to start kind of big picture with RMS because I think that will be useful to everybody on the call, and then we'll get Mark to drill down into some of the numbers. And I want to say that while we've owned RMS for less than 45 days, I think we're very excited about the prospects of what we can do together. And one thing that we found is that RMS, the combination of RMS and Moody's has made us a very important vendor to the largest insurance companies in the world.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,51,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"And we've got a plan to integrate RMS that's really focused around 4 key pillars. First is go-to-market strategies really in our insurance business, including cross-sell. Second is a road map for integrating RMS' capabilities across Moody's.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,52,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"But to give you a sense of the cross-selling opportunity, in the core insurance space, less than 10% of our combined total insurance customers are currently served by both Moody's and RMS. So there's a lot we think we can do there. Let me give you a couple of examples, Manav, of where we see some relatively low-hanging fruit in terms of cross-selling and product integration in the insurance space.",0.1384814,0.848
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,53,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"RMS has got something called LifeRisks and that focuses on a mortality and longevity solution. And we think we're going to be able to integrate that into our life insurance actuarial modeling platform and sell that to our life insurance customers. And think about RMS, they essentially had 0 sales effort into life insurance. So that's going to be a great opportunity for us to take that to several hundred life insurers.",0.5129422,0.491
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,54,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,Another place is in our asset and capital modeling solution that's available for life insurers and integrating that into RMS' Risk Intelligence platform serving P&C companies. So there are a number of other things that we've identified but that gives you a flavor for it. And then we're looking at leveraging RMS' capabilities to serve new customer segments in new ways.

The first was increased transaction-related expenses of around $22 million. Second was a higher expected deferred revenue haircut in 2021 of $18 million.

So we are guiding to a full year 2021 MIS adjusted operating margin outlook of approximately 62%. And that really means if you back into the fourth quarter of the year ago margin, we're looking at roughly 54.5%.

I understand given you haven't given us any sort of look yet, but it is November and clearly, everybody's kind of already moved on focusing on next year.

I knew I was going to get this question. And I realize I'm probably going to sound a little bit like a broken record. So let me just give you some insight into how we're thinking about it.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,68,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"But I think fundamentally, while the conditions are very, very conducive to issuance right now, and you noted it in your question, we have to take into account the very robust issuance environment we've had over the last, now, 2 years.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,69,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So in terms of tailwinds, certainly, we've got a rebound in economic activity. We've always said that, that is good for our business. And assumption, our assumption is that inflation will, in fact, be transitory. And we've got a, we assume there's going to be a continuation of the very strong pace of M&A that's going on right now. And I think that's going to be particularly true in the case of sponsor-driven LBO activity. We've got private equity funds that just have huge amounts of money to deploy.",0.4236411,0.153

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,71,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"And then I guess I would also add that we're going to see a continued uptick in sustainability-focused financing. That's going to grow dramatically next year, although that may be a little bit more of an issue of mix than volume. Now in terms of headwinds, it really does start with just the comps. And obviously, last year, it was investment-grade. This year, it is leveraged loans.",0.0875755,0.835
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,72,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So the outlook for leveraged loans, the sustainability of issuance in leveraged loans and in turn CLOs is going to be very important, I think, ultimately to our outlook. And like I said, there are some very good drivers for leveraged loan volumes to continue, M&A, gradually rising rate environment. Mark noted, we expect issuance to be up over 100% versus last year.

But as we think about the years ahead, that's why we wanted to highlight the 4-year forward maturities. They've grown at a rate of about 9% versus last year.

I know you talk about ESG and climate increasingly. I think still pretty early in terms of revenues.

Let me go ahead and maybe do a little bit of a holistic perspective, and I'll dive right in to specific areas that we're having success and sort of where our competitive advantage is here. Overall, the market itself is really coalescing around what we think of as 2 really important ESG themes. The first is really consistency, and that's really the need for more commonization and standardization. And the second is really around integration, right?

And with that, let me highlight sort of those 3 customer examples to a part of your question. The first is in the CRE space where our customers want on-demand scoring capabilities to screen properties globally. And they want sustainability considerations to be integrated into that screening. And so we've developed a solution that provides those forward-looking risk assessments, property exposures to floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other climate hazards over time.

They're looking for climate data really to be integrated into economic scenario modeling and stress testing to really help them meet regulatory and other requirements. They also need it integrated into how they're assessing risk across their wholesale banking credit portfolios. And so we are doing that. We're helping to integrate those climate and ESG factors into our model.

Alex, you think about where do we think we have source of competitive advantage, you're right, it's a crowded field. I'll give you one example. We've developed what we call an ESG Score Predictor that's got scores on 140 million companies. Nobody else has that kind of coverage and we're leveraging that Orbis database that we have.

And to give you a sense, Ashish, of the kind of scale of operations in our KYC business, we're now processing more than 700 million screens a day. So we're now building on this position. We've confirmed at least 10, what we call, innovation partners, which represent a range of well-known financial institutions, technology companies and corporates who we are now working with to co-create and shape industry-leading solutions.",0.4219154,0.891

We're going to keep investing inorganically to make sure we've got a leading position in what is a very attractive market. And then to touch on the last part of your question, how is ESG integrating. You think about, we call it know your customer. But increasingly, this is know your counterparty, know your customer, know your supplier. And as I said, it's going beyond, I need to understand whether they're on a sanctions list, so I now want to understand, are they on a sanctions list? Is there reputational risk? Does this company have the same kind of ESG profile that I want to do business with? Is my data secure with them? And so we're seeing, as part of this know your counterparty space, a desire from customers to start integrating more and more content to give them a more 360-degree view of who they're connecting to.

And they need more transparency and more global comparability. That's what international investors want.

First of all, it's going to provide very wide coverage. So the platform is going to cover the top 1,000-plus Chinese corporates. And it will have global comparability. That's something else that's very important, standardized financials, credit metrics and model implied ratings on a global scale because that then allows for pure comparison globally, which is very important across both MIS-rated and kind of model-rated firms. It's going to provide transparency and some in-depth analysis with financial statement quality scores and interactive scorecards.

And to give you a sense, by year-end, our event activity covering Greater China will be up over 20% from last year. We'll have done 160 events. And we're increasingly really working under a One Moody's banner. A great example of that is our Moody's ESG China series. We're innovating in terms of our local delivery there.

We're going to be upgrading and delivering more of a true digital experience that is going to enable our RD&A users to consume, really CreditView users, to consume content where, when and how they want it.

We've got the bubble chart that shows you. You've got a number of businesses doing more than $100 million in revenue.

For the full year 2021, we're looking to invest approximately $110 million. And just to give you a feel because this obviously ties back with the expense calendarization by quarter, we spent approximately $30 million in the third quarter and we're looking at somewhere between $45 million and $50 million in the fourth quarter.

Obviously, that's the integration of the acquisitions from RDC, Cortera and Acquire Media. And that's all about best-in-class KYC and financial crime prevention. I just wanted to make a note here. We have a really great customer feedback on our new insights around human trafficking alerts and some of the identity verification. On CRE briefly, it's around streamlining our customers' workflow for lending, investment and monitoring. ESG, I think we've sufficiently spoken about.

I mean, obviously, there's been a nice uptick in structured finance to offset some of the corporate finance weakness. But if I go back, you're still kind of 40% below the '07, '08 peak in structured finance, right, if you look at your revenue, yet kind of corporate finance is 5x what it was. Do you have any thoughts as to structured finance revisit that prior peak? I know the dynamics are a little bit different, but any thoughts as to does that continue to offset maybe some of the uptick in rates?

I guess the first thing that comes to mind here is just, when we're talking about 2007, if we went back and looked at the size of the RMBS market, that's going to be a very big piece of that, that just has not come back to anything like what it looked like pre-global financial crisis. And we get asked from time to time, do we think it will and there have been some proposals around the GSEs and other things.

Obviously, CLOs is, you saw our guidance, up 100%. But ABS, very tight spreads in that market, improving consumer confidence. You've got CMBS, which has been surprisingly resilient coming out of the pandemic and of course, CLOs.

On MA specifically, we are guiding to approximately 29% for the full year. And that means the implied fourth quarter MA margin is approximately 24%. And that is down from last year's result of 28.4%.

They've got over 2,000 customers that use their insights for a wide range of use cases. So this will give you a sense. I mean, it's everything from insurance companies that are underwriting cyber insurance and want better visibility into the risk of what they're underwriting, corporates who've got and managing supply chain and vendors, corporates who are doing own security assessment and benchmarking, M&A due diligence, national cybersecurity and the list goes on.",0.3830889,0.539

And we're now expecting incentive compensation to be between $325 million and $330 million for the full year.

But can you touch on the other industries out there? This seems like a huge opportunity long term to sell those capabilities into other areas outside of insurance. That's my first one.",2.5578085,-0.778
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,137,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. That's exactly right, Craig. So you think about RMS for 30 years has been supporting the insurance industry in underwriting weather risk, call it climate risk, weather risk, right, among other kinds of risk as well. They've obviously developed models beyond extreme weather events. But I think what we're all realizing is that weather risk and the physical risks related to climate change are no longer just the insurance industry's problem.",0.2588438,-0.363
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,138,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"In fact, the insurance industry is going to be very thoughtful about what they insure on an ongoing basis, right? So you can imagine you're a bank, you've underwritten a 10-year loan and during the life of that loan, an insurance company decides they're no longer going to insure the collateral because they're concerned about the climate risk. And all of a sudden, the bank then inherits the climate risk. You've got, I think, a broad understanding now of the impact of weather. There's a whole range of knock-on impacts.",0.8559103,0.329
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,139,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"I'll give you an interesting data point, Craig. Over the last 30 years, there have been something like $400 billion of insured losses related to weather events, but there have been something like $1.3 trillion of uninsured, right? So this is flowing through organizations' P&Ls, business interruptions, supply chain disruptions, changes to consumer, all those kinds of things that companies have been effectively retaining that risk. And I think organizations around the world are waking up to realize they want to get much smarter about that risk, especially given concerns about climate change.",0.3222606,0.271
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,140,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"The other thing I would say, Craig, is and we can touch on what's going on with the infrastructure and Build Back Better bills, there is going to be a lot of investment in climate resilience, right? So this is trying to understand, let's say, you're a municipality. You want to understand what is the impact of climate change on your municipality?

I mean, these private equity firms out there, as you alluded to earlier, are very flush with capital, cash on the balance sheets and stuff. And it looks to us like 50% to 60% in recent years of bank loan issuance is sponsored related to this stuff. I mean, can you just talk a little bit further about the outlook here, particularly given how low credit spreads are and absolute rates as well, just the bank loan outlook.",2.0849871,0.732
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,143,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. I'd say, Craig, near term, the bank loan outlook looks good for the reasons that you cite. You've got lots of dry powder from the sponsors. You've got low default rates and low forecasted default rates and very tight spreads, low benchmark rates, lots of M&A activity going on, so the outlook for leveraged loans looks good. I think the only question on our mind is really when the dust settles on the year, like we said, volumes are going to be up something like 100%. And the question is, will there be a period of digestion like we saw with investment-grade this past year? Or are we going to see some of these underlying drivers continue to allow the loan market to grow off of these record levels?

Like probably almost every company in the United States, we're seeing the same pressures that's led to a little bit of an uptick in our turnover on a historical basis, but we've also picked up our pace of hiring.

And that is going to be a very important factor in terms of retaining talent, not just about what am I getting paid but where am I going to work? And I can say that we've adopted a pretty flexible approach. I think most of our employees will be in a hybrid mode. We've given lots of flexibility. And frankly, our employees have earned it. They've done a super job over the last 2 years of working remotely. And I think we're really excited to empower our employees to take advantage of that kind of flexibility.

MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,150,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Specifically, let me start with RMS and then I'll move on to the broader. So we are still reviewing the intangible asset valuation for RMS. We do expect the allocation of the purchase price to be very much in line with historical norms. That's going to be around 40% of those amortizable intangible assets. What that translates to is around $17 million really for 2021 pretax and around $59 million pretax really looking forward from 2022. If I combine that holistically across the portfolio for the full year 2021, we're looking at combined depreciation and amortization of around $260-ish million, of which I would say around $158 million, maybe $160 million is really purchase price amortization for this year, and the remainder would be other regular depreciation and amortization.",0.3827534,0.0

And could you just tell us what the fourth quarter issuance year-over-year is implied when you state high single-digit growth for the full year '21? And then I want you to compare that, on the same slide, to the MIS revenues. When you say low teens revenue growth for MIS revenues for the full year, I think that implies 8% or about 8% MIS revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Could you just confirm that?

So we are guiding to an MIS revenue outlook of sort of low teens growth for the full year. I'd argue maybe that's towards the higher end of low teens. And that does imply, to your point, year to go MIS revenue in probably the high single digits and maybe I'll add a higher end of high single digit for MIS.",0.4459153,0.792
MCO-2021-Q3-2021-10-28,154,Answer,2021-10-28,3,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"On the issuance side, we are guiding towards high single digits for the year, and that would imply really mid-teens issuance growth in the fourth quarter. And you are seeing a little bit of negative mix in the fourth quarter as a result of that guidance. And that's primarily driven by the structured finance or specifically, the CLO asset class within structured finance, where you see greater than sort of 100% year-over-year guidance. The issuance itself doesn't necessarily translate as well vis-a-vis some of the other asset classes into per dollar revenue. So that should explain sort of those impacts to you.",0.4220877,0.0

So let me step back just for a minute and address your question holistically given tax is a very fluid area at the moment. And so it may be somewhat premature to speculate about potential impacts. So with that said, there are really 3 primary areas on our tax watch list that we are actively monitoring. First, and this one is probably a little bit obvious, is the Biden administration's tax proposal and the implied impact to Moody's go-forward effective tax rates from potential revisions to the corporate, the GILTI or the FDII rates.",0.1104387,0.796

And instead, we're more likely to see potentially a 15% minimum corporate tax on large corporations as well as possibly a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks. So things are evolving quite quickly here. It's a rough order of magnitude depending on where we actually end up.

First is FX. We are incurring roughly a $0.04 headwind from our FX assumption as of the end of September visited the comparable period last year. The delay in Max is probably worth another $0.01 or so.

It's really at the intersection of our efforts in both China and ESG. China is the second largest green bond market globally, after the U.S. It's over $40 billion of issuance last year.

And one thing I -- distinction I wanted to draw between what we've done with Moody's Local and the earlier question with CCXI and the branding. These are wholly-owned subsidiaries that we have in Latin America. So, we've decided to take a bit of a new approach in the region around the domestic bond markets, because -- and it's interesting you look at the overall rating opportunity in Latin America, a meaningful part of that is coming from the domestic bond markets. So we rebranded as Moody's Local and the focus is going to be providing as the name says, local ratings in local language to meet specific local needs.

The Latin America -- the overall Latin America for MIS is actually a fairly small part of the overall total of our revenues.

When we're looking at the ESG space. First of all were looking at a much more fragmented market than some of the core markets that we operate in. So there are large number of competitors. There are not a lot of established standards. There is a move towards standards that I think is going to be helpful for the ESG sector.,0.8621452,0.727

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,117,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",But SingTel and Four Twenty Seven are more in the environmental sector.

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,118,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W.

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,121,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"And then, I think Ray is right. I mean we're going to be monetizing this both through the businesses that we've acquired, but also through the integration of the data and the analytics in products in services in both MA and MIS. Maybe just to spotlight a little bit. And there's also the growth of what I think I'll call the labeled bond market started as the green bond market, but really has gone beyond that into -- more broadly into sustainability. And that market has been growing quite rapidly.",0.7433132,0.665
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,122,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So label bond volumes are going to hit something like $280 billion of issuance this year. Something like $220 billion, $230 billion of that is in green bonds and another $40 billion to $50 billion is in social and sustainability. So that's an emerging area. And then you've got sustainability in green-linked loans. And that's probably something like another $70 billion. So you can see your way to about $350 billion of this labeled bond issuance.

So we think we're really well placed in this market with the Vigeo Eiris acquisition, because that's given us a leadership position in the label bond space that we're going to continue to build on.

What was it a year ago? And then also did I hear you correctly say you thought that costs for the fourth quarter would likely be similar to the first quarter level? I have a follow-up.",0.2625571,0.675
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,146,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Thanks Craig. Incentive compensation for the third quarter of 2019 was $65 million. The comparable number for the third quarter of 2018 was $43 million. From an expense ramp perspective, from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019, we're expecting less than $10 million. And we do expect that obviously fourth quarter expenses to be below both the second and third quarter level as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program and other cost control initiatives.",2.8721634,0.691

Then Ray I wanted to ask you your updated thoughts on the debt issuance environment right now when you sort of think about the credit spreads in the U.S. and Europe if you think about your outlook for default rates the economic outlook? And then how you sort of -- what you sort of sense now in the debt issuance environment?,0.2126549,-0.217
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,148,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Rob offered I think some very good thoughts on this earlier in the call. But what we're seeing obviously is an accommodative environment for debt issuance. There are limits to the positive attributes of low interest rates, especially as we look outside the United States where negative interest rates are increasingly important feature of the debt markets.",0.2366384,0.458
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,149,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would observe that the reason for negative interest rates is I would actually characterize negative interest rates as a headwind as opposed to a tailwind, because it's a policy and market response to expectations for very low or negative growth. And so -- while low interest rates are positive, this trend to ultra-low rates and negative rates, I think, we would have to count -- I would at least count it as a headwind.",0.2963509,-0.658

Your guidance for the year -- the updated guidance adjusted EPS of $8.05 to $8.20. I mean, historically you guys are typically conservative with your outlook. It seems to me like that might be the case here again in the remaining part of this year.",0.0779517,0.361
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,153,Question,2019-10-30,3,2019,Craig Huber,Huber Research,"I'm just wondering what you're sensing? What's in your budget here to make the top of the range only $8.20, because, I mean, just look at the math you've done $6.29 of adjusted EPS through nine months and as far as $1.90 $1.91 of EPS in the fourth quarter. Decently below what you had each of the first three quarters, are you basically forecasting transaction revenues, for example, in your ratings area to be down versus what you had, let's say, the two middle quarters fairly meaningful?",0.3705153,0.287

And Mark Kaye offered some commentary earlier about the impact of FX, the divestiture of Max. And I would add to that, that we're hopeful and expect that we're going to have a solid quarter for the fourth quarter. The early numbers on October are encouraging.",0.186878,0.883
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,155,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And as Mark said, those early numbers, although they are preliminary, are leaning us more to the upper end of that $8.05 to $8.20 range. If we're looking for what could go wrong as opposed to what could go right, I would have to say that if we saw a pull forward into the September-October period from what would've come in November and December, we may not see as much strength as people are anticipating for closing out the year. So the amount of opportunistic financing that goes on in these last couple of months is obviously an important factor. So I'll leave it at that unless Mark Kaye wants to add anymore.

We can continue to have strength in the form of opportunistic refinancing, especially by infrequent issuers that would be very beneficial for the business. The timing of some of the product sales on the Moody's Analytics side can be influential and could help the fourth quarter. Maybe, Rob wants to offer a couple of comments on what the pipeline looks like. That might be helpful.",0.2805013,0.938
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,158,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. Sure, Ray. So in the U.S., I'd say, that in the investment-grade market we're still seeing pretty strong investor appetite. You saw earlier this week a mid-sized acquisition finance deal get done that was heavily oversubscribed. So that's good to see. My sense is, we're going to have active weeks heading into Thanksgiving here in the United States. I'd say the same for investment grade in Europe, pretty strong pipeline. We've got U.S. issuers also looking to tap the euro market, given where rates are there.",2.4404659,0.977
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,159,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"For leveraged finance, really both in the U.S. and Europe, we've seen some bifurcation of market sentiments. So you've got very strong demand for the larger more well-known spec grade issuers in that Ba category. And you can see that with the Ba index at record lows in terms of yield. We saw a recent print in Europe for a Ba2 name, it was the lowest coupon ever in the high-yield space.",1.257981,-0.149
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,160,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So, in general, I'd expect issuance to continue in November and early December. Ray talked about the pull forward. There's also the potential, I guess, that some deals in the pipeline could slide into Q1. Just given the expectation for accommodative conditions to continue well into next year.",1.3908542,0.273
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,161,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So the other thing I would mention is that in the U.S. public finance market, which is -- we saw very good issuance this quarter that continues to be active. And we're seeing this trend of taxable refunding because you've got very low funding costs and that means the economics are favoring the refunding of tax exempt debt with taxable debt. So if we see that keep up that could provide maybe some upside to our outlook.",1.228214,0.402

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,164,Question,2019-10-30,3,2019,George Tong,Piper Jaffray,"Hi, thanks good morning. Global issuance volume is on track to be flat this year. And you mentioned that volumes next year could be flat to possibly up mid-single digits. Can you comment on how the pricing environment and rating should change depending on issuance growth, and if you've seen improving pricing power especially among infrequent issuers?",,0.881
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,165,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think that the impact of pricing - well, first of all when we talked about three points of contribution from price that's assuming a static debt market profile both in terms of the issuance volumes and the mix of frequent and infrequent issuers. So when we see growth, for example, in infrequent issuers we get more benefit because they are being priced on a transactional basis as opposed to on a long-term basis.",1.2591227,0.51
MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,166,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's why the pricing even though we can talk about pricing at a relatively -- in a relatively simple way, it's impacted potentially materially up or down by both issuance and by mix because some of the pricing does relate to bonds actually being issued. And so if they're not, there's no price impact. So I don't see any change in course around that in 2020. And we'll have to watch carefully to see what the insurance levels and mix are and the impact on price from that.",0.2782897,0.337

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,168,Question,2019-10-30,3,2019,George Tong,Piper Jaffray,"Got it. That's helpful. On margins you've previously indicated that long-term EBITDA margin should be in the high 40s.

MCO-2019-Q3-2019-10-30,169,Answer,2019-10-30,3,2019,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the biggest factor that would prevent that would be the relatively higher growth rate year-on-year coming out of Moody's Analytics. And Moody's Analytics well, obviously, it's been consistently expanding margins over the last few years. It's still a lower margin business than the credit rating agency.

I mean we have a very robust business in the cross-border bond market coming out of China. Not surprisingly this is with China's largest corporate and financial institutions for the most part including both private and state-owned enterprises. We continue to get new rating mandates coming from China that has been a steady stream. And just to try and balance that commentary a little. If China is going to have some relative sluggishness in its economic growth and I emphasize relative because it's pretty good by global standards obviously. That may slow at least cyclically some of the cross-border activity coming out of China both for new rating mandates and for entities that are already rated and thinking about whether they want to raise additional debt.,1.0331736,0.912

I don't anticipate this is going to make a big difference in issuance levels. Certainly, with the 30% interest deductibility cap, there will be some impact on more speculative grade companies that may reach that cap. But, I don't believe it's going to fundamentally change the capital structure or thinking about debt issuance and leverage at these firms. I would also point out that the benefit we would get from moving to a 20% tax rate would be much more substantial than what I would anticipate being any decrease in revenue from reduced debt issuance.",1.1242167,0.878

I think we do want to make sure that everyone continues to understand the 20% proposed corporate tax rate would be dramatically beneficial for Moody's if in fact that rate did come to pass. To think about the math, everyone should look at 1% decrease in our estimated tax rate, would be $0.07 to $0.08 in EPS.

That requires that we have a catch-up in terms of our percentage completion of our performance on that new target. For the corporation as a whole, we've adjusted incentive compensation. We had to add $35.6 million to that amount. That includes incentive compensation. And then, in salaries and benefit, we've also had to add approximately $22 million; this will include about $5 million we're thinking of global profit sharing for the firm.

The growth in MIS expenses, as Linda said, primarily due to the higher incentive comp accruals. If you look at our year-to-date adjusted operating margin versus prior year, you'll see about 300 basis points of margin expansion. And taking account of the catch-up accrual for incentive comp that Linda talked and last year's restructuring charge that you can see, our adjusted operating margins is largely consistent -- for the third quarter is largely consistent with that year-to-date figure.",1.2799827,0.852

We know this is obviously early days, we'll see what changes. But like, when you mentioned Ray on the spec rate side there could be some impact, do you have some more like numbers you can share with us like when you look at your rated debt today, how many of those companies would be hitting those thresholds? And then secondarily on the taxes, are there other things that you didn't mention to the earlier question that we should be thinking about? For example, yesterday, private equity companies got pretty hard in the market because there's some worry. Obviously, those are big users of debt as the companies private et cetera.

MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,61,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Raymond W.

But, the spreads remain tight. And in fact, the default rate forecast is for the default rate to be declining over the next 12 months, which should further encourage tight spreads. So, there's some -- there are some good news items around the debt issuance profile, even as we look at potentially rising rate environment and as we look at coming off very fulsome years for debt issuance, both in the bond and loan sectors. So, I'm not anticipating that either the tax reform or other conditions in the market are going to be generating a strong directional change in 2018 issuance.

I think probably, the most informative thing you might do is look at the amount of revenue we recognized for that business in the third quarter, carrying in mind, we only had seven weeks of the business and add back in the deferred revenue adjustment. And then, if you annualize that number, you get a very nice number that I think will compare very favorably to what we showed in that 8-K filing. So, I think if you do that math, you'll see some very nice acceleration in revenue growth.

MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,67,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"Okay. So, accounting class begins now. Deferred revenue haircut. So, the first part of this is, this was fully expected and the adjustment is required by acquisition accounting. It gets amortized as a revenue reduction over the remaining period of customer contracts that were inherited as of the acquisition date. So, this is going to affect us in 2017 and to some extent into 2018. So, what we need to do is fair value all the assets and the liabilities acquired. And the fair value of the deferred revenue is the cost to sell those contracts plus a reasonable profit margin. So, the total estimated impact, the total deferred revenue haircut is expected to be about $52 million. And as a result, BVD's revenue contribution will be reduced by about $39 million for this year and an estimated $13 million, which will continue through August of next year for fiscal year 2018.

I guess, a lot of the stuff that we're reading from our credit analysts in-house and the papers and so forth, as you know the reduction in the tax rate, some of the deductibility, et cetera, et cetera will lower leverage and so, probably, over a decade close that reduction.

I would also -- I would say that a strong economic environment, where firms are investing back in their business are identifying opportunities for growth, is a positive environment, not only for those firms but for the rating side of the business as well.

MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,84,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"Sure. So, we have a special bonus slide here in terms of looking at what is going on with our guidance, and let me step through this. So, that slide should be up right now, if you're looking at the webcast. So, we had started with full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of a range of $5.35 to $5.50. We have noted that we have now -- we have the addition of legacy amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and that is $0.12 for the change in guidance for this year or it accounts for about 25% of the $0.50 step up in terms of our guidance. The legacy MCO business weighted pretty heavily toward the MIS business that's given us about $0.28 of the guidance increase. And again, that's about 55% of this amount. So, you should very much expect that that part of the business has driven the majority of this increase in guidance. And then, lastly, Bureau van Dijk's performance adds about $0.10 in terms of what we're looking for on the addition to the guidance this year or about 20% of that step up. All together, if you add those, you get to about $0.50. The new range is $5.85 to $6 and we've got a couple of footnotes here in terms of things that have been included. And I think we've got about $0.04 of FX impact in here, and the accounting team is nodding. So, that's good. So, it has a minimal effect in terms of the $0.50 increase, so less, certainly than 10% in this, increase is attributable to FX.",,0.979

Obviously, the Asian corporate story importantly, part of that is China, we think that is a long-term trend; that surge we're seeing in infrastructure issuance also something that I think would be a longer term secular trend.

But for investment grade bonds so far this year we've seen $1.1 trillion in issuance; that's year-to-date. And the view for the year is flat to up 5%. You'll recall, when we started last year, the view for this year was supposed to be flat to down 10.

November is expected to be greater than $75 billion. Spreads remain three-year tight, and the current state of the market is robust. For high yield bonds, $250 billion of issuance this year, up 10% to 15% for the full year expected. High yield bond issuance remains substantially above last year's levels. Similar to investment grade market, high yield spreads are near three-year right, low volatility in the face of everything going on geopolitically.

Headed over to Europe, same view again, this is the coming from the banks, investment grade. We've seen a busy period of investment grade and bond issuance. We expect -- they expect that for the remainder of the year, spreads and rates remain near historic lows. There are positive investor fund flows. The European central bank has talked about lengthy period for QE. And Eurozone GDP growth is running at the fastest pace in seven years and that will also continue to support the market despite that the inflation has been quite quiet.

MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,101,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Mark Almeida,,"What I was referring to was we've had a couple of situations already where we've gone to customers with a joint product offering. So, BVD product together with the Moody's Analytics product just offering a more complete or more comprehensive solution to customers' information needs. And I mean, frankly, that was part of the one of the important premises of the acquisition was that we thought there were opportunities for us to do that, and so we're seeing that. So, by joining our product offerings together, we're finding that we're able to meet a broader set of needs or broader set of customers. And as a result, we're able to displace some competitors. So, we've had a couple of examples of that already. And it's still early days. We think there is a lot more opportunities there for us.",,0.871

MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,103,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"And Joe, let me explain just one of the things. The 8-K that couple of people have mentioned, that 8-K is a bit of an unusual formatting of looking at numbers. And it is by regulation, required to be, BVD management's projections from their audited 2016 financial statements, which you'll recall are in a different -- they're in Dutch IFRS, we're in U.S. GAAP. And our growth expectations you'll recall, we have revenue synergies as well that we are looking at. So, when you add those synergies in, you can get to the bridge between the two. And as we said before, we still expect those synergies to come along, as Mark has said. So, I just want to make sure that that is well understood.",,0.826

It sounds like you're fairly comfortable with the impact of what the tax reform will be and issuance. It sounds like you got a ticker in Analytics business with BVD. So, I guess I'm wondering what areas or what do you think are the great unknown as you head into next year, particularly on the margin side but a little bit on the demand front as well, what are you concerned about?

So, we plan to provide a view on 2018 on our 4Q earnings call, as we always do. And that allows us account for Christmas through the end of the year and other factors like Wall Street estimates and updated macro assumptions. But that said, we certainly see some themes that will shape our outlook. And Ray's touched on a few of these. But, we see support for issuance growth coming from a number of factors that includes economic growth, continued M&A volumes, modest geopolitical risks, improving commodity prices in a low and actually declining, as Ray and Linda pointed to declining default environment. And, we continue to enjoy some very constructive market conditions; Linda touched on that. And we think that should carry over in to next year.",1.2808456,0.926
MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,107,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"The question marks for us as we look into next year. Asia's ability to grow off of a very robust issuance growth in 2017, further growth in the U.S. investment grid sector off some very robust recent levels, the potential of deceleration of reifi activity that we've seen in 2017, particularly in the bank loan space, and whether we will see an improvement in U.S. public finance refunding activity, which has been down pretty sharply throughout this year. The last thing I would point to is just the potential increase in volatility poses a risk. If you think about this past year, we really didn't see any kind of shutdowns, market shutdowns where the market closed for one or two weeks. And so, if we were to see that that would obviously provide some downside.",0.7402934,0.95
MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,108,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"Sure. And Joe, we're not going to be brave enough to forecast an estimated tax rate for next year, yet. We're working with about 30% for this year. And again, if we do see any reduction in the tax rate, again, $0.07 to $0.08 for each percentage that the tax rate -- corporate tax rate might come down, that would be a benefit to us, if that does in fact happen.",,0.827
MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,109,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"We would note that we continue to have the ability to price, and we do insist on value for our issuers in terms of price, but the 3% to 4% view continues. And we would also note that growth and interest rate increases are not necessarily a bad condition for Moody's. We've often shown that in 2008-2009 and 2012-2013, when interest rates went up more than 100 basis points during those year-long periods, MIS's revenue in fact increased. And if we do see some growth in the economy, we may see some increase in issuance for capital expenditures, which has really been lacking as the use of proceeds. In recent years, we've been working mostly on refinancing and also payments to shareholders, as well as M&A activity. So, we would love to see a broadening in use of proceeds. And again, as rates move up, as has been speculated about, that is not necessarily a negative condition for Moody's if that is brought about by strong or good growth in the economy. And Ray may have some other thoughts.",,0.995

So, a lot of maturing debt for 2018 has been part of the 2017 story. What we're looking at though is, again, a substantial build of the refinancing walls, each year. So, the fact that 2018 now doesn't have much refinancing in its profile, we look to 2019, 2020, and the walls build every year, from 2018 out. So, it really becomes I think more of a question of will firms seek opportunistically to pull forward from multi-year refinancing walls. And that is what we've been seeing to-date, I think.

We have to think about the trajectory of margins for the legacy business and then think about what the impact of BVD is? We've talked about work that we're doing to drive margin expansion in the legacy business, principally by expanding the profitability in the ERS segment. We are continuing to make progress on that, we delivered good results in the quarter. The margin expansion, you saw in the quarter, about half of that was due to BVD and the other half was organic. And that's true, if you look at the nine-month margin expansion in MA as well.

And I'm wondering about your confidence and the sustainability of the margin leverage in the context of what could be slower revenue growth in 2018?",0.7223975,0.936
MCO-2017-Q3-2017-11-03,161,Answer,2017-11-03,3,2017,Linda Huber,,"Peter, it's Linda. I'm going to let Rob get warmed up here. But, I'd probably have to get out some of these drag points that we have, just to make sure that everybody understands what's happening in MIS. I'm going to ask Rob to touch on the fact that we've had 6% recurring revenue growth in MIS and Rob can talk about that. So, that's something that we're happy with. Secondly, he's been shy so far to talk about the new mandates we've seen in the third quarter of 2017. He's got 264 new mandates, up 18% from the third quarter of last year; that's a 40% increase in the year-to-date period. And he's got expectation for more than 900 new mandates for the full year of 2017. So, with that preamble, I'll let Rob pick it up from here.",,-0.743

On one hand, we have to continue to make investments in the business. Obviously, we've had a lot of issuance volume. It helps when that issuance volume is in the form of refinancing activity.

But, while the new rating mandates do not generally drive the highest margin component of the ratings business, they are a very high quality source of revenue, because it establishes new relationships and translates over time into monitoring fees and additional ratings. So, that's really I think the best quality revenue that we get as those new rating relationships.",0.0095835,0.667

And we're on pace for that for 2017. We've made commitments that we're going to delever back to more normalized level, reflecting our BBB plus rating and we're on path to do that as well.

There is no one factor that is driving the narrow credit spreads that we're seeing. I do think the low default rate environment and low default rate expectation going forward is a central component.

We note that we may have some accounting -- some balance sheet adjustments in the first quarter of 2018. You will see an estimate as to what we think about that in the 10-Q that we're about to release. We don't think that that will have a material impact on 2018 but we have to continue to do our work. We do see that standard 606 still may introduce a bit of quarterly volatility, but over the full year should not be material. And again, you'll see that some companies including us will have some estimate ranges in this quarter's Q. You should take a look at that.

Moody's Analytics also continued to exhibit steady growth. Operating expense for the first quarter was $532 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2016. Operating income was $443 million, up 46% from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization of $476 million was up 42% from the prior-year period.

Including the $0.31 CCXI gain, we now anticipate full year 2017 EPS in the range of $5.46 to $5.61. Excluding the gain, we anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be toward the upper end of the range of $5.15 to $5.30, reflecting the likely impact of some debt issuance pull-forward during the first quarter, while recognizing ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.",,0.866

Non-U.S. revenue of $397 million was up 18% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on Moody's revenue was negligible.

Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Moving to the lines of business for MIS; first, global corporate finance revenue for the first quarter was $353 million, up 47% from the challenging prior-year period. This year's results reflected robust leveraged finance issuance especially of U.S. bank loans. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 41% and 61% respectively. Second, structured finance revenue totaled $100 million, up 11% from the prior-year period, primarily as a result of increased U.S. CLO and ABS issuances. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 8% and 15% respectively. Third, financial institutions revenue of $112 million is up 18% from the prior-year period. This result was driven primarily by an increase in issuance from infrequent issuers. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 26% and 13% respectively.",,0.912

Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Fourth, public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $98 million was up 7% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by an increase in global infrastructure issuance partially offset by a decline in U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 3% and 15% respectively. Finally, MIS Other, which consists of non-ratings revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $5 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter, down 38% from the prior-year period.

Growth was mainly driven by credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were up 5% and 8%, respectively. Second, global enterprise risk solution, or ERS, revenue of $96 million was up 7% from last year due to the March 2016 acquisition of GGY.

As we continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher margin products, product sales were up 25%, while service sales declined 8% with about half of the growth in product sales attributable to last year's acquisition of GGY. Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 2% from the prior period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 9%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%.",,0.836

The increase in the operating expense was primarily attributable to higher accruals for incentive compensation, and the March 2016 acquisition of GGY. This increase was partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 1% and the impact of ongoing cost management initiative. As Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 45.5%, up 820 basis points from 37.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 48.8%, up 790 basis points from 40.9%.",,0.848

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,30,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"Well, you can see from our updated guidance that we did not fully roll-through the very strong first quarter into the remainder of the year. We think it's going to provide a benefit and that's why we're guiding to the upper end of the range. But we're also cognizant of the fact that refinancing continues to be a very heavy driver of issuance and that characterized the first quarter in the corporate sector in particular. So, looking out for the remainder of the year, we think some activity that we initially had anticipated would go later in the year, did get pulled-forward into the first quarter. And if you're looking for upside to our current guidance, I think you'd be looking to more new money borrowing and we can certainly make a case for that with a strong economy. And I hope that's what happens, but that's what's guiding our outlook at a high level currently.",,0.831

And then, just with ratings having such a strong quarter, I'm assuming there was a less of the impact to the Moody's Analytics margin from increased overhead. So, can you just talk about if that 80 basis points of expansion we saw in the quarter at Moody's Analytics, is representative of core margin expansion and if not what the core expansion would have looked like there?",,0.785
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,32,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"I'll let Mark Almeida answer this in a little more detail, but we do anticipate ongoing expansion margin at Moody's Analytics, but we do not expect that line to be completely smooth. Mark, do you want to comment?",,0.115
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,33,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp,,"Sure. First, to your question about overhead allocation, the way we allocate corporate overhead to the business lines, I don't think it's as dynamic as what your question suggested. The share of overhead allocation is fixed, so it doesn't change from quarter-to-quarter. So, in other words, what you saw in Q1 was indeed core expansion in the Moody's Analytics margin. And I think as Ray said, what we're seeing there is exactly what we've been talking about for some time that as the enterprise risk solutions business matures, as the product offering matures, and we shift from being engaged in doing a lot of the spoke work for customers to doing more standard product delivery. We would expect to see more margin coming out of that business and I think that's what you see going on here. As Ray said, that's not going to be a straight line, but we do expect continued gradual improvement in the Moody's Analytics margin as a result of that.",,0.846

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,37,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp,,"Well, last year, we had a strong second half after a weak first half. We don't expect that second half of this year is going to be weak, but we do anticipate that we're going to have a stronger first half than second. That being said, the full year outlook in terms of issuance: for investment grade, it's flat to down by perhaps 10%; for high yield, it's flat to up about 5%; and for leveraged loans up 5% to 10%. Those aren't big changes from where we were when we spoke to you in February, but it's a little less optimistic on the investment grade side and more optimistic on the leveraged loan side.",,0.75

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,39,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp,,"Sure. I'll take the second part first and then maybe Linda would like to comment on the tax situation here in the U.S. But yes, we have been cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year, actually beginning in the second quarter in the European context of elections for France, UK, Germany, Italy. And so, the more those outcomes turn out to be expected outcomes, the more confidence the market is going to have and we would probably expect to see more economic momentum and hopefully more debt activity, but there is going to be a level of anxiety around each of these elections throughout the year and they are spaced out throughout the year So, I imagine, we're going to be having periods of relative optimism and then periods where market participants pull back, awaiting the outcome of these various elections.",,0.84

Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Joe, just wanted to be clear that this guidance does not incorporate any of the Trump tax proposals, because as you know such proposals have a long way to go before they're enacted as legislation. Just as a way to think about what potentially could happen, of course a lowering of the corporate tax rate would be helpful for Moody's, you can take a look at that by thinking about 1 percentage point drop in our estimated tax rate, would give us $0.07 to $0.08 on the EPS line.",,0.318
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,41,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"We did note that the latest proposal did not mention interest deductibility limitation, nor did it mention a border tax adjustment, and we would not expect that the deemed repatriation tax would have a meaningful impact on issuance, because offshore cash is held very closely by a small number of companies. So, generally the majority of scenarios that have been discussed would be net positive for Moody's, of course the details would matter quite a bit. And that's the basis of what we know at this time, but again none of these proposals are baked into anything we're saying today.",,0.205

Just wanted to come back to the early retirement of debt with the pull-forward comments, Ray you made earlier. Just wondering if you can flush it out a little bit more, I guess what are you hearing when you're talking to corporates or to banks, I mean is this just a typical, we think rates are moving higher, let's go now, is this, hey, let's get ahead of tax policy changes, because some banks are telling us it's a wise thing to do now and how does that impact the longer-term outlook for refinancing, just what are you hearing I guess is my question at the end of the day.",,0.691
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,45,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"I think it's each of the items you identified and right now, rates and spreads are very attractive. So, it is a good opportunity for issuers to be in the market, whether it's refinancing or new money or upping their outstanding debt. These are attractive conditions and looking ahead to potential interest rate increases going forward. And again some of the uncertainty that comes with the geopolitical situation and the elections in Europe. Yeah, we do think issuers are taking advantage and we're certainly not anticipating a weak second half of the year, as I said earlier, but the kind of growth we've seen early in this year, we just don't think is going to be sustained.",,0.929
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,46,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. Alex, it's Linda, I think we should also point out that again for us last year, we had the reverse pattern where the second half of the year was much stronger so the comps become more difficult for us. Just to kind of go through the views we're hearing from various investment banks, and again, these are not Moody's views, the first quarter was a record issuance for investment grade and that reflects low market volatility, attractive rates and tight spreads, as Ray said, $450 billion of issuance through the end of April. And once we get through the blackouts, we expect issuance to pick up in May. Last week, it was $40 billion in issuance which is pretty strong, this week's calling for $30 billion to $35 billion, and with the tenure at 2-3-6, that remains a pretty attractive set of issuance conditions for investors. We do expect as is being noted this morning about 94% probability that the Fed will do a rate hike in June. Thus far, that has seemed to mostly flatten yield curve.",,0.937
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,47,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"For high yield bonds, it's been a bit of a mixed condition, it's $100 billion so far this year. The pipeline is light-ish due to the factors that Ray had commented on. That's contracted with leverage loans, which has been $300 billion of issuance to date this year. The activity is moving to the leveraged loan market. We saw a record start to 2017, but this is important, Alex. 75% of that volume is from refinancing and re-pricing. CLO issuance has also been robust, $25 billion year-to-date and the pipeline is strong in these areas and we look to that for increased activity.",,0.908
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,48,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"In Europe, things are quite positive. The euro and sterling markets are resilient, conditions are constructive, spreads at all-time lows, rates historically low, but the busy political calendar offsets that potentially and we will see some choppiness. On spec rate in Europe, strong leveraged financing activity, leveraged loan activity reached a post financial crisis high in Q1. High yield bond spreads in Europe at a 10-year low and of course as we mentioned, the macro conditions again may cause choppiness in the speculative grade market as well, but generally, pretty good conditions and we'll have to see what happens, but if you want to finance, the market remains quite attractive.",,0.937
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,49,Question,2017-05-05,1,2017,Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC,,"Very true. Thank you. And then just secondly, maybe a little bit more longer term, but a couple of months ago at a conference, you changed one of the slides in your typical presentation deck a little bit. I think you had this long-term slide that you used a lot in terms of the algorithm of the long-term growth and you changed that, I think to some degree, kind of took away with some of the boxes that you have to have and you also reduced the longer-term growth rate. You may have addressed this already at the conferences, but can you just kind of like talk about what this change was all about, like how you're thinking about the long-term algorithm the company may have changed or if this is more of a, the next few years are different? So just flesh out why the long-term change there was. Thank you.",,0.959
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,50,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"Sure. First of all, I think it's important to underline that there is no change in our outlook for the revenue areas that we have under our control. This is pricing Moody's Analytics in the sense that it's a non-capital markets component of our business. Coverage, new mandates, all of that remains consistent with the views that we've had in recent years. The new slide and the discussion that we've had around that reflects our view that we're looking at protracted lower GDP growth, especially in developed economies. For 2017, the MIS GDP forecasts for the G20 are about 3%, but importantly, the U.S. is at 2.4% and the euro area at 1.3%. And between the U.S. and the euro area we were looking at 85% of our revenue. So, we're taking that into account in terms of the pace at which debt markets are going to be expanding given this low-ish or some period of time outlook on GDP. In that kind of environment, we're going to continue a strong focus on managing costs and our capital allocation.",,0.7

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,54,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"Yeah, sure Tim. What we did was our joint venture, CCXI, issued additional shares in order to merge with another rating agency in China. And that merger reduced our holding in the combined company from 49% to 30%. We didn't sell any. We didn't sell down. But we have a smaller piece of a larger company. Strategically the reason we did this was by combining these two rating agencies, we now own licenses through our joint venture to compete in all areas of the domestic Chinese market, both what's called the interbank market which is large and somewhat slower growing, and the exchange traded market, which is smaller but faster growing. So that the fact that we are now able to provide rating and research services through our joint venture in all areas of the Chinese capital market, we think is strategically very important. And we had the revaluation of our original 2006 investment in the joint venture as a part of this process and that's what led to the gain.",,0.931
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,55,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah, Tim, it's Linda. Let me just also explain the tax effect of this, because we got a lot of questions about this. Our tax rate guidance has come down. The effective tax rate for 2017, the guidance now is approximately 30% and that was reduced from the prior guidance of 31% to 32% and that's due to the impact of the non-taxable CCXI gain. That change is a GAAP guidance item, but again because that was not taxable, the overall ETR for the year comes down. If you wanted to strip that out, the tax guidance would be back to the 31%, 32% where it was, but this is a permanent change downward for this year.",,0.593

As Ray said, we have a growing presence with our cross-border business in MIS in China, offices in Beijing and Shanghai. And I think, what you're referring to in China is the State Council of China announced that the foreign investment restriction in domestic CRA industry would be lifted.

So, we couldn't return it dollar-for-dollar. I think it would be fair to say that the strong majority we could bring back. We obviously would be able to respond very quickly if such a change does become law, but right now, it's not. And if we did make a decision like that, the use of those - that return of cash would be subject to the usual decision-making process that we do, regarding our capital allocation.

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,84,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"I'm not going to confirm that, let's take a look next year. It depends on a whole lot of things including one-off audits that we have to look at and various other things, the mix of our business between the U.S. and offshore is a very heavy driver of that tax rate. And there's some indications that the headline tax rate in the UK comes down, but yet they are limiting interest deductibility. So there is a lot that goes into that number and it could change if any one of those situations change. So, on this one, we're just going to let you do whatever you'd like there.",,0.827

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,88,Question,2017-05-05,1,2017,Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.,,"Thanks. So, Linda, the preliminary question is can you quantify please the bonus accruals for the first quarter and then a follow-up related to how you answer that.",,0.827
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,89,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yes. Sure, Peter. So, the incentive comp accrual in the first quarter went up pretty considerably from last year, last year in incentive comp, we did $32.2 million, this year we did $52 million. Now, that includes two components and it's important to understand that. And of that change, which is about $20 million, $15 million of it is the over-performance that we put up in the first quarter. The other five relates to normal increases that we do with target bonuses year-over-year. So, the out-performance is really the $15 million piece of that Peter. And if you want to look at the modeling for the rest of the year, you might want to look at $40 million to $45 million number for each of the remaining quarters, but the one thing I could you promise you is that we'll get that wrong because it depends on the performance quarter-by-quarter, but we did have very good performance in the first quarter, so we put up the heftier number based on the percentage of completion of our budget for the year.",,0.895
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,90,Question,2017-05-05,1,2017,Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.,,"Got it. Okay. So, the follow-up then is that ex that increase your costs were basically flat year-to-year in the quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So, I guess this is cheating, but there are two sub questions to this. Number one, why not even a bigger accrual for the bonus in the first quarter given just the extraordinary strength in issuance? And two, why cost is flat for the first quarter?",,0.917
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,91,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Sure. I'll tackle the second one first and yeah, thank you very much for noting. We've been working very hard on keeping our expense growth limited. Now some of you may have noticed, we went from low single-digits to mid single-digits and that's just because we were at the very cusp of this line, so we've bumped just lightly from the highest end of low single-digits to the lowest end of mid single-digits, if you could follow that, it really doesn't amount to very much. The expense growth that we had, Peter, you're right, comes primarily from this higher incentive comp and the costs from the GGY acquisition which we're about to lap.",,0.649
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,92,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"So, we've been pretty happy with that. We've worked very hard to keep tight control on hiring. If you looked at the head count for the corporation year-over-year, we're actually down 1% first quarter this year versus last year. A lot of that is that we've reduced head count slightly in shared services. Rob has kept a very good handle on the rating agency's head count, and Mark's business where we've had very good growth has had a little increase. But we're also very careful where we put the people and we're looking at lower cost jurisdictions, where a number of them have gone for shared services. So pretty happy with all of that. We continue to maintain our discipline, even through we've had this very strong first quarter.",,0.98
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,93,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"And the incentive comp accrual is based on where we think we're going to be for the year and that percentage of completion, so it's sort of a formulaic thing. If we had taken up our guidance, Peter, that would have been a different case and we would have had to move more aggressively on incentive comp in the first quarter. As you know, we've moved to the upper end of our guidance range. So we went with the $15 million. So hope that gets you everything you need.",,0.681

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,97,Question,2017-05-05,1,2017,Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC,,"Great. Thanks. Just a question on the slide on the investment bank issue. Do those reflect or I guess, do your internal forecasts differ significantly from any of those? And then, I guess I'm trying to understand why the downward or sort of slight downward adjustment for high-yield investment grade, just for the full year versus what was spoken about last quarter, because I guess I just kind of struggle with it. It's been pulled forward and conditions remain pretty favorable. Why sort of soften those for the full year?",,0.902
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,98,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Sure. Warren, these views that Ray and I quoted from are summation of a number of banks. Sometimes they match up with our internal view and sometimes they don't. I think that there are a couple of things going on there. There is some pull forward as you had mentioned, but also in a period where rates may move up, the focus tends to move toward the leveraged loan market which is more of a floating rate market. So I think that's the main reason why high-yield may have softened a bit, because you're seeing a substitution effect over into the leveraged lending side. I will stop here and see if Rob has anything else he wants to add about what's going there.",,-0.785
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,99,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"The only thing I would add to that Linda is, the funds flows in high-yield have been a bit choppy for the year, year-to-date down about $6 billion in outflows. We have seen some stronger inflows in mid-April, but we're still down as opposed to what Linda was talking about. Year-to-date inflows in leveraged loans about $12.5 billion of inflows through mid-April, and that's double what we saw in full-year 2016.",,0.202

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,102,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. I'll touch on maybe a couple of the asset classes. I'm going to focus mostly on the U.S., it's obviously our largest market. In ABS the issuance momentum picked up throughout the quarter, and that was after a slowdown that we had seen in the back half of the fourth quarter, and that's been led by an uptick in autos and cars primarily. Spreads there have flattened and are at multi-year lows, so conditions, issuance conditions good there. We'd expect the activity to moderate a little bit from a very strong March, and we are continuing to see some interest in the esoteric space, renewable energy, those kinds of things.",,0.926
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,103,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"CMBS, spreads are still at very favorable levels. We are nearing the apex of the CMBS refinancing on maturity of loans that originated just pre-crisis in 2006 and 2007. I think everybody is familiar that the activity in CMBS suffered at the beginning of this year, as we saw a pull-forward into the fourth quarter, as folks were trying to get ahead of the risk retention implementation deadlines. We have seen that strengthen a bit in March. I think we'd expect to see that pick up again in the second half of this year. And I would just note that there are a lot of single borrower deals where there's competition to fund by banks and insurance companies. So, we'll see how that plays out.",,0.338
MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,104,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"In CLOs, similarly to the strength in the leveraged loan market, spreads there continue to tighten, again at multi-year lows. We've seen very heavy refinancing activity. That continued all the way into April. I would think that will slow down a bit, probably pick back up again sometime in the third quarter and we are seeing some new CLO issuance in the pipeline. So, it's not just going to be weighted towards all of that refi activity.",,0.34

MCO-2017-Q1-2017-05-05,111,Answer,2017-05-05,1,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. With strength in the leveraged finance markets, we typically see strength in first time issuers. That's where a lot of the first time issuer mandates come from. Those were up very nicely in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2016, over 200 new mandates and up very strongly from the first quarter of 2016 when as you remember we had very weak leveraged finance issuance. I would think that may moderate a little bit, but you've heard our comments and outlook for high yield and bank loan, but we think we'll still be in line with our first time mandate count for the last several years.",,0.67

So in enterprise risk solutions, you saw a really nice acceleration of your trailing 12-months sales growth from 4% in the December quarter to 16% in the March quarter.

They have a very large amount of their renewable business that is - that closes in January and this was the first January that we own that business. So that got rolled into the trailing 12-months sales figure for ERS. So, that's the big driver there.

And this really comes from the fact that a lot of the responsibilities and obligations on analysts have changed post financial crisis and with regulation, and we have to align our business in a way that responds to those both effectively and efficiently and that's what this process is about.

During the year, we made a series of acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and further build out our offerings. The largest of these acquisitions, RMS gives us a world-class insurance data and analytics franchise as well as some sophisticated weather and disaster modeling capabilities.

Favorable market conditions contributed to our strongest year yet in terms of both revenue and rated issuance. And investment-grade supply moderated off what was really a record 2020, but volumes were still substantial.

We expect this increase to be driven by organic investments in our products, solutions and distribution capabilities as well as operating leverage from expanding recurring revenue. As such, over the coming 5 years, we project Moody's revenue to grow by at least 10% on an average annualized basis and adjusted operating margin to stabilize in the low 50s percent range.

First, in 2021, Moody's delivered over $6 billion in revenue and an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate above 20% as our customer-centric approach continue to address their evolving needs.

And when I took over as CEO a little over a year ago, we had a business that was in great shape, and it was really poised for the next chapter of growth. And I was thinking back -- actually before I got on this call, I was thinking back to it a year ago, and I talked about 3 strategic priorities at the time that I thought would really help us reinforce and accelerate growth. And that's probably a word you'll get to hear a lot on the call today. And we've really been active executing on that over the last kind of 12 to 14 months.",0.053063,0.978
MCO-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,75,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"And the first of those is deepening our understanding of our customers, and the reason that's so important is that our customers' needs around risk are evolving very rapidly. I mean the pandemic accelerated that. So risks are more complex. They're more interrelated. There's a wider range of risks that organizations are grappling with. We've talked about that. But better understanding these needs allows us to produce new offerings that our customers value and that then translates into more revenue per customer and adding new customers in new market segments.",0.366264,0.198

And in 2021, we made a number of moves to enhance our offerings and our competitive position in key markets. That included insurance and climate and KYC and commercial real estate.

We've been very clear about that for the last year. We're now focused on activating our people and accelerating our growth. And this year, I think you're going to see us focus on a few key things that are going to contribute to delivering long-term shareholder value: exceeding our customers' expectations by better understanding their sense of value and delivering a better experience; realizing the benefits of investments, especially over the last 12 months because they've been substantial to drive industry-leading growth; building out what we call internally our risk operating system so that we can deliver differentiated integrated solutions; and then finally, making Moody's a place that people want to come and stay.

On the buyback, it looks like you're going to be about 2x what you were in '21. Any thoughts as to what drove that decision? Is that just capital allocation within the context of potential M&A?

I talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about some ongoing tailwinds, and we've got a positive macroeconomic backdrop. We've got healthy M&A pipeline, continuing refinancing needs. But we also -- and we've talked about this a number of times on this call, we've got a tough comp.

MCO-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,87,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"I think a real key to our outlook is around leveraged loans. And you could see that in our guidance is that, we expect leverage loans to be off something like 10% off of what was a really strong year last year. But I would note that there is an enormous amount of private equity money that's got to get put to work. And that's going to continue to drive leverage loan activity, and we have seen that in the month of January despite the fact that there has been some volatility, and that's impacted investment grade and high yield. Leveraged loans have continued a very robust pace. So that for us is really something to watch when you look at the outlook.

And that -- we're going to have to see how that plays out. In terms of kind of the downside, maybe just to touch on a couple of things on our mind there.

It produces -- I think there's a chance for an unexpected surprise, right, any time that you've got something like this going on. And if there's an unexpected surprise, we're going to see bouts of volatility. We've seen a little bit of that already. There wasn't much volatility in the last 2 years. It was just kind of full on.

The MA medium-term revenue outlook that we're providing this morning of low to mid-teens percentage growth really does reflect our confidence in significant opportunity we have given customers demand for our integrated risk assessment products and solutions. We believe there are multiple pods to achieving this target, at least one of which is through continued investment in organic product development and sales distribution capacity.

And putting that in context, we also recognize that strategic success is not only about revenue growth, but also about concurrently expanding the margin. And so we are reaffirming in the outlook that we issued today the medium term, mid-30s MA adjusted operating margin as subscription-based products provide more operating leverage and as recurring revenue comprises an increasing proportion of MA's total revenue over the medium term.",0.580938,0.606

So at the end of last year, we had almost 2,000 credit impact scores, ESG credit impact scores which speak to the impact of E, S and G on an issuer's credit profile. And these scores have got a -- they've got a transparent methodology, but also there's engagement with the issuers and our analysts.

So medium term, low double digits. I guess, again, I'm just scrutinizing here a little bit because it's almost the same, but isn't this essentially a little bit of a lower growth outlook? And is that related to what you just talked about on the ratings side?

MCO-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,116,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Alex, we expect to grow adjusted diluted EPS in the low double digit percent range over the medium term by balancing organic and to the extent inorganic investments with the return of capital to stockholders. The difference between our new medium-term adjusted EPS target and the prior long-term EPS guidance is primarily driven by the expectation for incremental organic strategic investment and reduced capital leverage from share repurchases based on the assumption that Moody's share price continues to increase as well as lower discrete tax benefits on a percentage basis as adjusted net income itself grows.",0.3854009,0.727

So let me just talk about the factors as we develop that range. And you're right, we always talk about issuance activity being highly correlated to GDP growth over the medium to long term. But it's interesting, if you just step back and look at the last couple of years, in 2020, we had economic contraction, and we had enormous issuance. So that relationship hasn't necessarily held. And this year, obviously, as we look forward, we've got economic growth, but our outlook for issuance is to be slightly down. And what I think we've got going on is that there is a digestion and normalization period that's going on here. As we come out of the pandemic and this unprecedented amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus that have driven all of this issuance, and we've had this kind of rapid economic cycles. But on average, we expect that relationship to hold.",0.0500431,0.535
MCO-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,120,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So again, I think there's this normalization and digestion period here. But you're exactly right. The other thing that we're looking at growth in the maturity walls given all of the debt that's been issued over the last several years, and that provides some support or kind of what I think of as like ballast for our transaction-based revenues. On the last earnings call, I think we talked about the forward 4-year refunding needs have increased something like 9% to $4 trillion for U.S. and European issuers. There's just a lot of debt out there that's got to get refinance, and it was something like 19% for U.S. leveraged loan maturities.",0.1169111,0.836
MCO-2021-Q4-2022-02-10,121,Answer,2022-02-10,4,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So there was some pull forward, further pull forward in the fourth quarter, but I don't think it was outside of historical ranges. So these maturity walls still imply some good support for future issuance. We've got pretty good visibility and confidence around recurring revenues, especially with all the first time issuers that have come into the market. I think the recent strength of the leveraged loan market provides support for a view that disintermediation is still alive and well.

On average, MIS revenue growth outperformed issuance by 5.6%. And so my question is when you think about that 5-year outlook, do you feel like the amount of outperformance that MIS will grow faster than issuance might be less over the next 5 years than it was in the past number of years?

So there, you could think about our primary objective is really to maintain or modestly expand MIS' adjusted operating margin within that low 60s range while preferring to reinvest to drive growth, add value and scale over time.

And this is similar to the market dynamics that existed in 2020 and 2021 where 59% and I think 56% of total full year issuance was completed in the first half, respectively.",0.4194402,0.922

And then I would like to probably end here with we are expecting the full year 2020 strategic investment spending of $150 million will be more weighted towards the second half of the year.",0.2855522,0.827

Just the top line growth is the expectation to get at least 10%. And it seems like that's really an organic growth number, it sounds like from the answer to all the various questions.

It's been a theme on this call, to build out the capabilities. And it's been through some of the acquisitions, where we think now we've got world-class capabilities around climate at scale.

Could you say that the busy 2021 M&A engagements that you had -- would you consider that kind of an anomaly or something that the company is positioned to, hey, we're positioned to repeat something like that, that might become more frequent. I mean, the comment you made it seems like you want to digest some of the big bites that you made. But I just wanted to ask you, do you feel like you're positioned differently than you were in the past in terms of doing a larger kind of M&A program kind of that would enhance the already improved organic revenue growth that you've laid out.",,0.959

I guess you might be able to argue, well, isn't there more upside with inflation. I think we just have a long-term view on pricing in the rating agency and MA, I mean, all across the firm.

I see what should be a negative mix shift given high-yield and structured typically have better revenue yields, and those are going down, but you seem very confident in your revenue growth outlook for '22. Just curious, what's the delta? Is that way to think about what the delta is? If you have lower issuance and lower negative mix shift, what's the delta to revenue growth? Is it pricing?

Your guidance calls for mid-single-digit growth in MIS after a year where the segment grew 17% and it looks like non-U.S. is really the strong part. So could you just give us some color on which geographies and products are really driving this high-single-digit growth in non-U.S. in 2018 and just also just what you're seeing so far in 1Q, just given that it's the toughest comp for the year? Thanks.",,0.941
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,45,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,Sure. Maybe we can kick it off by letting Linda talk about the consensus views that we've collected and I know Rob will have some comments on this.,,-0.318
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,46,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. Toni, thanks for the question. I'll start with the views from the various banks that we survey and again, these views are the consensus views of those banks and not - they may not line up exactly with Moody's revenue categorizations. For investment grade bond issuance for 2018, the call is for $1.25 trillion of issuance, which is flat to down 10% from 17%. Notes include that the market remains robust with tight spreads, offsetting rising rates. And January 2018 was the second largest January on record after January of 2017. You probably noticed the growing M&A pipeline among investment grade borrowers and we note the 87% probability of a Fed rate hike in March, with an average expectation of three rate hikes in total in 2018.",,0.802
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,47,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"For high yield, the call is for $285 billion of issuance, flat to up 10% from 2017. Notes include high yield fundamentals remaining strong with demand for new issues, an improving macroeconomic environment and relatively narrow spreads and issuance remains primarily driven by refinancings. Year-to-date 2018 issuance is already up 10% year-over-year and the forward pipeline is characterized as robust. A potential headwind though is tax reform impact on companies with very high amounts of debt and low EBIT and EBITDA and I'm sure we'll talk about that later.",,0.691
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,48,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"On the leveraged loan front, the third category in the U.S., $500 billion is expected for 2018, flat to down 10% from 2017. Notes include that the leveraged loan market remains strong and spreads are narrow. Full-year 2018 is expected to be down slightly from a record 2017, with upside should M&A activity accelerate or if rising rates create further demand for floating rate paper.",,0.599
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,49,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"And switching over to Europe, investment grade in Europe has had a bit of a slower start issuance for the year, but it is expected to pick up post earnings season. Spreads are near historical lows, some concern about the ECB QE tapering, but those are muted and the euro area continues to see strong growth in GDP and corporate profit. Speculative grade in Europe, notes include high yield and leveraged loan markets are in good shape with strong forward pipeline, though issuance levels faced tough comps as compared to strong 2017. Spreads are narrowed due to strong demand and those are fueling opportunistic issuance. So again, that's the view from the bank. And then I'll ask Rob to comment a little bit more about the various sectors.",,0.971
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,50,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. Thanks, Linda. So Linda provided the Street estimates for issuance, overall for U.S. corporate generally flattish to slightly down. Our forecast is broadly in line with those estimates as you'd expect and as you noted, Toni, we're coming off a very strong issuance from the corporate sector in 2017 in really all regions. Just kind of tying this together, several factors influencing our overall issuance outlook this year. Linda touched on a few of these, but expanding global economy, this concept of synchronous growth across the G20, first time we've seen all G20 economies growing at the same time since 2010, modest geopolitical risks, firming in commodity prices, declining default rates that are supporting the tight spreads that Linda talked about and expect to see some robust M&A activity, which we think will help to offset some of the decline, the expected decline in the refinancing activity that we saw, particularly in the bank loan market last year.",,0.953
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,51,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"There are obviously some risks, namely the recent increase in market volatility and concerns about inflation and rate increases. Currently, our outlook hasn't really accounted for any kind of market disruption to issuance activity in 2018. We didn't have that in 2017. And then maybe as we take the issuance outlook and then build to the revenue guidance, so obviously, there are several factors that go into how that then translates into revenue.",,-0.318
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,52,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"First, the issuance forecast that I talked about, we also have some assumptions around mix, which you've heard us talk about on many of these calls, then new mandate activity, I'm happy to talk about the new mandate activity for the year at some point on the call. Recurring revenue growth from an increase in monitored ratings and I think this is important - this is about a third of our total revenue, the recurring revenue, you've seen some pickup in the recurring revenue growth rate over the last couple of quarters and that is due in large part to the growth in first-time issuers that we are now rating and then finally, kind of our standard pricing contribution and a bit of favorability from FX; that gets us there.",,0.927
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,53,Question,2018-02-09,4,2017,Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,,"That's great. And just for my follow-up, Linda, I think this is the question everyone wants to know, but what are your plans and what drove your decision to move on?",,0.372

So in RD&A, first, just to be clear about what's in and what's out, in 2017, there is no Bureau van Dijk in the - when we talk about organic RD&A for 2017. That includes no Bureau van Dijk. In the 2018 guidance, we do have, in the fourth quarter, Bureau van Dijk becomes organic, so we will have Bureau van Dijk in the 2018 numbers and reflected in our 2018 guidance for RD&A. So that's the - definitionally, that's what we're working with. Just to provide some color around the good - the very good results we're seeing in RD&A. I guess I'd just call out that we had a very solid low-double-digit underlying growth in the credit research and data businesses, which was a result of our work to improve upon and expand the content delivered to our CreditView platform and our data feed.",,0.939

Most of that is from the legacy Moody's Analytics business, with some additional contribution from Bureau van Dijk. So we're seeing good success as we continue to rigorously pursue our strategy to drive margin expansion in MA. You may note that we had no head count growth in Moody's Analytics next year. Ignoring the addition of the Bureau van Dijk staff, we literally had two more people working in Moody's Analytics at the end of 2017 compared with the end of 2016.

As we brought on the business, we had to do, with the BvD business, we had to move through a deferred revenue adjustment. We handled some of that in 2017 and some of that will remain in 2018, just so there is a bit more guidance for modeling purposes. We expect that there is about $16 million left of deferred revenue adjustment for Bureau van Dijk in 2018. Just so you have the detail quarter-by-quarter that lays out about $10 million in Q1, $5 million in Q2 and the rest in Q3. And I think we're done with that once we lap the close of the acquisition in August 2018.

I was wondering if you could speak on capital allocation a bit, what you plan to do with the proceeds from the tax savings. It seems like you'd probably just delever quicker and faster.

I think we announced when we took on the Bureau van Dijk business that with the $2 billion of debt we had added for that acquisition, our plans for 2017 and 2018 really centered on deleveraging after that deal. In 2018, we're planning to reduce our debt by about $500 million and we're ahead of schedule in that process because we are strong operating cash flow. We think our capital allocation priorities are going to remain about the same. We have some very good opportunities to invest in our business which will always be job one.",,0.855

So for Moody's, we may end up with a couple hundred million dollars of offshore cash to repatriate, but not a huge amount. So I think we're going to stick to our plans and continue to focus on deleveraging. And as I think Ray had mentioned, about $200 million of share repurchase on the docket for 2018. Ray may have something else, you might want to add.",,0.204

And then for a follow-up, could you just speak to MIS margins, down year-over-year in the quarter. I realize it's up strongly on a full-year basis, but this comes despite the strength in revenue growth. How much is driven by mix versus investments or just incentive comp and help us understand how these shape your outlook for that segment as it relates to your 48% margin guide for 2018? Thank you.",,0.924
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,74,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Sure. I'll start on this one. It's Linda. And in fact, the MIS operating margin did decline by 110 basis points, despite 19% growth in revenue in the quarter. And on the full-year basis, it's important to note that the MIS operating margin is up 190 basis points. So we had some unusual activity in the fourth quarter. We would really point you towards the full year as being more indicative. But in the fourth quarter, we kind of saddled Rob with some additional expenses here. As you know, we had very strong performance in the fourth quarter, so we had to increase our performance-based incentive compensation, our stock compensation and we had profit sharing in 2017. I think the total amount was a little over $10 million, so all of that hit MIS. The second thing that was important is we had a little bit of a severance charge in one of the non-U.S. businesses. All that comes to little bit less than $20 million or so. So, really just the result of very strong performance and one little item that we right-sized. But I think you should see the margins back to as Rob had described previously, but I'll let him follow up on this.",,0.727
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,75,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah. Maybe just to give a little color about what we're going to do to continue to drive on the margin. You've seen our results over the last several years; we're continuing to look for further efficiency in managing expenses in a disciplined fashion. So a couple of things I might just point to I think will support that. First, we just, this year, completed a reorganization of our junior staff into a dedicated support organization. That's going to help us manage our staffing more effectively through the inevitable ebbs and flows of issuance and drive up our resource utilization.",,0.952
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,76,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Second, we're leveraging technology in a variety of ways across MIS. We just launched our first bots in October as part of our Robotic Process Automation initiative and these bots are automating manual repeatable tasks that are currently being done by people. We're also developing workflow and analytical tools that are going to help the analysts be more efficient and spend their time focused on higher value-added activities. And the last thing I'd say is, we're hiring more staff in low-cost locations, like India, and we're looking to open an office in Costa Rica this year through MIS so that we can make sure we have the right jobs in the right places. In this past year, to give you a sense, about half of our head count growth was at our support center in India.",,0.952

I usually think when you give guidance in the beginning of the year, it's a bit conservative. And I guess there's a few areas, where I just need a little bit more help here.

We do have a mid-single [low-single] (00:40:52) digit revenue decline as our guidance. But we have a significant - we think that the U.S. public finance issuance is going to be significantly adversely impacted from the changes to the U.S. tax law; that's really around the loss of tax-exempt status for advanced refundings in U.S. public finance, which was, depending on the year ,somewhere between 20% and 30% of the market.",,0.162

And that also is going to touch on, I think, one of Toni's questions around the guidance around non-U.S. growth. So a really good story in the fourth quarter, 260 first-time mandates; that's up about 47% on the year-over-year quarter. So that took us above 1,000 new mandates for the year, it set a new record. We expect somewhere slightly below that number, but still another strong year for first-time mandate activity.

MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,87,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"And interestingly, as we look at the mix of first-time mandates and the growth, the European and Asian first-time mandates grew at a rate of growth that was about 2x first-time mandates in the United States.

We expect FX to have a 3% positive impact on revenue in 2018 and 3% positive impact on adjusted operating income. As you know, our main exposures are to the euro and the pound and we put a pin in it with the pound at $1.42 to the dollar, as Ray said, the euro at $1.25. And probably for your planning purposes, the rule of thumb here is that €0.01 decline in the euro takes about one $0.01 off our EPS and the £0.01 decline in the pound basically doesn't move our EPS all that much. So we're a little bit more sensitive to the euro and hopefully that will help you out. Yes, we do note that the currencies are moving around a bit.",,0.936

The expense ramp, as you know, can be very strongly impacted by timing of expenses, FX movements and as we saw this year, very strong late-period changes in incentive compensation. So $60 million, $70 million is given what we know now. But we'll look at that as we go through the year. So let's use a starting number for first quarter of 2018.

I think your point is well taken that that may weigh a little bit more heavily toward the first quarter.

I just wanted to speak a little bit more about incentive compensation because I think the detail would help. We had some very lumpy quarters for 2017. Incentive comp went $52 million, $51 million and then the third quarter was $83.4 million and then about $77 million in the fourth quarter. Within the third quarter, we added to incentive compensation $5 million of profit sharing for the employees worldwide and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter. So profit sharing requires that we put up some pretty good numbers in order to have that take effect, but again, a total of $10.5 million for profit sharing, which falls into incentive compensation for the third and fourth quarter.",,0.976

And there are puts and takes to the tax reform. Obviously, there's going to be repatriation of cash. There are the interest deductibility caps.

If you look at the futures, I think the markets are looking, as I said, for three interest rate increases with the first in March with an 80% plus probability on that. It's pretty important though that potential investors in Moody's take a look at times when this has happened before and we'd point you back to our investor deck. We've had periods where rates have gone up more than 100 basis points in a year. We often cite 2008 to 2009 when rates went up 100 basis points and then 2012 to 2013, rates went up 120 basis points.",,0.791

In both of those periods, MIS revenues went up.

So for us, if things move along as they are predicted to do, this could be very, very helpful for us, but we're going to have to see how things pan out and of course the present volatility is something we're keeping a close eye on. But as Robert said, the bond market's reaction to all of that has seemed to be relatively subdued as compared to the equity market's volatility. So, hope that helps you a bit.",,0.943

MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,131,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"In general, obviously rates are up, spreads have widened a bit, but I would say that the pipelines look steady and that's - everything that I'm hearing indicates that as Linda said, the market, the bond market took this a bit in stride. If you think about the spreads, they did move out about 25 basis points, but they were at kind of four-year tights before they did that. In the U.S., we've seen a deal or two postpone and I would say those were on the more aggressive end of structures. We've also seen some sizable deals get done this week and in this market, one recently for some acquisition financing. I think the general view is still constructive, at least that's what we're hearing now and issuers, I think, will continue to come to market if they have a financing need. What we may see is some of the opportunistic issuance taking a bit of a pause to wait on the market to digest some of this volatility.",,-0.591
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,132,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"And in Europe, I think a pretty similar story. You've got investors with very robust cash levels. The debt markets, I'd say they are perhaps being a bit more selective, but again, a pretty constructive tone is what we're hearing, the loan market there, a little bit slower to react to this volatility and we're seeing continued flow of primary issuance in the loan market.

Again, there were some products that we had planned to build and launch in Moody's Analytics that Bureau van Dijk already had a reasonably well developed product in that area.

Both of those businesses struggled a bit over the last couple of years. But we've done a number of things operationally to get them on track and early in 2017 or midyear 2017, they both sort of turned it around and we're starting to see good results coming out of both of those product lines. Customer attrition is down, new business production is up. So we're seeing good progress and good momentum in both of those businesses. You're also quite right.

Earlier in 2017, we turned over the Max business, which I have been running for two years to get it up to SOX compliance standards for U.S. public companies. We turned that over to someone in the - from the sales organization, in Mark's organization. And quite frankly, we've seen very nice results on the sales front as we've done that. Now, the business is operating very nicely within the Moody's framework and quite safely with a interesting journey from an Indian - two Indian private companies to a U.S. public company standard and then Mark's team has really turbocharged that on the sales front.

I'm going to go back to the beginning when Rob, I think, mentioned the strong issuance last year and how that could lead or should lead to higher recurring revenues in MIS this year. Can you put a little bit more meat around that? I think in past years when we've had strong issuance, I've seen that monitoring fees up in like the high single digits and obviously FX helped that too.

And again, it's the - yeah just because we have issuance doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have growth in recurring revenues because that issuance fee comes from existing issuers. So it's really, you really have to look at the growth of the first-time issuers, first-time mandates and that really is, I think, the best future indicator of recurring revenue growth.",,0.974

No, there is not any particular seasonality in the underlying business. So, I don't think you need to really think about that too much. And then on the business generally and the opportunities there, the business is performing well. We are - we have a Moody's Analytics executive now running the business and applying some of our processes and practices to the Bureau van Dijk business. But it's a good solid business and it continues to perform very well. It's not as though it was broken to begin with.

It should have a potential positive impact on our PPIF business. But of course that depends on how the final legislation is actually structured.

I have a few things to look for, I mean, obviously there's some - there's been some discussion about the infrastructure bill. Talking about $1.5 trillion, not large in the overall scheme of the U.S. economy, but it would be an increase - I think a significant increase over the current level of infrastructure spending in the United States. And I think we then want to look at the mix of federal versus state and local funding to understand that will have an impact on how that translates into issuance. And then another topic is around regulatory approvals and timeframes and how long will it take this infrastructure investment to actually make it to the market. I know there's been some discussion about shortening those approvals, but some are at the federal level and others are at the state and local level.",,0.916

Just post tax reform, any thoughts around changing how you think about how levered Moody's should be just given you convert a higher percentage of your EBITDA into actual cash income. And then just on the debt pay-down, I was looking at your guidance for $1.6 billion of free cash flow, looking at $500 million for dividends and buybacks, $500 million for debt pay down and then CapEx another $120 million, it still feels like you've got some extra dry powder there.

We don't like to be right at the edge on any of those things. But your observation is correct; we probably have a few hundred million dollars of potential additional dry powder if things continue as we're seeing now, which we could potentially use in another way. In terms of what we're going to do with interest pay down and then I'll let Ray add some further observations to this, we've got an additional $39 million in interest expense from BvD throughout 2018. That addition is $11 million in the first and second quarter and it kind of ramps down to $9 million and then $8 million in the third and fourth quarter, so probably going to prepay the most expensive debt first as you would probably imagine. So that's how you can probably take a shot at modeling that. But it was sort of like our leverage levels. We like to remain consistent and with a little bit of luck, we'll do perhaps a bit better than we had expected.

MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,167,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Sure. We were able to, for 2018, add about $150 million to free cash flow from the reduction in the tax rate, which is helpful. Might be interesting, Shlomo, to take a look at the increase in our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And we're moving from if I've got this right about $6.07 to a midpoint of a little over $7.70. I think what we have there is about $0.65 of that from U.S. tax reform, about $0.40 each from BvD and the business and maybe $0.15 coming from FX and other things.",,0.908
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,168,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"So $0.80 of our increase there is really coming from our business and the acquisition, $0.55 from tax reform and the rest from FX. In terms of the operating margin expansion, we also got the question about how much of that is from FX. So, if you look at that 70 basis points, only 10 basis points is from FX. So we're doing most of that the hard way. So, I hope that all of that is helpful to you in thinking about where we're going with 2018.",,0.784

And thanks, just as a follow-up, just a little on BvD, a prime competitor of theirs in Benelux was DNB and they sold that business to a private investor about a year and a half ago. Was there any change in competitive environment back then? I mean one of the reasons they sold was because they were being challenged by BvD. I want to know if the old DNB business has become more competitive for you guys over there.",,0.881

You'd talked about the strong organic growth there and some of the drivers, a nice pickup in the core research business. You also highlighted 2 to 3 points coming from one-time projects, and you also mentioned the BvD deferred revenue adjustment.

MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,182,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"Yeah, a continuation of the story we've been talking about for a while there and I guess there are really two pieces to it. There's the very intentional product strategy that we're pursuing, where we're moving away from a business that was driven rather substantially - where growth was driven rather substantially by lots of one-off project works that we were doing as large customers were asking us to install our software and configure it in a highly bespoke manner for them. We were moving away from that business. Now that we've established what I think is a pretty strong market position, moving away from that very customized kind of business to delivering much more standard product where we can sell a larger number of units ideally on a subscription basis and reduce the amount of low margin services work that we're undertaking.",,0.911
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,183,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"So we've got the services business declining, very intentionally. We're taking on less and less of that work and the product business is growing at a good clip. But as we make this transition from a services-led business to a product-led business, we have this period where the decline in services is offsetting the growth in profit. As we work through that more this year, that situation will start to stabilize and then we'll be growing off of a more stable base as we move into 2019.",,0.906
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,184,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"So that's one part of the story which I guess I would characterize as the idiosyncratic part of the story and then the market part of the story is that ERS was growing very, very well over the last number of years through 2016, driven heavily by new regulation that banks were dealing with around capital adequacy and liquidity and stress testing, et cetera.",,0.22
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,185,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,"Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"That regulatory wave has matured. We don't see nearly as much new regulation being placed on banks with respect to those kinds of issues. So the regulatory driver of demand has dissipated. And so we're also dealing with a softer market environment, at the same time that we are executing the shift in product strategy. So we have two things going on that is constraining growth in the ERS business.",,0.637
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,186,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.,,"Hey, Bill, it's Linda. Also in terms of other things we're doing to make Mark's life a little bit more tricky, you may've heard about the new accounting standard, Revenue Recognition Standard 606, we have to bifurcate software subscription licenses, that requires a lot of accounting work to reclassify some of these things. And near term, that's going to add a little bit more volatility, maybe a 1% negative on MA's overall results in 2018 as we move through that, that should smooth out as we get later on in the year, pretty technical set of changes, but just wanted to let you know that that is going on and it's something that all software companies have to adopt. You'll be seeing more detail on that as we release our 10-K.",,0.124

McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.",,"Yeah, I mean a large part of the story was the interestingly titled issuance from infrequent issuers in the fourth quarter and there was strength in that outside of the U.S. as well as inside the U.S. Rob, I don't know if there's more detail you have on that.",,0.681
MCO-2017-Q4-2018-02-09,192,Answer,2018-02-09,4,2017,Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.,,"Yeah, that's right. I mean in the U.S., it was across banks, insurance companies, cards, securities brokerages. In Europe, really driven by this continued issuance as part of the move towards building levels of bail-in-able capital as part of TLAC in the resolution regimes in Europe. So that's been kind of a full-year trend. And in Asia, we saw some good issuance from Chinese asset management companies, ASEAN. And we even saw some good issuance activity from our affiliate in Korea where there was a good bit of issuance from subsidiaries of foreign banks. So, like Ray said, a lot of issuance that tended to come from issuers who aren't hitting the markets frequently. As you know, Craig, there's a more relationship-based construct. And you can see our guidance, we would expect to move back to something that looks more like that in 2018.",,0.96

So obviously we've - as mark touched on we've got the same overall issuance outlook and the components to get to are our overall MIS low single-digit guide. As you said, we've increased our U.S. guidance and that's really around the our outlook for corporate bond issuance and the revenue expectations given the receptive environment that we're seeing. Some small upward revisions in our outlook for us project in infrastructure finance activity. And that's been partially offset by the downward revisions that we've got in us bank loans and CLOs.

Certainly the increasing in these total restructuring charges of $108 million was really due to the acceleration and expansion of our staffing and real estate optimization and some of the acquisition integration and that as you correctly note, that lead to an increase in our analyzed pretax savings amount of approximately $60 million.

And then conversely, leverage loans issuance has been down over 30% with acquisition financing driving for the majority of that activity.

And then of course those concerns are also being reflected in the market with the bifurcation and the demand for high yield credits sort of that preference towards the higher quality names. We turn to Europe, feedback from the banks is that the investment grade market, you've seen some of the rate dynamics to the U.S., but more accentuated.

But the biggest changes are really around corporate high yield bond issuance outlook for us from the first quarter, given all the activity in the pipeline that we're seeing. We're expecting to see some significant growth now in high yield issuance for the full-year. And then conversely, we've trimmed our outlook for bank loan issuance on really less opportunistic refi, and the fact that new issue loans spreads and yields are higher than a year ago.

As I mentioned earlier, that could lead to some elements of opportunistic supply more than we've anticipated. M&A is really going to be a key factor here.

In terms of our expectations for the second half of the year. But as we look at whether the second half of the year may include more significant pull forward.

MCO-2019-Q2-2019-07-31,105,Answer,2019-07-31,2,2019,Raymond W.

Europe I don't know that we will be seeing a pull forward historically that has not characterized the European market as much. And so whether the quantitative easing that is expected in Europe encourages more pull forward is a question we will have to just watch and see the answer to. And see how significant that is. A reminder that the spec-grade market in Europe is not of the same size as the U.S. market. So it would be less material even if there is pull forward.,0.0954663,0.791

And that's in contrast to the level of outflows that we had seen in high yield bond funds in something like five and over the last six years.

I was going to ask a different one, but we only get two here. So when Moody's goes in and rates a Chinese company, do they benefit typically the same way that a U.S. entity would benefit?

These scores allow our customers to screen ESG risks on public and private companies to monitor portfolio and supply chain risk and are a great example of integrating our SME and ESG capabilities to address a key market need, which is ESG assessment to support sustainable supply chains.",0.3684211,0.832

In the second quarter, MIS revenue increased 4%, supported by a 3% rise in transaction revenue, while global MIS rated issuance declined 16%. As a result of favorable mix, corporate finance revenue declined 4% versus a 26% decrease in issuance. This was attributable to a surge in leveraged finance activity as U.S. and EMEA issuers opportunistically refinance existing debt and funded M&A transactions. Investment-grade supply contracted compared to the prior year period, which had seen significant liquidity-driven financing caused by uncertainty over the unfolding pandemic.",0.4856278,0.494

This is due to infrequent EMEA bank issuers who sought to take advantage of the ongoing attractive rate environment.

Moody's outlook for 2021 is based on assumptions regarding many geopolitical conditions, macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; responses by governments, regulators, businesses and individuals as well as the effects on interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market.

Our guidance also assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast for the balance of 2021 reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.38 and $1.19 for the euro.

As always, we don't comment on any specific potential acquisitions or divestitures, and we won't comment on any deals that we are pursuing. We have not included the impact of any future acquisitions in our current outlook, but obviously, a transaction could affect our guidance depending on the terms of any deals that we are able to reach.

Third, we continue to integrate and embed our holistic E, S and G offerings within our products and solutions, enabling our stakeholders to manage an evolving set of risks.

We're now looking at low single-digit growth in global rated issuance. And obviously, that's an improvement from our outlook for low single-digit decline earlier this year.

And while issuance conditions, we expect to remain favorable, our outlook for the second half of the year assumes moderating issuance in leveraged finance in the second half.

I think last quarter you gave us some numbers, but I don't recollect. But I was just hoping that, obviously, there's a lot of ESG activity going on.

Second quarter ESG revenues were up just shy of 30% compared to the same period last year, and that reflects growth both on a stand-alone basis and also how we're integrating our ESG risk metrics and analytics into our MIS and MA products.

First on the commercial side, we saw very strong quarterly growth in climate, primarily bank stress testing and physical climate risk assessments for commercial real estate, corporate facility and infrastructure clients. We also saw very strong market demand for SPOs, and specifically for our SPO product, which has allowed us to drive success in that sustainable finance area. And then lastly, we've introduced on the commercial side a number of EU taxonomy offerings, which are going to really enable us to gain traction and have really supported some of the key wins we had in Q2.",0.4341906,0.952

The first is we launched the Regulatory Data Solutions, which has the SFDR principal adverse indicators. And that's really important because it's going to help investors with reporting obligations under the new EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. We've also introduced the climate-adjusted EDF. And that allows us to integrate directly climate scenarios, which are based on the network for the greening of the financial system into our banking and other EDF models. And then third is really the one that Rob spoke about earlier on the SME Predictor Score. This is something we're particularly proud of. We think it's a tool that's a first of its kind. It gives us a competitive edge. And most importantly, it really allows customers to access more than 140 million ESG scores, which are then integrated into our existing Moody's products like Orbis, like compliance, Catylist.",0.1436583,0.0

So really, the primary driver of our increase in full year 2021 adjusted EPS to sort of $11.70 at the midpoint of the latest guidance range is really the reflection of the actual and expected strong operating performance of MIS of 4% in the second quarter against what we thought is a very difficult prior year comparable.

There's this demand for greater precision and automation of customer vetting. And we've got this emerging demand for understanding supply chain resiliency alongside that. So all of that is, we talked about in the webcast driving kind of mid-20s growth in that KYC space. Credit research and data feeds, we have some very high retention rates for that credit research, lots of demand for the data feeds.

This is defined benefit pension plans in the kind of risk technology and portfolio design space. And that was really enabled by our acquisition of RiskFirst.

MCO-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,83,Question,2021-07-28,2,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"I wanted to ask about the ERS business. We've had about 3 straight quarters of low single-digit growth. And I know a lot of this is related to lower onetime sales. But I guess when does that fully get worked through?

MCO-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,84,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Toni, good to have you on the call. The key figure this quarter for ERS is recurring revenue growth, the recurring revenue growth rate. And that represented about 88% of total ERS revenue in the quarter. That's why we're so focused on that number. And recurring revenue in ERS was up 15% on an as reported basis and something like 9% on an organic constant dollar basis. And looking at the drivers of that recurring revenue growth, we had double-digit recurring revenue growth in both insurance and our risk and finance solutions. And I talked a bit just a minute ago about what's driving our growth in the insurance space. In risk and finance solutions, we've seen customers continuing to leverage a range of different offerings. We've got products, RiskCalc, RiskFrontier, all the support, credit loss reporting requirements and asset and liability and balance sheet management and our recent acquisition of ZM Financial enhanced that.",0.3666954,0.885
MCO-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,85,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Toni, you're right, so 15% recurring revenue, but overall revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. And that 15% recurring revenue growth was dampened by an almost 40% contraction in onetime business at ERS. And to the last part of your question, in regards to onetime revenue. I mean, we've got increasing customer preference for SaaS solutions. So that's naturally going to lead to a continued decline in our onetime revenue for the foreseeable future. That said, I would expect that the rate of decline for onetime revenue will decelerate in 2022 and eventually level off at some relatively de minimis level for our ERS business overall. We will still have some customers who want on-prem solutions, and we may decide to service that.

Slide 22 was really helpful with the bridge for the overall versus the prior guide and from last year's expenses. But when I look at it, first half MIS adjusted operating margins were 67%. You're guiding to, I think, 61% for the year. So that implies like 53% margins in the back half. So this is obviously way below last year's margins, and last year included some nonrecurring items like severance and some extra incentive comp, and I know you're building in sort of more incentive comp in second half.

And what we're seeing in Q2, which we're partly flowing through to our full year outlook, is again an increase in operating leverage above a normalized run rate, and that's driven by better-than-expected issuance volumes and mix. It's underpinned by the expense discipline that you're observing. And it's important to keep in mind that we are planning to deploy part of that operating leverage really towards strategic investments in the second half to advance ESG capabilities, our technology stack, and it's really for the benefit of our customers to do that. We expect those actions really will bring down the third and fourth quarter MIS margin, to your point, below the 61% that we're guiding to for the full year.",0.9553707,0.827

So if we think about combining some of the onetime costs and incentive comp, the key point that I'm making here is that the go-forward expense run rate for 2022 is going to look a lot more like the first half of this year than necessarily what we might see in the second half of this year.",0.7677761,0.0

But if post-Labor Day, we see financing costs and market conditions where they are now and a continuation of the kind of issuance that we have seen for the last few months, particularly in leveraged loans, that could present some upside.

We had a very strong third quarter last year as spreads have tightened, and that even continued into the fourth quarter, and we had a pretty strong end to the year. Any increase in equity market volatility, that leveraged finance activity is often correlated to equity market conditions and equity market volatility.

I'm curious about some of the proactive M&A commentary you've made in particular, the comment around larger bolt-ons. So I would love you to define some of that a little bit more. I mean, with BvD, I think you did the largest deal in history. But when you talk about larger bolt-ons, can you dimensionalize like how big something like this could be and what capacity you have? And then maybe related to that, it would be great if you can just remind us what you're looking for in terms of growth of some of these companies. You've done a great job doing some of these smaller deals and really accelerated them. But if you're talking about larger bolt-ons, I mean, is this something that also needs to accelerate the top line growth or is a lot of accretion, something that you care about?

I think of our acquisitions of RDC and Bureau van Dijk as a range of larger bolt-on deals.

And I don't think that it is going to impact our ratings business, but it has a broad scope, and the language of the law means it could impact other parts of our business as well as our customers and suppliers over time. But I guess I would say, Owen, that impact is going to depend on how we see these regulations being interpreted by the market and also how they're implemented by authorities.

So maybe let me just start by talking about structured finance in the quarter and then give you some sense of what's contributing to our outlook. Our second quarter structured finance revenue in MIS was up almost 75%. And securitization activity kind of across the board was just very elevated, as Mark talked about earlier, a very active market in CLOs in part because you've got, obviously, an enormous amount of leveraged loan supply but also a lot of refinancing activity, and that's refinancing even of the 2000 vintage given the tightening of spreads in the CLO market, something like 70% of CLOs in this past quarter were refi.",0.5431406,0.511

And overall issuance in RMBS remains quite strong across the board. Spreads are still tight. There's been a little bit of widening recently due to all the supply, but nothing, I think, particularly immaterial. And in terms of talking to bankers in this space, Craig, we're hearing they don't see many signs of this softening or slowing down. Obviously, we're going to want to wait and see as we get through the kind of what will probably be a little bit slower August. But overall, ABS fundamentals are expected to continue to improve. We just got a lot of pent-up demand in that space and a general improvement in economic activity.

And that's going to be offset by a combination of M&A that we've already done and organic investments that we've done and we plan to do of around 140 basis points that sort of gets us to that midpoint of 1 20.

MCO-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,174,Question,2021-07-28,2,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Mark, I wanted to go back to costs for a second here. once we hopefully get past this COVID-19 environment here, can you give us some help on how to think about your annualized costs that you think will come back in the system in terms of employees fully back in the office? Or how are we going to do that in terms of T&E expenses? So is it sort of like a $100 million rough number that will come back in the system once we get through this pandemic versus what we're tracking at right now?",0.6040091,0.87

So first half of the year, we saw operating expenses effectively up 5% year-over-year. And within that 5%, the underlying operating expenses, excluding M&A and FX, were effectively flat. And the reason for that was really because of some of the programs that we've implemented, which does include some T&E savings, but think about the 2020 real estate rationalization program, savings from the 2020 MA restructuring plan, which ended this quarter, the offshoring initiatives that we've engaged in really holding those operating expenses for the first half of the year effectively to 2-0 percent.",0.6645234,0.66
MCO-2021-Q2-2021-07-28,177,Answer,2021-07-28,2,2021,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"M&A was about 3% and then FX was about 2%, and that's how you get to that 5% number for the first half of the year. Contrast that to the second half of the year, we are looking for operating expenses, excluding M&A and FX, to really try to -- to really accelerate -- and if we think about the mid-single-digit guide that we provided this morning, about half of that is really due to that underlying core operating expense growth. M&A is probably 2-ish percent of that and maybe FX maybe 1%. And so that gets us to really the expense ramp for the year. And we're looking at somewhere between $80 million to $90 million, and that would take into account all the additional incentive compensation accruals and any accelerated organic initiatives, investments in the second half.",0.6940242,0.077

You have T&E where you think is a reasonable level -- I'm assuming it's not going to get back 100% where it was pre-pandemic, but it's not going to be 0. If you add those two nuggets together, it's an extra roughly $100 million. How should we think about that in your mind or roughly 3% of cost?",0.4958396,0.455

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","During full year 2018, Moody's achieved strong results, driven by robust performance of Moody's analytics, prudent expense management and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate offsetting weaker than expected global debt issuance in the fourth quarter. Full year 2018 adjusted operating margins increased across the corporation, including at both Moody's Investor Service and Moody's Analytics. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, Moody's total revenue declined 9%.

As you can see in the charts on Slide 7, adjusted operating margin increased in both MIS and MA by over 150 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The restructuring charge we took in the fourth quarter of $49 million exceeded our previously announced range of $30 million to $40 million due to the acceleration of staff reductions and acquisition integration, which together also allowed for real estate rationalization. Our total restructuring program is now expected to be in the $70 million to $80 million through the first half of 2019.

Notably, there was no U.S. high yield bond issuance activity in December. Even with these challenges, economic fundamentals remain sound in developed markets with stable U.S. and European economic growth and unemployment rates at multiyear lows. The drop in global debt issuance of almost 30% in the fourth quarter of 2018 led to a smaller decline in MIS revenue of 18%, demonstrating the strength of the business model.

This year's revenue outlook is supported by 12% growth in 2018 sales of subscription products, which lifted aggregate ERS sales by 6% despite 10% decline in sales of one-time software licenses and services. The acceleration in total ERS sales growth since early 2018 indicates that we've worked through the inflection point in the SaaS transition. Importantly, the expansion of our subscription business enhances the profitability of ERS, contributing to our expectation of further improvement in MA's adjusted operating margin in 2019.

These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could defer materially from our current outlook.

I will mention a few key items now. For MIS, we believe that stable economic fundamentals of GDP growth of 2% to 3% in the U.S. and 1% to 2% in Europe will underpin global debt issuance activity. However, market volatility may moderate the pace of new mandates includes their ability in annual global debt issuance. For MA, product innovations will unable sustained core RD&A growth. ERS revenue growth should resume as the transition from licenses and services to SaaS based product has passed the inflection point. We remain on track to achieve our Bureau van Dijk run rate synergy targets of approximately $45 million by year end 2019. As Ray outlined earlier, companywide, annualized pretax savings as a result of our restructuring activities are now anticipated to be in the $40 million to $50 million range with an estimated pretax savings of $30 million to $35 million in 2019.

We also expect moderating M&A, new CLO formations and refinancing of leverage debt. The chart on the right shows our forecast for slower pace of the new mandates in 2019 relative to the past two years. These headwinds will be partially offset by an expanding global economy, deployment of investor cash balances and low credit defaults.

We project that capital market conditions will be more constructive than in the fourth quarter of 2018, but believe that the full year 2019 market environment will be more difficult on average than 2018. Overall, we see positive economic fundamentals, moderating declines in M&A and refinancing activity.

We have seen healthy U.S. investment grade issuance activity and the return of U.S. speculative grade issuers to the markets, following a historically slow December month. We will continue to monitor monitory policy along the other macro and geopolitical factors affecting the credit market. We expect MIS adjusted operating margin to be approximately 58% in 2019. We will manage our expense base and implement technology to increase efficiency in our ratings processes. However, we also have to account for a reset of the incentive compensation pulled back to 100% assuming of course we meet our full year operation targets.

We anticipate broad based strength across all product areas and businesses. The drag from FX will be offset by the acquired gross from Omega Performance and Reis thus constant dollar organic growth is also projected to increase in the low double digits percent range. We anticipate MA adjusted operating margin increasing 250 to 350 basis points, the 29% to 30% range in 2019.

What does that mean for the issuance environment? So that would be super helpful? Thank you.",,0.805

As we think it's important to give both the bank perspective from what we're hearing, as well as our internal view. In terms of bank feedback that we're hearing for both U.S. and Europe and in particular for the U.S., there are three key points that are being quite pervasive. The first is capital market conditions have obviously improved since December, but issuance activity has remained relatively modest thus far. And we are anticipating or at least banks are anticipating large cap cash repatriated to retrench the market in late 2019, and that would certainly help investments grade. And then lastly in relation to the U.S., M&A still is a driver of issuance activity in 2019, but the banks expect us to be down from elevated 2018 levels.",,0.838
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,38,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Mark Almeida,,"In terms of what we are hearing from the banks in terms of feedback for Europe, a hard Brexit does remain a potential driver of downsize. Overall, investor demand does remain healthy but there is some concerned redemand for Baa2 or below issuance following the ECB's halt of corporate sector repurchase program. And then lastly from the banks in relation to Europe, strong reverse, the Yankee issuance and it's possible due to favorable relative value dynamic of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.",,0.948
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,39,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,RobFauber,,"And so maybe, Mark, let me add on to that and Toni, then triangulating to that flat to down 5% outlook, so there's a few components of that that go into our overall build. So starting with corporate finance, there we're expecting some slight declines in the investment-grade space, modest declines in bank loans and we think that'll be driven in part by less opportunistic refinancing. The U.S. high-yield market, we actually think we may see an increase in issuance there given the spread tightening from the fourth quarter where the yield curve is and also some very, very light 2018 comparables. As Mark mentioned, M&A we think will still be an important issuance driver, but we don't think it's going to be down off of 2018. 2018, I think is the third strongest year on record. So we think that'll be down something in the neighborhood of 10% or so.",,0.718
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,40,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,RobFauber,,"For financial institutions, we'd expect issuance to be slightly lower, in part, you may remember from the earnings calls through the course of this last year us talking about European banks, building up levels of bail-in-able capital, so we actually think that that's going to slow down and will provide some headwind to financial institution issuance.",,-0.228
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,41,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,RobFauber,,"We also had some very strong M&A driven issuance out of the insurance sector in the past year. Well, moving on to the PPIF segment, here we actually think we'll see some moderately higher issuance and that's driven primarily by the growth in issuance out of the U.S. public finance sector, and you may recall that was effectively the issuance there was effectively rebased after the loss of all that advanced refunding volume in 2018 that was associated with the tax law changes.",,0.915
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,42,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,RobFauber,,"And we're actually seeing some good activity in terms of new money transactions there. And finally in structured finance, looking at kind of a modest decline, driven really primarily by our outlook on CLO activity we've had now two years of very strong, not only new CLO formation, but a lot of refi activity. And so we think that this decline in CLO activity is going to be somewhat offset by increases in some of the other sectors really that are underpinned by economic growth. And then we triangulate all this obviously with the Wall Street banks and we think this is pretty consistent with the outlooks across the street.",,0.899

So obviously, if we do any more M&A activity, we would be looking for the same rationalizations. Beyond that though, we've been very focused on what we can do as far as onshore and offshore labor and what we can do with automation and robotic processes. Those will be part of the story going forward for us as I think they will for obviously many firms. And so there will be opportunities in the future, but in terms of a large restructuring action, I don't think we're going to be a serial restructurer, we're going to be looking for efficiencies and opportunities outside of formal restructurings.",0.2030962,0.933

And I know it's a difficult question to answer, but you think about the last few years I think you've gotten a reputation to be very conservative, and then at the end of the day, the market was just a lot better and you have outperformed, and most recently, obviously if you just look at the fourth quarter which was I know once in a blue moon environment, but clearly it was completely different than what everybody had thought.

So I've been dealing with over the past years I've been dealing with the fact that we have underestimated and overestimated, and we're trying to focus you and ourselves on things that are more in our control and those things that are more predictable. That being said, we have done a lot of work in support of the outlook that we put out at the MIS level, there will always be more uncertainty around MIS than I think we have around Moody's Analytics, because it is very Capital Market-sensitive, and so there are just externalities driving that business that are themselves cyclical.",0.2981939,0.512

If we see some real spread tightening and that's obviously continuation of the trend that we've seen in January, I mean, that could attract some more opportunistic issuance and more refinancing activity that would obviously be positive.

I know this is a small business but when you went through the kind of outlook more specifically on the public side you mentioned that you still see a little bit very robust I guess come back in 2019.

Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how that takes place.",,0.55

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe, I'm glad you asked the question because I think it's important to emphasize that when we talk about the growth in global debt as being roughly in line with GDP, we are talking about over multiyear periods. There is certainly going to be dislocations and variations on a short-term basis, so we have to deal with that, and I really wouldn't talk about growth in debt being aligned with GDP in this quarter or even necessarily in 2019. I don't know if my colleagues have anything they want to add to that, but it's a long-term metric.",0.3203096,0.519

Are you canceling projects, or rewriting contracts? Is there a certain percentage that are converting or not converting?

MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,86,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Mark Almeida,,"Sure. I mean, it's really a question of product strategy where we have migrated our product from what was previously a traditional software licensing and implementation services business, to much more of standard product typically delivered in a hosted environment, that is typically on the cloud where we are allowing customers to subscribe to those products. The works that we have to do to implement the product to put it into production for a given customer is simpler, it's cheaper for the customer, it's cheaper for us, doesn't take nearly as much time nearly as much customization.",,0.318
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,87,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Mark Almeida,,"So it's really migrating from what has been traditionally lots of customization of products from customer-to-customer installed on the customer's equipment behind their firewalls. So everything was quite bespoke. And moving to again much more standard product where all customers have access to the same code base, so it's very consistent with our mantra of, Build once, sell many times, sell it on a subscription basis so you have a recurring revenue.",,0.0
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,88,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Mark Almeida,,"So it's really not, I mean there is some migration of customers from old installed product to new hosted product sold on a subscription basis, we do have that in certain areas and that's a process that takes place over a period of time, but a lot of this is just -- frankly it's consistent with what customers want. Customers are demanding this, they're expecting this increasingly and this is how our customers want to buy software solutions from people like us. So it's really adapting our product offering to the needs of the market, and frankly that just -- that fits very well with our desire to run the business on a more of a subscription basis where we find the economics much more attractive.",,0.946
MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,89,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Mark Almeida,,"So the transition from the old to the new is a little cumbersome, and you get results that we saw in 2018 where the run-off in the old software licensing and services business preceded the ramp up in the revenue growth from the growing base of subscriptions that we've got. But again, when we say we're through that -- through the transition or through the inflection point, we feel like the decline in the one-time revenues will now be slower than the ramp up in the acceleration in revenue from subscriptions.",,0.7

MCO-2018-Q4-2019-02-15,102,Answer,2019-02-15,4,2018,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"So this is Rob, new mandates, they did decelerate in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and something in the range of about 10%, and versus the fourth quarter of 2017, they were down close to 20%. Now that's not nearly as sharply as the decline in the leverage finance markets around the world, and it was interesting. So despite the slowdown we had, 2018 was a very strong year for first-time mandate acquisition, actually we exceeded the prior year by I believe two first-time mandates, now not all of these first-time mandates ended up topping the market because of the disruption at the end of the market.

We've talked about before that the limits on interest deductibility really would only have an effect at the low end of the respective grade range, and even then it only has a modest impact. So it certainly didn't discourage issuance in the first half last year by low-rated issuers, and then in terms of cash repatriation that's pretty concentrated with large investment grade credits particularly in the tech area, again does not have much of an impact on spec-grade because they don't have large cash pools overseas for the most part.

If you look at investment-grade issuance in the United States and this is to the tax repatriation issue from 2015 to 2017 there's big large offshore cash holders representing something like a quarter of U.S. investment-grade issuance. It was a big number that essentially all dried up in 2018, and the 15 largest cash holders closed out 2018 really without accessing the bond market in any meaningful way. And they've raised something like $130 billion in 2017, and we're not expecting in our-- the outlook that we're particular we're not expecting issuance out of that group in 2019.",2.1570319,0.856

So I'll address the tax rate question first. 2018 effective tax rate was 21%, and that was probably lower especially in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 really driven by non-U.S. earnings and lower U.S. taxes on the release of an IRS notice that clarified certain elements of the U.S. Tax Reform. For 2019, we are guiding to 21% to 22% which is higher than the actual tax rate in 2018, and we're doing that primarily because of the expectation of lower excess tax benefit. Now, you'll recall in 2018 in the first quarter that around $38 million of excess tax benefit that we anticipate probably having half of that this year in 2019 and that's really what's driving the higher guided tax rate in 2019 compared to the actual rate in 2018.",1.3127837,0.785

MCO-2018-Q1-2018-04-28,41,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Robert Scott Fauber,Chief Operating Officer,"Yes, so your first question was around recurring revenue. So somewhere to the fourth quarter among other things we saw increases in monitored credits, particularly in Europe and Asia where we have seen some very strong first time mandate growth and we have also got a modest benefit from FX. And if you recall we had over 1,000 first time mandates in 2017, so that's helping to support the current revenue growth. And I think your second question was around corporate generally. So looking at corporate issuance globally it was down somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% on this CFT revenues. Whereof we benefitted from some favorable mix, some good commercial execution, the higher new mandates that I mentioned, monitored credit growth and FX. We also saw some good growth in other transaction revenue and that includes our rating adjustment service that's typically driven by M&A activity and the rest of world issuance declines were largely confined to the European investment grade issuers which mitigated the revenue impact to some extent.",1.6264021,0.99

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Overall conditions remain stable and fundamentals remain relatively strong and we are seeing a solid pipeline out front this week. For instance another was around 20 billion of investment-grade, I think calling next week or slightly higher than that as earnings blackout start to roll-off in May which is typically a fairly active month as from what we're hearing is shaping up to be so. Credit spreads have widened in the first quarter given equity market volatility but rallied a bit in April. The Barclays, Bloomberg aggregate bond index is roughly 10 basis wider here today.

Moving to high yield the forecast for full-year volumes 275 billion that's about flat to 2017, every market volatility and interest heights we've obviously seen one so far this year.

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Issuance today is primarily have been driven by refinancing and high yield bond market but demand from investors remained strong and on the close I would say a similar story as to investment grade in terms of the joining has been taken year-to-date given the and tightening in January and selling off in February and March and then some rallying over the last several weeks but year-to-date relatively unchanged in credit spreads volume of bonds.,1.4710652,0.796

Again this is flat to down 10% on what was really just a game buster to the year this asset class in 2017, so a very high base. As the leverage loan market does remain strong as we now know and is obviously an attractive asset class in a rising rate environment. Repricing and refinancing activity this still remains robust that was with regard to last year and we're seeing that trend continue. Full-year 2018 expected to be slightly down as I mentioned somewhat was directed through that 2017 with some potential upside if we see M&A activity accelerate or rising rates create more demand for floating rate base than we already think.",2.7268706,0.928

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Moving to Europe on the investment grade side issuance has picked up in the beginning of the year. The demand remained solid as [we are hoping]. The spreads have moved a bit wider from the beginning of the year but remain tight by historical standard so similar dynamics to what we are seeing on the U.S. dollar spread investment grade. Bureau van Dijk continues to see strong growth in GDP and corporate profits. So that's the happy condition.,0.1238481,0.969

I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on what you are thinking about doing with the free cash flow?

We have been very upfront really since we announced the Bureau van Dijk acquisition that our near term priority would be deleveraging from the debt that we took on to finance that acquisition. But we haven't come off of that, as you know we took our share repurchase target for 2017 to 200 million, 2018 the same amount and that's enough to offset dilution from employee shares issuance. So we are still marching along those same times. To the extent that we are able to reach our leverage targets sooner than we expected, I'd say at this point we are a bit ahead of pace than we had initially thought, then we will [fortunately] to reevaluate over the months there.

MCO-2018-Q1-2018-04-28,55,Question,2018-04-27,1,2018,Toni Kaplan,Morgan Stanley,"And then for Moody's Analytics, we noticed that the margins were -- it was about 20 basis points -- were up about 200 basis points but they are down sequentially from -- for the second half of '17.

MCO-2018-Q1-2018-04-28,57,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Mark Almeida,,"Yes, Toni we did have what we thought was good year-on-year margin expansion and moreover, we have got another quarter of margin expansion on a trailing 12 months basis. So I think that's five consecutive quarters now that on a trailing 12 months basis the margin is expanding. And that's really the number that we focused on because you can get some weird things going on with the numbers if you look at anyone discreet quarter. But the margin expansion is coming from both the legacy business as well as from Bureau van Dijk.

I think a lot of people were surprised this morning by the revenue performance and RD&A and in particular on BVD. So maybe you can talk about it a little bit more why maybe some of us got that wrong in terms of the seasonality and how does it all ramp all throughout the year?

What you are missing there is that we did take a hit to the top line in the first quarter because of the transition to the new accounting standard ASC 606. That did hurt us on the top line. We also had some timing delays in closing some of our renewal contracts that really relates to operational matters as opposed to commercial matters. We don't have issues with the customers or with the business but we just didn't get some of those contracts booked in the first quarter as expected. But we expect to get them shortly and we will see an acceleration like a catch up on the revenue recognition once we get those booked. So that's what going on there.",,0.329

As Ray said it's very much in line with if not better than the historical standalone performance of the business. So we feel very good about what's happening there. And then on the other point, I think that what you're seeing is that we do expect RD&A's growth rate to accelerate, particularly in the second half of the year. You need to keep in mind that what's happening here is that as we get into the third quarter, Bureau van Dijk numbers will start to roll into our organic calculations, because we will have them in the half of the third quarter and the full fourth quarter of '17. And as Steve just pointed out that deferred revenue haircut will go away. So we're willing to see very healthy growth in the organic RD&A figures as we get into the second half of the year.",,0.877

And then secondly just quickly, I think when you gave the update on the issuance outlook, leverage loans was still cited as an area of strength and I think you colleagues said this yesterday too with flows to bond funds and demand for variable paper. But LIBOR has certainly been coming up a lot, so while spreads are tight in this demand, like what about the corporate side?

But as we're making progress in getting them with the program and getting that work done the way we get it done across Moody's Analytics but we haven't quite gotten them to the level that we'd like. So that's really what I was referring to. It's not a massive amount of business but it does affect our numbers a little bit in the first quarter.

We have estimates of excess tax benefit related to the stock comp accounting of roughly 40 million for the year and we said that it was obviously [weighted] towards the first quarter. In fact it was about 35%, 30 million was taken in the first quarter, there's 10 or so remaining of it fairly evenly spread out. So that was one piece that was impacting the tax rate. Another item that you really wouldn't have visibility into but there was an alternate benefit that we received in the first quarter from the statute limitations expiration on certain of that tax to uncertain tax positions that we have a reserve for. So we reversed those out, so that further brought down the ETR. So going forward Jeff, obviously 14.6% in Q1 we haven't changed our guidance of 22% to 23% so the math would indicate that it's going to likely have to be slightly higher than that 22% to 23% for the remaining quarters in order to average out to the 22 to 23 guidance.",0.4226302,0.626

MCO-2018-Q1-2018-04-28,117,Answer,2018-04-27,1,2018,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I think broadly speaking, we do feel that we are able to attract very talented IT professionals whether it's in our centralized IT function or embedded in the businesses. A lot of this is how attractive the opportunity is, in terms of what we would have people working on, whether it's robotic process automation or product development, it is an attractive offering. You're correct that there is a lot of competition for the best people. So we've got to stay on top of that. We will adjust to make sure that we continue to retain our best people and recruit the best people and those adjustments they maybe financial, they maybe in terms of job content. But we're paying attention to it like almost any organization today would. Mark do you want to add to that.",1.1271655,0.988

Certainly it's quite challenging if you are recruiting in San Francisco and New York City and some other major centers. But we've got operations in many different place around the world. We've got a big operation in Omaha for example and we find there to be a terrific source of talent. And in many of our other operational centers around the world we are able to attract the kind of talent we want.

So for the first quarter, incentive comp was 45 million, that was down 13% from first quarter of last year and 37% sequentially. As you know we had to take that up pretty significantly in the back half of '17 as we raised guidance given the performance of the business. Going forward I would say sort of a 50ish number is probably the best way to think about. But as you know that will likely change depending on how the business performs, depending on what we do with guidance, but that I think is probably the starting point.",0.2292994,0.852

I mean I think we have got a number of new product launches that we put in to the market recently that have been very well received. Our new loan origination product is doing quite well. The product that we have in the market to help our customers comply with the new seasonal accounting standard is being very well received. We have a very nice pipeline building there.

First we had some pretty significant FX benefit which is obviously impacting the business outside the U.S. Also we had some very strong sales growth outside the U.S. in -- particularly in ERS last year related to work that we were doing associated with our customer's adoption of the IFRS 9 accounting standard.

So the numbers -- if you look at the dollars you might think it provides more of a headwind to our business than in fact it is. And I would just add that with so much of our business being in the spec grade sector those are not companies that typically have a lot of overseas cash to bring back.

But a couple of things while I'm here I guess. One, I know you don't really give near term guidance but would be interested with the commentary you have said in terms of the updated outlook how you think about more near term? I mean the first quarter has -- I mean on the MIS side, had a little bit of volatility, some of the this volatility has persisted. But typically the second quarter gets a little bit of a seasonal bump from the 1Q. So I'm just wondering if you feel like seasonally the second quarter should be stronger than 1Q just given seasonality, maybe some things were delayed and they are coming in the second quarter or is it just too uncertain of an environment?

So I'm going to talk a little bit about kind of the pipeline in market terms and kind of what we are seeing and what's happening. I think in general I'd say the pipelines look healthy. I'd note that we have worked through a good bit of the big M&A backlog that we had earlier in the year but we are also seeing M&A deals in kind of preliminary stages and we are seeing that through our rating assessment service. We have also got a very good pipeline of first time mandates. So that gives us some visibility.,2.1555474,0.768

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have talked about in spec rate market, spreads remain very tight and as I said we are seeing a lot of low rated issues tapping the market, a very strong CLO bid for that kind of paper. I'd also note just in terms of fund flows, so on the high yield side after we saw a lot of outflows earlier in the year we are starting to see some inflows back in the high yield funds. We saw 3 billion inflows last week. That was the largest week since mid-December 2016. And on the loan side inflows continue to be strong. We have had now nine consecutive weeks of inflows. So I think we expect on the investment grade side we are coming out of blackouts, we are seeing good activity and I think we expect steady issuance here in the second quarter.",0.4213048,0.84

I know you are pretty busy integrating BVD still but just curious about appetite right now as you look at the world and maybe also what the environment is like for deals in areas that you are interested in?

We have an active corporate development function at Moody's, M&A function. We look at a lot. As you know, we don't pull the trigger very often. So there are things that we are looking at that are of interest to us but it would be the same thing I would answer in any other quarter. There is nothing unusual going on in the M&A environment that is causing us to either step back and say it's too rich for us or to say we've got to act right now.

And while FX has been favorable compared to 2017, it is unfavorable compared to our beginning of the year and Q1 assumptions for exchange rates.

Our updated forecast is now using what are currently spot rates of $1.17. So, $1.25 rather, then condensed to $1.17. So $0.08 have come off the euro since we've put out our guidance in February.

Can you maybe just give us a little bit of a sense where you may be a little bit more conservative in your outlook, where you may have more or less visibility? The thing in particular that some investors have brought up to me today that they thought structured finance you should have had a little bit more room to revise the guidance there.

When I look at the adjusted numbers, meaning adding back the revenue recognition math, I think, A, last quarter was 83.5 million and you did 86 million this quarter, which is I think if you analyze it, it's nice double-digit growth, but you also had FX work against you, and I think last quarter you had something slip.

If the markets continue to perform as they have, however default rates are expected to remain low, our forecast for default rates has been declining on a 12 months forward basis.

Again, I'd remind you to look at our adjusted operating margin on a trailing 12-months basis rather than looking at discrete quarters because it's not unusual to have a little bit of idiosyncrasy on the expense line in any given quarter.

The implication would be then as we cycle through the deferred revenue issue in the second half, we should see a pretty dramatic step-up in terms of the year-to-year and I guess quarter to quarter margin performance. So something, from what you said earlier, it sounds like something like 500 basis points perhaps of incremental margin specifically from BVD, so that was point one. Point two then is, maybe I'm remembering incorrectly, but I thought that BVD pre-acquisition was closer to 50% margin.

We knew there was work that we were going to have to do, particularly in the short run, but the nature of the business is such, and this was Ray's point, the nature of the business is such that there is an awful lot of operating leverage to be realized as we accelerate the growth on the top line. We've seen good top line acceleration, as I mentioned earlier, and we feel very confident about sustaining that over the coming years.

Specifically, the costs of developing software were capitalized under IFRS and they are expensed under GAAP. It doesn't meet the criteria.

MCO-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,128,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark E. Almeida,,"Yes, Tim, it's Mark. It's very much as Steve described earlier on the call. The situation as we make this transition from selling traditional software sold on a perpetual license basis and doing these large implementation projects moving more to a SaaS model, what we're seeing is the trade-off there is that the first year fees when you're selling on a subscription basis are just at a much lower level than the fees we would have been realizing if we were selling on a perpetual license basis. Now, we make that up over a couple of year period because we are charging those subscription fees year in and year out, so over a three or four-year period we're even and then we pull ahead after that.",,0.128
MCO-2018-Q2-2018-07-27,129,Answer,2018-07-27,2,2018,Mark E. Almeida,,"So, as that transition is occurring, what we're seeing is that the decline in those one-time fees is happening a little bit more quickly than we're seeing the ramp-up in the subscription fees. So it's really just the timing thing of not getting the one-time fees and not realizing the subscription fees at quite the same pace that we had based our guidance on. So, as I said, that's a couple of million dollars on the ERS line, and so that together with the FX impact has caused us to bring down the outlook there.",,0.0

It's interesting that when we look at what issuance did last year, we saw actually a fairly meaningful deceleration in bank loan issuance in the second half of 2017 from the first half of 2017.

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With respect to leverage levels, again, we are not seeing anything that would indicate a dramatic increase in leverage. To your point though, Craig, the markets have definitely been open for increasingly lower rated credits.

That was an area that we identified as a potential synergy, given our customer relationships in those markets being deeper than those of Bureau Van Dijk, our brand having more resonance and recognition among customers in those markets than was true with Bureau Van Dijk. So, we've had some very nice sizable wins in both markets and we feel very good about what's happening there.

Bureau Van Dijk had a product, has a product that competed with a product that we offer in ERS. We have joined forces there. One of the big wins we had in Asia recently was where we went to market with a joint proposal offering both the Moody's Analytics option as well as the Bureau Van Dijk option, and we had a very successful win there.

I think we are making good progress there, again, both on reaching out to the market, getting in front of our customers, by our customers I mean Moody's Analytics relationships, introducing them to the product, applying some of both the Moody's Analytics knowhow to that product and adding some new features and functionality to the product.

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Before reviewing our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to provide a recap of how COVID-19 affected the credit markets. The virus has had a starkly negative impact on the global economy, resulting in widespread rising unemployment in recessionary conditions. In response, governments have undertaken unprecedented global monetary easing efforts and fiscal actions. While we've seen market disruption, we've also observed somewhat of the dichotomy between the impact of these macro shocks on the real economy, and the functioning of the credit markets. For instance, investment grade companies have responded to economic uncertainty by bolstering their cash balances and capital positions, with record levels of bond issuance in March and April. On the other hand, we've observed substantial spread widening in speculative grade issuance markets, and leverage finance activity curtailed as the contagion intensified.",1.0998894,-0.511

McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The high-yield bond market has begun to reopen, especially at the higher end of the speculative grade rating scale, while the leveraged loan market has been slower to recover. Nevertheless, the banking system has remained stable, allowing for a wave of borrowings under revolving credit facilities by corporates seeking liquidity. We have seen similar trends outside the corporate sector, and that higher rated names, notably financial institutions, have retained access to the credit markets, and use that access to bolster liquidity. We've seen a slowdown in structured finance activity, notably in CLOs, as spreads widen during March, given underlying credit concerns. U.S. public finance was also active early in the first quarter, yet issuance slowed as funding rates escalated.",1.7279764,0.904

I'd like to further highlight the progression of corporate issuance over the course of the first quarter. As you can see, leverage finance was relatively active early in the quarter, given tight spreads and healthy investor demand. However, issuance tapered as high-yield spreads significantly widened in March to exceed 1,000 basis points, levels not seen since 2009. The simultaneous surge in investment grade activity drew a contrast, as March issuance more than doubled from the prior year period.

I will begin by discussing how the rapidly evolving events over the last several weeks have affected Moody's outlook for 2020. Since our investor call on March 11, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, leading to the implementation of shelter-in-place policies across most of the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific. With the shutdown at non-essential businesses and reduced staffing needs across many sectors, over 30 million Americans have now filed for unemployment. This economic disruption has materially impacted the normal functioning of markets, and added extreme points so far.

With the net effect of these indicators, we have selectively revised downward our 2020 base case assumptions to reflect a more adverse operating environment. Specifically, our base case scenario assumes that economic activity will remain relatively weak into the third quarter and possibly fourth quarter. We currently assume 2020 U.S. and European GDP to decline 5.7% and 6.5% respectively, the U.S. full-year unemployment rate to be approximately 10%, benchmark rates to stay low with high-yield spreads remaining in excess of 700 basis points, and high-yield default rates to be between 11% and 16%.",0.7428139,0.802

MIS's internal forecast calls for investment grade issuance to increase 10% with a 20% decline in high yield and a 40% decline in bank loans. We assume that liquidity driven issuance will continue. However, fewer M&A financings will reduce total rated issuance. Additionally, we expect there to be a lower proportion of infrequent issuer activity, leading to a less favorable mix of issuance. The stable recurring revenue base, along with cost discipline, will provide balance to the margin for these downwardly revised revenue drivers.

This provides a future base for issuance, although the recent surge in investment grade issuance has likely steepened the last few years of these charts and resulted in new maturities begun the time periods we show here. Furthermore, as I previously indicated, speculative grade default rates are likely to increase, and these refinancing amounts may be reduced or the time periods delayed as a result.",0.5635401,0.612

However, due to the disruption from COVID-19 related social distancing guidelines, we have curtailed in-person sales meetings, and as a result, have prudently included an impact to renewal yields and new sales development in our forecast. I'd like to highlight here that MA has had a stable history of strong retention rates between 94% and 96% since 2012, and its track record of retaining customers spans multiple products and services. Research, ERS, and BvD all had retention rates of 92% or higher in 2019.

In recent years, we have been actively managing our expense base, and our guidance increased to $60 million benefit related to the restructuring plan we completed in mid-2019. We also assumed $30 million in additional cost savings from increased utilization of lower cost locations, M&A synergies, and improved process efficiencies through technology. As you can see on the bottom chart, the guidance we provided during the Investor Update Call on March 11 was for an increase in expenses in the low single-digit percent range, rather than the decrease in the mid-single digit percent range that we now assume. The incremental savings from our prior guidance is substantially due to lower incentive compensation and reduced expending in marketing, and travel and entertainment costs, along with reprioritization of investment and project spends.

I think you gave a lot of guidance on the updated forecast already, but just maybe a little bit more color on the MIS side. It seems like high yield and levered loans are the biggest culprits here, so maybe you can just flush this out a little bit more.

MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,40,Question,2020-04-30,1,2020,Alex Cram,,"Alex, thanks very much for your question. I think what we'll do here is similar to what we've done in the past where I'll talk a little bit about the issuance drivers that we're hearing from some of the banks, and then I'm going to turn it over to Rob to follow up with our internal viewpoint. Before I begin, it's probably worth noting that, in general, many of the banks we spoke with haven't yet updated their official issuance forecasts, especially for high yield, considering ongoing market volatility. Starting with U.S. investment grade, the banks are seeing a strong liquidity to start the year, with record March issuance volumes. Many of the initial issuance were towards the higher end of the investment grade spectrum. But access to the market was brought more recently as a result of the Fed's actions to improve liquidity, which has also led to narrower spreads. The issue with on balance showed a clear preference for longer-dated bonds, partially due to the temporary disruption at the front end of the curve in mid-March. And the majority of issuance was motivated by issuers looking to create additional liquidity and fortify their balance sheet, considering the uncertain environment. But with spread tightening and still low benchmark rates, there are favorable conditions for more opportunistic issuance later in the year.",,0.875
MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,41,Question,2020-04-30,1,2020,Alex Cram,,"M&A driven issuance is expected to be considerably lower than 2019, with some estimating more than 50% decline in M&A driven refinancings. The upcoming U.S. election cycle could also create volatility. So in terms of outlook, what we heard from the banks is that they are calling for U.S. investment grade issuance to be down 5% to up 5%. One note that's important to keep in mind for comparative purposes is the banks' use of investment grade issuance are inclusive of financials. After getting off to a solid start to the year, the banks also noted that U.S. speculative grade issuance came to a halt for most of March, as spreads widened above 1,000 basis points. The strength of the first two months of the year is obviously demonstrated by the year-to-date issuance still being ahead where it was this time last year, both the fixed and floating rate notes. And then more recently, there have been some positive signs with strong fixed rate issuance month-to-date in April. So with the preference for the higher end of the speculative grade market, the leverage loan market is seeing some indications of opening as well, but with a handful of transactions in April.",,0.791
MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,42,Question,2020-04-30,1,2020,Alex Cram,,"Turning to Europe, dynamics similar to the U.S. investment grade, though less pronounced with the ECB's corporate sector purchase program, and certainly their announcement this morning. Overall, the banks themselves estimate that year-to-date European denominated investment grade issuance volume is up about 30%, with the last week of March especially busy. Then finally, after getting off to a strong start to the year in January and February, the European high-yield market has seen significant dislocation as a result of the COVID-19, having been effectively shut for the last seven weeks to eight weeks. So, that's it. The banks are optimistic that conditions could improve in the near future, and that the recent ECB measures to improve liquidity in the European investment grade market would then have a correspondingly beneficial impact to the high-yield market, with a solid pipeline waiting for conditions to stabilize. And I suppose I could say more encouragingly, high-yield bond issuance has recently resumed, marking the first issuance since the market was shut down due to the impact of the virus.",,0.976

MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,45,Question,2020-04-30,1,2020,Alex Cram,,"Great. Thanks, Mark. Alex. Thanks for the question. I know there's a good bit of interest around our overall issuance outlook so I want to give a fulsome answer and continue to build on what Mark talked about. As we said, overall we're looking at a low double-digit decline and global rate issuance. For investment grade, you heard Mark talk about we're looking for something in the range of up to 10% for the reasons that Mark cited, which is really issuers have been really hitting the market bolstering liquidity and balance sheets. We think we're going to see a continuation of that activity and good market access for investment-grade issuers. We should also see some improvement in some of the non-U.S. regions and we've certainly seen that so far in April. Although not completely to the same degree that we've seen in the U.S. Your question specifically Alex, was around leverage finance. I think that you honed in on an area there. The key headwind for corporate issuance really isn't in our mind in the leverage finance sector. Certainly, we're starting to see some signs of improvement after the market was effectively shot for much of March but that said, I think we're going to see a challenging environment for leveraged finance throughout much of the year. There are a few reasons for that. One, some industries like oil and gas, transportation, retail, leisure we were expecting to see an uptick in defaults through the balance of the year, particularly at the lower end of the rating scale. That means we're going to see some attrition in terms of the number of issuers and our forecast have considered the default outlooks for those highest risk factors. Economic uncertainty and rising defaults are going to keep spreads elevated for those sectors, and that's going to weigh on issuance as well as M&A activity, which we think is going to be slow given the economic concerns that Mark talked about. Really leverage loan issuance as you heard Mark talked about being down. We think something in the range of twice what we're going to see high yield. There is a couple of reasons for why we think that leverage loan issuance is going to contract more than high yield. First, the rating distribution of leverage loan issuers is skewed more heavily to the low end of spec grade so that means we should see more defaults, higher spreads and reduced market access for leverage loan issuance. Second, the current stress that we're seeing in the CLO market is going to dampen the investor bid for leveraged loans. Third, the fact that we've got benchmark rates that are expected to remain very, very low, for considerably longer, it is going to again, skew the investor preference towards high-yield bonds rather than floating rate leverage loans. I think we'll continue to see issuance in the high yield bond space certainly from the BA area and really the fallen angels and the more resilient sectors. We're happy to go into some of the other sectors but let me pause there.",,0.884
MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,46,Question,2020-04-30,1,2020,Alex Cram,,"This is great. I'll have a quick follow-up and a little bit more I guess medium term. I think initially the view heading into this crisis was okay, there's going to be a recession and you will see massive deleveraging coming out of this, as we've probably seen in other recessions for short periods of time. But I think there is also a narrative here whereof the people say like, well, wait a minute. There is all stimulus. There's a lot of debt from governments but eventually, some of that debt is already today finding itself on corporate balance sheets or corporate debt. At the same time municipals are going to be struggling and will have to raise more and more debt. Is there actually a narrative here that when all said is done, there is going to be more debt in the world and more business for you to do and rates and more refinancing happening down the line versus maybe the easy to jump conclusion that the world is going to be leveraging and there's going to be less to do in the next few years?

There are obviously many narratives given the uncertainty that we have but I think there is a higher probability to the narrative that you just explained and is generally being assigned to that storyline in the market today. I think coming out of this with the banks going into the situation in much better shape than they were in during the financial crisis. The ability to supply liquidity, to allow M&A activity to move forward there will probably be distressed M&A coming out of this. The demands on the municipal sector to raise capital and a range of reasons for having debt in the market both opportunistically and out of need, I think is closer to a central case scenario as I said than I think people are generally giving credit for today.",1.4010321,0.55

Hi, this is Rob and I'm going to ask Steve to give a little bit of color on the renewals in a second. As you see now we expect growth for the full year to be in that mid-single-digit range and that implies a bit of a reduction which includes about 1% from unfavorable FX movements. There is a little bit greater impact to the ERS business due to some of the one-time nature of sales than we expect to see in the research data and analytics segment. But we do think that revenue growth is going to be impacted by our ability to close on sales from our existing pipeline as well as the ability just to generate new sales opportunities in the upcoming quarters. Mark touched on that. I'd say we're also actively mitigating those factors in a couple of ways. First, the impact of social distancing, we're really ramping up these virtual sales meetings so we're keeping our sales teams very engaged with our customers. Second, the issue around customer purchasing behaviors, we're adapting our sales campaigns to launch new product features and address very immediate customer needs. Within call it six weeks of experience that we've had under these conditions, we've updated our sales outlook to incorporate the impact of all of this on our sales generation for the remainder of 2020. Like I said, we think we have a little bit lower growth in RD&A and ERS in general. Steve, do you want to add to that just in terms of the renewals?",0.3170837,0.965
MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,52,Answer,2020-04-30,1,2020,Steve Tulenko,,"Yes, thanks very much. I would say that at least in my experience in renewing our accounts over the years, maybe the leading indicator, the most powerful indicator of a renewal problem is a lack of usage. I would say we have exactly the opposite going on here. Our usage levels are as high as they've ever been. In fact, we're showing 20% and 30% more usage this year than we saw at the same time last year. So quarter-on-quarter Q1 usage of our products and I mean across the board credit view The BvD products, the ERS products usage is up 20% and 30% across the board. Demand for what we do is very strong and I would say we're confident we'll renew most everybody according to schedule. There are some big macroeconomic factors that could affect the renewal yield and that's what we've tried to acknowledge in some of the slides that we presented earlier. A few of our accounts may face troubles and we wanted to acknowledge that. We see a little bit of an impact on renewal yield but that's probably measured in a point or two but not much more than that and the macroeconomy would be the biggest driver, not a lack of usage.",,0.328

Is there a bucket costs or efficiencies that we can think about as more permanent in nature given the actions that you're taking with the economic environment? I saw you made a call-out around projects and investments. Can you give a little bit more color on what type of projects and investments are getting reprioritized or pushed out? Thanks.",,0.909

Maybe I'll talk a little bit more broadly and then I will narrow in on your questions. I think there are two pieces here. The first is as a result of obviously COVID-19. We've taken a number of actions to put in place additional cost savings asides from those that arose from our 2018-2019 restructuring program or the previously stated $30 million in the 2020 cost efficiencies. We mentioned a couple of those in this part of the prepared remarks, either due to reducing certain expenses from the implementation of social distancing. For example, moving meeting formats to be more virtual rather than in person. That obviously saves travel costs. Secondly, we have evaluated a number of our spending plans and really gone through a reprioritization process with some of the initiatives that are more infrastructural back end being delayed slightly but really making sure that we focus on the business and our customers as a priority during this time. We've also revised down with some of the operating metrics in the environment. For example, our incentive comp has come down but equally importantly, the $30 million inefficiencies that we started the year with, we continue to invest in KYC, in RDC and ESG and in China. That's really important because we want to make sure during this period we take advantage of the opportunity to continue that investment cycle. There may be one of the last quick comment I'd add. During the March 11 Investor Day we did give a margin waterfall and we spoke about a number of the attributes there. It's important just to point out that we will continue that organic investment, which does contribute to a 50 basis point reduction in our margin guidance this year so we are continuing to invest.",3.0136157,0.983

Orders of magnitude have been similar in terms of the percent change and percent change for I think what we might consider the consensus outlook. So in that respect, we might see that the expectations for recovery we would follow fairly closely behind China having gone into this later. But again, I think at a macro level, there are expectations for a decent rebound in GDP in 2021, possibly in late 2020. I think that would impact both economies. That being said, there are elements of how the Chinese have handled the pandemic and how they are thinking about returning to a normal economy from a working standpoint than in the U.S. We're just going to have to see how some of the different approaches end up impacting the two economies because we have not taken identical approaches either to the shutdowns, handling the shutdowns or the reopening at this point.

The BvD growth this year has been good, very much in line with expectations that we set forth at the beginning of the year. Usage is very strong and I would say our lead flagship product ORBIS and many of the know-your-customer activities have grown in accordance with what we had expected and so going very well despite that simple problem that it's hard to go see customers right now. I'd add one more comment there, which is internally, we've found a lot of the projects we're doing with customers, the availability of the BvD Orbis product and availability of data has been very helpful because a lot of the questions people are asking right now in terms of size and scale of opportunity, size and scale of risk the BvD database has been very useful.",,0.964

There is a big proportion or a larger proportion of renewals due. They come due in December and January. Those are our two biggest months.

Yes, we think securitization broadly is going to be negatively impacted. It's probably in the range of 20% to 25% across most asset classes. I imagine their CLOs, we think is going to be more impacted-- more in line with what we're going to see for leveraged loans. That's really due to both the leveraged loan decline and leveraged loan supply as well as the spreads, the much wider spreads in the CLO space. The commercial real estate space is another area that we think is going to be adversely impacted so we can see CMBS will be down in the neighborhood of something like 25%. And then, the other consumer sectors I think, in general, we just anticipate a relatively slow recovery and that's going to curtail the creation of new mortgages and auto loans and in turn going to dampen the outlook for RMBS and ABS. But let me ask if Mike West wants to add to that answer.",2.3559103,0.836
MCO-2020-Q1-2020-04-30,68,Answer,2020-04-30,1,2020,Mike West,,"Yes. Thanks, Rob. I think there's two key variables here. First is the asset creation side and that's particular to corporate-backed securitization and that has to materialize and obviously we're seeing some stress in the system there. And then the second one is that the overall spreads on the instruments have to narrow to make those economics work.

Just a quick summary of those, we drew down approximately $500 million in incremental one- to three-month CP in March, and we did cancel [indiscernible] first quarter 10b5, share repurchase program.

The first question is just on the ESG side, that you had this slide with all the initiatives, and I get, what you're doing for your own, I guess, corporate angle.

So, just to give you a sense of kind of where we are from a revenue perspective with ESG, we're generating somewhere between $15 million to $20 million in revenues there.

Maybe, just to talk about the issuer stock for a second. So, we're seeing some real ongoing growth in what we call the labeled bond market, this has started as the green bond market and has evolved to kind of a broader sustainability bond market.

And we did something like 120 of those last year. So, that makes us one of the world leaders in that space and we're further making some refinements to that offering.

We've got ESG ratings on something like 4700 publicly listed companies, climate risk scores and over a million facilities. We're selling that to people for portfolio construction monitoring. And we're also now as I said, integrating that content into our MA offerings and we're seeing demand from data feeds, green stress testing, fiscal risk scores on our REIS platform that we just mentioned, even ESG training.

I'll start maybe with 2019 and then I'll move forward towards 2020. So, for 2019, certainly in the fourth quarter, we did report a decrease in margin of 160 basis points during the quarter.

And for 2019, we did see an increase of 140 basis points from 26.4% to 27.8%. It's worth noting that that 140 basis points increase included a headwind of approximately 40 basis points from the inorganic acquisitions we did in 2019.

U.S. leverage finance, we think we're actually going to see some growth, modest growth in U.S. high yield after what was a really strong year, obviously, in 2019, that's supported by those tight spreads and what we think is going to be, healthy refi activity.",0.1108714,0.96

Maybe a big place for me to start is really just to put things in context, certainly, over the last five years, free cash flows exceeded more than 100% of our net income number. If I look at 2019 and 2020, and I thought it was a 2019 number of approximately $1.6 billion for free cash flow, that looks like a 9% growth rate to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, which is $1.75 billion.",1.2227685,0.949

Because, if you think about MA, we've got a huge customer base of banks and insurance companies, as well as fixed income investors and commercial and non-commercial property players, who are coming to us and asking us for ESG and climate contents. And as I said, we're able to sell data feeds, we're able to bundle that into stress tests and scenario analysis. We're able to do training around that. We're bundling it into the REIS platform.

We have a huge installed customer base there. On the issuer side, as the ESG and climate solutions and these ratings and assessments become more and more important to companies, I think the companies are going to want to engage with companies like us, like we do in the credit rating process where you engage with us and the methodologies are transparent.

So let me just touch on CLOs for a second and then a few of the other lines in structured finance. Around CLOs, this was primarily from lower MIS rated CLO volumes. And, we had market deal volumes that were down slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, that continues to trend in the CLO market for the full year of 2019, where we saw total deal volumes by our countdown something like 10%.",3.2532355,0.459

We saw some growth in U.S. RMBS, that growth in activity was spurred by pretty attractive spreads and the ABS volumes and revenues were essentially flat. U.S. CMBS which is another important line for us in structured, that revenue grew modestly. The deal activity was pretty robust in the quarter, weighted towards those single assets, single borrower deals. And in general, 2019 was a pretty strong year for CMBS activity.

Incentive compensation for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $73 million and that was the full year total for 2019 to $237 million. Just the relative comparable to 2018 fourth quarter was $29 million and full year he was roughly $169 million.",0.6630106,0.586
MCO-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,147,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"So, if I take those incentive compensation numbers and you look at total operating expenses, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, they were up roughly 7%, vis-à-vis revenue for the quarter, which was up 16%, vis-à-vis adjusted EPS which was up 23%. And so incentive compensation was the primary driver of higher than expected expenses in the fourth quarter. A secondary driver was additional severance cost that we took in the fourth quarter. And if we exclude really those two drivers, we're very much in line with the guidance that we had given in the third quarter.",1.3596823,0.477

And then on the cost, as you think about the cost Mark, for this new year, can you just talk a little bit about the cadence over the course of the year how you think it may ramp up? I know you guys talked about costs for the whole year of low single digits, I believe, as soon as can be obviously down versus this big number you had in the fourth quarter. But, how should this sort of play out over the course of the year, including the acquisition of course? Thank you.",0.7857143,0.763
MCO-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,151,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"Maybe, best place to start here is with expense rent for the year. So we're expecting expense ramp guidance of somewhere between $20 million to $30 million on the first to the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, we are giving guidance for 2020 operating expenses in the low single digit range and this is primarily because merit increases in hiring are benefiting by the actions we took in 2019, through the restructuring program.",0.2651286,0.807
MCO-2019-Q4-2020-02-12,152,Answer,2020-02-12,4,2019,Mark Kaye,Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President,"And the second thing, I'll note is we do expect incentive compensation to return to more of a normalized level in 2020. So, back to that approximately $50 million per quarter. And the last reason I give is that we are incorporating inorganic acquisitions into our cost guidance as part of that expense ramp. I think for example, RDC, that's really what is part of the reason driving that low single digit for year.",0.4773071,0.103

Your ratings transaction related revenues were up 32%, your main competitor was up 55%. It was interesting to me that your ratings transaction revenues for the fourth quarter were the third highest of the year, lagging the second and third quarter was, your main competitor, he was the largest of the year in the fourth quarter.

It looks like the first month of the year was probably the best high yield issuance, at least for the last 20 years. And then on the flip side, the loans is probably the worst that we've seen in the last 20 years. When we see things like that, I know that loans are often a just kind of a substitute. I mean, they are substitutes for each other. But, how does that play out according to your expectation over as you go through the course of the year? Are you expecting them to kind of converge at some point in time when the refi activity places course with the lower interest rates, if you can just kind of comment on that?",,0.92

And maybe if we also look at fund flows that gives you a sense of investor sentiment. We had a solid year of fund outflows and leverage loans last year. We have seen a few weeks of inflows in January, the high yield side we've seen funding flows for several weeks to start the year again, I think more investor sentiment, kind of shifting as Ray said towards the fixed rate instruments.",0.8291631,0.153

As I said, we don't have an index business but what we do have is a very large customer base that I talked about in banks, financial institutions and insurance companies.

First, we had a very favorable mix of issuance. And by this, I mean that we saw very strong issuance from issuers who are typically infrequent issuers rather than issuers on relationship based arrangements with us. As Ray mentioned, U.S. bank loans, we saw a very healthy activity there. And we benefitted from issuance that was a bit more broad-based than last year where we had several kind of super-jumbo transactions included in the volume. So, this broader issuance generally leads to better revenue yield. We had very strong growth in first time mandates also contributing to that favorable mix. And as Ray mentioned, some pockets of very strong issuance growth, particularly outside the United States, EMEA bank loans, Asian corporate finance, Canada, to spotlight three.",1.7286454,0.989

We're getting some benefit from the stronger pound and euro, but on a constant dollar basis, growth is pushing up from high single-digits to double-digits and we're seeing good underlying performance in the business with better-than-expected yield from price, new sales production and net upgrades, somewhat offset by higher attrition.

If I look at typical seasonality, I think the guidance suggests a slowdown that's usually a little bit bigger than what we would expect typically.

And then maybe just shifting gears away from earnings for a second here, I wanted to ask you about BVD. When you had the call and you were pointing out the strong growth that these guys had, I think like 9% CAGR or so plus, I think there was a sense that a lot of that was true growth and very little pricing, and I think there's an expectation that you can do more there down the line. When we do our own channel checks, it actually sounds like pricing has been a fairly healthy component. In some cases, maybe there was even a goal to like, you renew or do you want to have now maybe close to like 10% increases from time to time again. These might be one-off conversations, but the point is, can you just compare and contrast what we may have heard and kind of like the sense that you'll have post the call now that you maybe have spent a little bit more time?",,0.931

We are going to be very focused on what kind of additional value can be provided, the synergies that we talked about, and that any pricing that we would seek to increase would be associated with the growth in value of the product and data that we're making available.",0.1736086,0.923

In answering the ramp question, looking at the first quarter expense run rate to the fourth quarter, now we're looking at a ramp of $40 million to $50 million, and previously we had said $30 million to $40 million. Some of that is because our projects are stretching out a little bit further into the year and we do expect some hiring in some of the businesses. However, we're keeping very close, very tight handle on hiring around here and we do continue very much to focus on expense controls, focus on T&E, but particularly using caution in hiring particularly in the higher cost areas and looking to substitute where possible in other locations. So, we continue that focus throughout the year.",,0.166

We have said that given that we are committed to delevering given the acquisition expense of Bureau Van Dijk, we are reducing the guidance on our share repurchases to approximately $200 million for both 2017 and 2018, and job one for Moody's right now is to delever from the financing cost for Bureau Van Dijk.

So in thinking about interest expense, we have been running at a rate that we had viewed as pretty normal of sort of $35 million a year rate in 2016. Now this year that rate has kicked up because we did do some issuance of $800 million in the first quarter of the year.

We replaced that bridge loan on June 12 and we returned that bridge loan with public bonds, a long five-year bond and a long 10-year bond. The blended interest rate on those financings is 2.94%.

So, we were light on the top line, the expenses were what the expenses were, and we did have some additional expense coming through related to the Bureau Van Dijk transaction.

MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,121,Question,2017-07-21,2,2017,Anjaneya Singh,,"I think you guys have touched on this stuff in other answers, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on margins. Clearly a strong quarter in the first half and there's many things contributing to that, but what are your thoughts on the sustainability of these high 40s margins in your guidance as we look ahead, how much of this is just the MIS mix and revenue flow-through that you've talked about versus the discipline and efficiency measures that you're also focused on, just any thoughts there?",,0.94
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,122,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Linda S. Huber,,"Sure. I'll take a start on this and then perhaps Ray might want to add some additional color. Margin is always a happier story for us when we have a strong revenue quarter, because we are pretty thoughtful about our expenses. So if we have a good top line, a lot of that comes down to operating income and helps us on the margin front.",,0.966
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,123,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Linda S. Huber,,"For the year, we've guided to approximately 43%. And of course if the revenue line turns out to move more strongly than we think for the back half of the year, there is the potential that we could do better. But given everything that we've set out for the back half of the year, we like this 43% guidance for the rest of the year and we've thought about that pretty considerably. Ray, I don't know if you have anything else you'd like to add.",,0.91
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,124,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, just I mean I think everyone is aware of this, but obviously if the second half of the year slows in a way that is not expected, our incentive comp accruals would flex in response to that. And so, we do have some ability to course-correct depending on what's happening with the top line.",0.6498341,0.223
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,125,Question,2017-07-21,2,2017,Anjaneya Singh,,"Understood, that's helpful. For second question on Analytics, could you just touch on ERS? The product sales growth continues to be super strong. Any updated views on what's sustainable or what the outlook there could be, how long do you think these double-digit rates can continue? And if you could just remind us what's driving the disparity between the U.S. and non-U.S. growth rates in that segment?",,0.941
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,126,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Mark E. Almeida,,"To take the second question first, the distinction between the U.S. and non-U.S. is really a timing phenomenon. The business is - from a sales perspective the business is doing well globally. So it's just what we're seeing on the revenue line, what projects are getting completed and what revenue is getting recognized, is variable by geography, it's not really indicative of anything fundamental about the business itself. So that really - again, I'd just emphasize that the business is performing well inside and outside the U.S.",,0.494
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,127,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Mark E. Almeida,,"With respect to the strong growth in product sales, that is a function of a couple of things. One, just generally the business is doing well, but also included in that very strong product sales growth on a trailing 12-months basis is the acquired sales from GGY. So you see them coming in and they are additive. So that's having a positive impact on sales growth.",,0.972
MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,128,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Mark E. Almeida,,"But going forward, we would expect product sales to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. I mean that's how we've built the business, that's how we've constructed our product strategy. We see demand to support that and that's how we expect to continue to drive growth in ERS, is through strong sales of product, again as we deemphasize the low margin implementation services business. This has been a big growth driver on the top line in years past but hasn't done much for us on the margin.",,0.637

MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,132,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Rob probably will want to add to my comments, but we did complete the realignment of our CCXI business in domestic China. So that business is now eligible to rate both parts of the Chinese bond market. So we are looking at opportunities with CCXI and we're also looking at how we may be able to provide research and ratings either from onshore or from offshore from Moody's Investors Service really aimed at the foreign investment community as opposed to the domestic Chinese community, which I think really will continue to be served by CCXI.",0.2583856,0.44

MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,134,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we will get the deal closed. We don't know when that will happen yet. We expect it to be in the third quarter, but we don't know specifically when that will happen. And then we're going to have to get organized around what our outlook is once we're able to really get in and work with the Bureau Van Dijk team.

MCO-2017-Q2-2017-07-21,138,Answer,2017-07-21,2,2017,Raymond W. McDaniel,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Europe has a higher percentage of issuers on frequent issuer programs and that's really I would say less a matter of preference in Europe versus the U.S. and more a matter of the relatively larger size of the U.S. speculative grade market which is characterized by infrequent issuers who don't find frequent issuer arrangements as attractive. So, I think that's really the story there.",0.373756,0.443
