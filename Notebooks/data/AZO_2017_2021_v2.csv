The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so.

And I guess the follow-up is in the same -- I guess, the same vein. So it seems like you're having success with this strategy, which on the one hand, is showing that there is some elasticity of demand. And now we're going to be going through a bit -- some inflation, and you're already starting to see it. And I would think in theory, the industry would try to pass that along. Is there any sort of disconnect? Or how should we think about inability to pass along pricing if the customer is showing elasticity, if that makes any sense?

It certainly gets a lot of a lot of attention. But we would not be in a position to even be talking about making pricing investments if we weren't executing so well, on all of the other elements of the strategy.

Number one, we've had outstanding leverage on the SG&A line, which quite frankly served as a little bit of a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making in gross margin. And we do have the ability as we move forward to continue to price in a very disciplined way, when we're in an environment where there's inflation.

So now you're having to invest almost half that amount to drive these share gains. How do you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors?

But if you look at the business now, do you think stimulus is still driving it now? Or was that largely been burned through?",0.4652813,-0.44
AZO-2021-Q3-2021-05-25,191,Answer,2021-05-25,3,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We exited -- I don't have the numbers right in front of me, because I went through -- I quoted some of them in the script. And we were very intentional about that, that talk about those four weak differences. So that you can see, as we were -- before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%, I think it was 49.9.",1.0775469,0.296
AZO-2021-Q3-2021-05-25,192,Answer,2021-05-25,3,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And when we came out the other side, and on a two-year basis, we were still up 26.7 in those last four weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last four weeks this year, were 14% with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single digit range. So what we have seen is that stimulus -- those stimulus dollars that came in March. They stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected.",0.4156107,0.508
AZO-2021-Q3-2021-05-25,193,Answer,2021-05-25,3,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Similar to what happened last summer, if you remember our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year. So clearly, that will be a headwind as we look in Q4, but not completely. Does that help?",0.0684237,0.864

Then my second -- I guess my follow up question would be something maybe bigger picture. But you look at the commercial business. And obviously a lot of cross currents at this point. But your commercials been a bright spot for AutoZone for a while. It's straight been here lately. As you look out there, what do you view? Is this still the slack within your model? And you're talking about opening the new -- the mega hubs and launching new programs? How should we think about the real drivers going forward as particularly as we pull out of this COVID crisis?",0.5448555,0.44

We're on a path ever 100 to 110. So we will more than double the amount of mega hubs that we have today. And I will tell you, Jamere, who's in charge of store development, has a big bogey out there to make that happen very fast.

As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago, it's still that way today. If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers.",0.418145,0.0

Onto our sales results, our domestic same store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level, congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment.",0.6355803,0.967

We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reach $12,600 for the year up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success. I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter, while our DIY two year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our two year stack, same store sales. In commercial on a two year basis our sales were very consistent with last year's performance.

This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first eight weeks of the quarter, our comp was 3.1%. In the last eight weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we like others who've benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales believe it is more insightful to look at a two year stack comp. For Q4 our two year comp was 26.0%. On a two year basis, our cadence for each four week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%.",0.6538267,0.863

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Regarding the quarters traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4% while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay at home orders and closures of big box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year 2022.",0.8813989,0.943

Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety, and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2's call we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with a hundred dollar incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID 19, that's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our on-going PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first, while caring deeply for our AutoZoners.

This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories work their way through the system. We can see low single digit inflation in retails as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers.

And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way.

AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,41,Remarks,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleverage 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses in the previous year. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.",0.7315761,0.951

This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year it benefited 35 basis points.

We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the share gain, could you give us a little bit more color I guess, as far as you know, where the share is coming from, is it warehouse distributors or from other two step distributors? And then, I guess are there particular categories that you're seeing relative outperformance and then I guess the cadence. You talked about maintaining the 10 points of share you'd picked up last year, is that slowed post COVID disruption. Are you still seeing the share gains continuing?",1.5179929,0.906
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,65,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Terrific. So I'm going to bifurcate it and talk about retail and then come back and talk about commercial and then Jamere if you'll jump in and clarify anything if I miss it. Sorry. I had a mask on. First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark and plus batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close in competitors. So we have facts there. We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share.",0.3137354,0.787

It's slightly positive, slightly negative month to month. But we basically grew our share in that dataset by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that. And I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time.",0.2944754,0.948

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data, but we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look what's going on with our close in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing in these kinds of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples two or three times the market growth.

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You probably has as good insights into that as we do, we look at the, the publicly available data. We see that we're, we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think that the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic, it's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last three years, as we implemented this latest round of strategy work, where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage, we're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our mega hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts. Jamere, do you have anything to add?",1.0709579,0.987
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,69,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes, I think a couple things stand out to me. One is that, as you mentioned, our business has been remarkably resilient and you combine that with a great execution that we have, and it's, it's striving exceptionally strong results. As we get further away from the lumpiness of the stimulus payments, I mean, it's clear that our share gains have been maintained. Bill talked about what we're seeing on the, on the sales floor market share. We've got great results and readouts from our loyalty programs that give us a lot of confidence.

And a couple of things really stand out to me, it's broad base. So it's national accounts and it's local accounts that are growing over 20%. We've seen the national snap back over the last year as car counts are up and staffing is improved and miles driven is improving. And our team is doing a fantastic job of executing with those customers.

We don't expect us to go much higher than, than where we currently are.

One you mentioned 200 stores in the Americas. Could you sort of walk us through the breakdown of what would be domestic and then those other markets and basically is that a, a run rate we should use going forward? If you look about, look at the opportunities and I have a follow-up.",1.4348708,0.963
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,77,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes. You can expect us to be in that zip code probably for the next couple of years or so. Roughly two thirds of that or more are going to be in and sort of the U.S. market if you will. We've, we've been looking at doing 150 to 170 stores, or so based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. You could see us do, 30 to 50 stores in Mexico, depending on the market conditions or so, and then, the remainder coming from Brazil. I think the good news for us is that we see tremendous market opportunities, both in the U.S. and in Mexico. And we talked about on our previous earnings call that we've been testing our market potential in Brazil for really the last decade or so and we think Brazil can be a very big market for us. So we've got great potential there. We've made some leadership team changes as well. So Tom Newbern is leading our international efforts going forward. Tom is a fantastic operator, has a ton of experience. And we look forward to that being a much bigger part of our story and our strategy as we go forward.",0.669177,0.802

And then the second question is linked to product availability and inflation. I think you mentioned that costs are going up, industries rationally passing it through. Was it fair to say the fourth quarter that inflation is maybe now running three to four in the top line, and how you think about that going forward?",2.6396351,0.214

I think we will see it at that level. As you know, it takes some time for those price increases to work themselves through the system.

AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,80,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so we're having to be thoughtful about how do we ultimately pass those price increases or cost increases on through retail prices in both the domestic, both the retail and the commercial businesses.

This we are running the lowest level of in stock that I can ever remember. It's, it's, 3% or 4% below where we normally run, it moves from one category to the other. This is the most difficult supply chain environment that I have ever seen, but I will tell you, our supply chain and merchants are working it so well. And so closely with our vendors and finding new suppliers along the way where we have to in the spot market or other areas that I think we are doing competitively.

I mean, we saw most of the moderation, obviously in our DIY business where our comps were significantly higher last year in the fourth quarter. But a couple things stand out to us.

As been our past practice, we typically don't you know, talk about what we see in the, in the early innings of, of the, the following quarter.

And, when we look at the moves that we made last year, we're going to start the anniversary, those going into this year. And as we said, the strategy is working. I mean, we, you see it in the numbers. We put on the board in terms of our DIY results and our commercial results and price has just been one element of the strategy. So all the other things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, and making sure that we have the right assortments, the investment that we've made in our products, the technology that we have on the commercial side, those things combined with competitive pricing have underpinned the growth story that you see here.",0.3082302,0.869

We're moving retails up on the commercial and in the DIY side, the industry has been very rational. But we're maintaining those competitive price differentials if you will, that have underpinned the share growth that we've seen over the last year or so. And that's what's really important. It's not an absolute price point of view is, if you will, but it's a relative price point. But as we have opportunities to take price up, we're certainly doing that.",1.1592254,0.902

Bill, the industry has seen tremendous DIY growth over the last several quarters as consumers have largely been staying at home, have had more time on their hands to do projects on their cars.

I'll let Jamere figure out the second part. On the sales side, your logic is very sound. If you look at the, our business overall is up roughly 25% versus pre pandemic levels. You've been watching this industry for a long time. I've been watching it longer and, it's generally a nice grower, but in the, the industry grows around 4% a year to grow 25% over 18 months is pretty phenomenal. I think, as we said, in our prepared comments, we expected our sales to step down some this summer that we saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really grow at an exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were.",0.4835276,0.989

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we spent a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we, we do think that that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. I would encourage, we've spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores. And I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors.

I think there are some online retailers that deemphasized this category during the pandemic. And, fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year? We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to think about on a long-term historical basis.

And I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. It will step back a little bit, maybe, I don't know, cause this is unchartered waters, but I do think we have reintroduced ourselves to some customers.

AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,107,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes. From a P&L standpoint, here's the interesting thing for us. I mean, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in our business going forward. And if you recall, this is a business that has an algorithm that works at low to mid-single digit top line growth with high margins, that's fits off a lot of cash that we invest in our existing assets. We invest to grow our business and we return a lot of that to shareholders. Over the last couple of years or so we've had the opportunity to have outsize top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about, what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain. Bill talked about it in his, in his comments this morning. You've seen us invest in our, in our growth initiatives and we've had an outsize return to shareholders. So the algorithm works. It's worked for us in the past. It's worked for us through this environment where we've had accelerated sales, where we've done even more than we've done in the past. And we've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our growth prospects going forward. We're going to have tremendous financial firepower to grow this business and return cash to shareholders. And that quite frankly, is the AutoZone algorithm.",0.1371705,-0.813
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,108,Question,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Very helpful. And my follow-up question is you seem to suggest that your gross margin is starting to stabilize either because you have lacked some of the price investments that you've made, or there's other factors that, that will also contribute your gross margins on pace to be 52.7% this year which is down almost a hundred basis points from, from the peak. So are you suggesting that you can get back to the peak level or now that you you've we based it lower, this is the right way to think about the gross margin moving forward.",2.7273188,0.695

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I think we're not projecting that we're going to get back to any particular level, Michael. I think what we are saying is for the most part, the actions that we have taken in retail are done, many of those actions are behind us. We are very pleased with the competitive position that we have. We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that, to those competitors, that I'll call or a half a step away.",1.0070958,0.272

And they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial, but we finished those actions at the beginning of, of this past quarter call it in June.

And we will annualize that in in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy, but as you can see in our commercial performance, we were winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in nine months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial. This was, this is what we wanted to do. And I think we're very pleased with how both have played out.",1.778003,0.836
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,112,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes. The only thing that I'll add there is that our core capability inside the company, hasn't changed. The things that we've historically worked on in terms of assortment the awesome work that our, our merchants have done over the years, the things that we see in terms of the industries, pricing dynamics, those things haven't changed. So, the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time.",0.5519096,0.94
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,113,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined. As we've seen inflationary impacts hit the business, we've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've, I've often said that inflation is our friend in that, in that we're in that regard. So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. What we've done as Bill said is, we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business and nothing else about our businesses has changed. So all the great work that we've done in the past, we still have that capability going forward.",0.3195266,0.707

And then my follow-up, maybe it is it's for you Bill, because you're, you had the quote in the press release about aspiring or aiming for growth prospects in this current fiscal year. I assume you're mentioning, it's meant to be sales curious if it can be sales and EBIT or one could be without the other. And then, 2022 is a complex year because of what you're lapping. Is there any reason we shouldn't be back to algo by 2023? The only thing different I heard on the call was just additional capital investments, Bill that you mentioned in terms of investment, not sure if those hit the P&L any different, but if you can speak about, theoretically the, the out year progression.",0.3705018,0.842
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,120,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's a, it's an interesting way out. I would've told you FY 2022 would have been the normalized year this time last year Simeon, but I just can't tell you what's going to happen in the environment. I mean, we're sitting here take, we'll get people with mask on. Jamere and I are taking our mask on and off to answer questions. I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we're done with them. And here we are with Delta variants, so I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is, is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level as I keep calling it to three decimal points.",1.3958439,0.194
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,121,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly on our people. So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. So that that'll be, over, over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend.",1.8783578,0.96
AZO-2021-Q4-2021-09-21,122,Answer,2021-09-21,4,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But as we've said, all along our capital allocation strategy is one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have to have them perform at an optimal level. Two, invest in every growth aspect that we can, that will provide us a reasonable investor IRR, and then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders, that algorithm is going to stay the same. I hope in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as, as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY 2020 and 2021. I would have thought the same thing a year ago. I'm getting more and more confident that some of this is structural and some of this is permanent.

And as we think about just modeling the impact of cost increases, when did you really start to experience an acceleration of cost inflation? And as you set out that inventory, could there be a period where you're able to raise price on product sold that may have been acquired before costs really went up, which would enable some gross margin expansion, just as we think about modeling the cadence of the sell in versus sell out, how should we think about that?",0.6259503,0.958

We started to see the cost inflation really at the tail end of the third quarter and pretty much all of the fourth quarter. And, our merchants have done a fantastic job of negotiating timing and also done a fantastic job of making sure that we got retails raised in a way that kept us competitive in the, in the marketplace. And the way that, costs actually ended up flowing through the system. You typically will have a little bit of margin accretion at least in the early endings, as you raise retails before all of the costs increases, make their way through. And to the extent that, we see price increases come, there are times where we actually move a little bit early.",1.3522554,0.128

And that's no different than, what we've done in the past.",0.8859605,0.718

It has basically doubled the wage inflation during this period of time. It is very, very difficult to get new AutoZoners to join the company. I hear that from all of our retail peers. Fortunately in the last five weeks or so we, things have changed a little bit. I don't know if that's directly related to the change in enhanced unemployment or not. But we have seen a meaningful improvement in the ability to hire people in both the distribution centers and the stores over time.

And certainly we're not immune to the market dynamics there. What else is that, we've done a very good job of sort of managing it. Our operations teams, both on the stores and the supply chain side are working really hard to manage turnover in this environment. We've been competitive in the marketplace. And then, when it, when it's all said and done, we do have pricing power that underpins our capability to price, to deal with the influx of the impacts of inflation, whether it's product costs or transportation costs, or what we're seeing in terms of labor.

And then, I guess, I will throw the follow-up and then I don't know if you have a thought on the -- if CARES 2 will help commercial or DIY more, but the follow-up is also on gross margin. And in the past, I don't know if you have provided a rule of thumb or the market has that gross margin for AutoZone could be up on average from 10-ish basis points or so a year. Is that still a fair framework, the idea maybe or is there a lower threshold given your reserve the right to invest back in price and then, if it was down a little in 2020 does that mean it could be up a little bit more than sort of typical algorithm in 2021?",0.131858,-0.647

We continue to focus on growing business with existing customers.

In recent years, there have been macro headwinds, specifically two consecutive mild winters negatively impacting demand in the upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets, along with delayed tax refunds last year that did not translate to an increase in business during that time period in a manner that was similar to previous year's.

Weather effects will even out over time but remains a negative as the effect of the mild winters has reduced demand for failure and maintenance related parts. This past quarter, we continued to see the impact as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern stores underperformed the remaining country by over 200 basis point in comps. Although these markets have underperformed for the last couple of years, we have begun to see improving trends in the Northeastern market, which encourages us heading into the new calendar year.",0.1971617,-0.572

The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years.

For the quarter, our sales increased 4.9% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.3%. All three months of the quarter, September, October and November were positive with November being stronger on both a one and two year stacked basis. As I have previously said, our Northeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets representing roughly 25% of our state sales continue to underperform by approximately 200 basis points as a result of two consecutive mild winters. During the quarter we opened 15 net new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business expanded by 6.7% while opening 30 programs. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter's 5.9% increase as we continue to execute on our strategies to grow sales. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year. Currently 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program.

As a reminder, multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for SKUs that are stocked in those stores, wile the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before.

As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, both for retail and commercial. Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.",0.0091232,0.542

The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and it takes time.

I want to take a moment and remind listeners of our adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L. This past quarter it lowered our tax rate 52 basis points. This compares to the benefit we had of 74 basis points to the tax rate in last year's Q1. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. While the impact on this adoption was minimal to the tax rate at 52 basis points this quarter, it is worth highlighting that it had a 358 basis point impact on our rate in Q2 of last year.

Three, as the holidays shift, we will loose two selling days in our DIFM business, which will negatively impact our sales growth in DIFM.

As we continue to expand our mega hubs, which by the way we couldn't be more pleased with, as we continue to expand it will have more and more that will get same-day service versus overnight service and some of those will even get multiple times per day service from that mega hub.

So one of our mega hubs, for instance, is in Los Angeles. Today that store may be providing service to San Diego but it's doing it on an overnight basis. As we potentially build a mega hub in a San Diego type market, then all of a sudden those stores can move from overnight service to same-day service. It's simply the proximity of this location of the store to the mega hub. It's got to be, if they are within 100 miles, we might be able to service them three times a day. If they are 200 miles, we might be able to get there one time a day. If they are 400 miles, we got to get there overnight.",0.7648251,0.705

We said in our prepared remarks, we are going to 25 this year, hopefully if we can get them all open. That's our plan. But when we originally rolled it out, we said 25 to 40 and we have made a small tweak in what we were saying, we don't talk about 25 anymore because we are going to be there by the end of the year. We say up to 40 and the more we learn about it someday that number could go up as well. It's been on of those initiatives that continues to outperform our expectations. And as it outperforms our expectation, it allows us to expand it further. But I also think it's important to understand we are also not competing in a stagnant environment.

I think on last quarter's call, you as a company offered a somewhat subdued perspective on the sales potential for the business. I am understanding that you have got a bit of a bump from the hurricane, the sales accelerated nicely. They recently exceeded Wall Street expectations and you are talking about the potential for the business to pickup, I am not sure if it's off current levels or from prior assumptions, if the weather turns seasonable in the fourth quarter rather in the calendar fourth quarter and into winter. Anything change in the backdrop or anywhere else to alter your read on your prognosis of the forward here? Or is it just that the business did pickup and showed its potential?

If you will recall on the last quarter, I talked about the fact that the perception of our industry's performance over the last two or three quarters was that we had reached a new all-time low in performance. And I was very careful to talk about that. But that truly wasn't the case. So if you looked at our industry's performance or AutoZone's performance over a five or 10 year period of time, that our performance last year was operating within the normal bands of what we have experienced.

And those headwinds are, as Bill talked about before, you have got a little bit of wage rate pressure that continues to exist although the team has done a terrific job of managing our way through that and we have a little bit of occupancy pressure as you are seeing that coming from mega hubs and hubs as well as we are seeing rising real estate tax costs across the country as well. So those are some of the things that are little bit of headwinds. We think we can manage our way through those. But I think that that's a pretty good run rate to look at.",0.0647443,0.778

To answer the first part of the question, we haven't seen a significant amount of inflation and frankly we haven't for probably a couple of years now.

Commercial is a little bit more visible to you because we call it out specifically. But both of them improved in Q1. As we look at what's going on with the industry, part of what's happened is those mild winters have put less strain on the under car components. So think about chassis and brake components and shocks and struts. That didn't go away when the summer went. That lack of wear and tear has continued and those jobs are done, by both DIYers and DIFMers. So that's why it impacts both markets in a similar fashion.",0.4738976,-0.033

It's probably not as big as you would expect, because you have got to remember, these SKUs that we are talking about are really on the tails of the bell curve and so having them available even for next day, they will be there first thing in the morning and when you talk about some rural markets or those kind of things, that's pretty amazing that we can get them there.

So last year, we did get a cold snap and it was December 1 to Christmas. And so we had some real strong sales during that period of time and then it got warm.

One is, when it gets really cold really fast, we get an immediate bounce on our business like in batteries. But what happens over time in the longer tail on the winter is, when the road conditions get bad, we will get a longer tail on under car parts, chassis, breaks, ride control, those kind of things. Those are things that you wake up that day and your car can't get you to work, those are things that they put more stress on the components and so the maintenance cycles accelerate.

And then for the second four weeks the world changed radically, literally overnight. Our sales performance immediately declined materially dropping to a one week low of comps down more than 25%. We began asking ourselves questions we never fathomed before. Do we have the liquidity necessary to weather this storm? Will we have issues with our debt covenants? Will we need to furlough AutoZoners or reduce compensation? How quickly and significantly can we stop capital expenditures and expenses? We immediately acted to shore up any liquidity concerns. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. Then we issued $1.25 billion of bonds on Wednesday, March 30. We also closed on an additional 364-day $750 million line of credit.

We feel there may be a real opportunity for us to grow our business in the future.

So far what we're seeing is it looked a whole - looks a whole lot like it did before the pandemic, but I'm sure consumers are going to adjust parts of their behavior and we'll have to adapt accordingly to that.

And we've held to that and believed that however, and we learned during the Great Recession that during certain periods of time, it is not correlated very well at all with the industry same-store sales. We saw that in 2009, 2010 and 2011. That there are just other factors and our thought is when people have a high degree of unemployment, people aren't buying new cars and the like that miles driven aren't as important as they were.",1.0831221,0.667

Many of which we're thinking through and we certainly don't have definitive conclusions at this point in time. I think on the shift between DIY and DIFM, there's been a long pattern of both sectors of the industry growing pretty well. DIY has been - our DIFM has been growing slightly faster than DIY, but DIY has continued to grow almost every single year. A lot of people are starting to talk about work-from-home. I think that they're also not thinking about who our customer is, for the most in particular, on the DIY side of the business. Our customers' generally are financially fragile customer. They're not going to have the opportunity to work-from-home. They're working blue collar jobs in a lot of cases.",0.0126711,0.892
AZO-2020-Q3-2020-05-26,95,Answer,2020-05-26,3,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so their shift in work, even during the crisis wasn't to go work at home, they had to be out doing their jobs. As we've seen, we rolled out curbside pickup, which was really great. Our team did it in a remarkably short period of time. And we've seen all of our digital sales grow through Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, which includes curbside. We've seen our next day delivery grow and we've seen our ship to home grow. The biggest growth that we've seen is in our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store.",0.244298,0.439
AZO-2020-Q3-2020-05-26,96,Answer,2020-05-26,3,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And as I've been out in stores, I've yet to see a customer do a curbside order. And as I talked to AutoZoners, I ask them, are you getting a lot of curbside orders? And they say, no. Once the customers realize that we're open, in fact, they'll come to the door and say, can we come inside? Then they want to come in and interact with our most important asset, which is our AutoZoners. So as people start returning to this new normal, it seems like their behaviors are pretty consistent with the way they were in the past. Now our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store is basically double what it was pre crisis right now. But that's still a very, very small percentage of our business.",0.4145971,0.604
AZO-2020-Q3-2020-05-26,98,Answer,2020-05-26,3,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we absolutely saw commercial customers close on a temporary basis. Probably, as indicated by we had zero purchases from them for weeks, call it 5% to 10% of our commercial customers. It's very interesting as the stimulus money came in, as the commercial business began to pick up. One of the interesting things we've seen is, we were worried about our commercial receivables. Well, we're seeing that our commercial customers are in fact catching up on the receivables that they got behind on in the crisis. So I don't see any big wave of commercial customers that are closing. I'm sure that they are on the margin, certain commercial customers that were nearing retirement or we're teetering on the edge of not being solvent and they're going to go away. But I don't think that that business is going to go away. The customer might - that particular shop might go away, but then the work is just going to move to another shop. So I don't see any significant shifts yet at this point in time.",0.2042575,0.685

For a long time, we've been working on making sure that we have diversity in particular categories, vendor diversity. And as - it's actually again thinking about this long before the crisis hit, but the crisis made it even more acute at this point in time. But as you think about what's happened with China with the tariffs over the last year or so, it's significantly increased our cost structure at a moment's notice and what having all of certain categories, even if we had two or three or four vendors, all of those vendors would were in China take rotors and steel products, for example. All of those are coming out of China, when that happens and you get slapped with a 10% or 25% tariff, your costs went up 10% or 25% overnight. So we need to be thinking as we always have about vendor diversity, we also need to think about country diversity and this situation COVID-19 only made that, that much more important.",0.5266092,0.112

I think also we were in the heart of the tax season and so we were able to execute very well on that.

So those two categories probably were a little bit of a headwind, so that kind of mixed out. And we wound up having kind of a flattish gross margin, so frankly we feel really good about the health of our gross margin, right and would continue to expect it to be strong and slightly positive as we move forward.",0.2551687,0.872

There are certain players in the commercial side of the industry that don't have the financial strength that we have. We've been there throughout the entire crisis, taking care of our customers and getting better and better every day.

With this, what we've been doing with the China products anyway. Certainly Bret, it would take a considerable amount of time, but it's one of those things, if you don't ever start it, then you'll never get there. We've already begun some of that work. In fact, right before the crisis, I can remember having a conversation about some of our folks go into Turkey and we're like, are we comfortable with them going to Turkey? But those kinds of markets, Vietnam, South Korea, we've been working those markets for some time, India. And Mexico is bigger than anybody outside of China.

But I will tell you when we look back over this acceleration over the last five quarters, it has not been one thing. It has been due to several different initiatives that we've had in place and frankly, been in the works for several years, whether that's inventory assortment improvements, where that's getting our store managers and district managers involved, whether it's they building the reputation and the brand of the Duralast products that we sell, there has been a whole host of different things that we believe have contributed to this growth.",0.0917385,0.649

Certainly, in certain product categories, we've seen the tariffs come in and they've been meaningful. But we have not taken the full cost impact because of our weighted average cost accounting model. So those costs come in over time as the inventory turns. So we have moved our retails up, as I said, in tranches. And when we've seen them go up, we have seen some elasticity of demand in certain categories, not a ton.",0.5139382,0.813

I think the first one on the DIY business. Bill, I think you said, we expect the strength or strong results to continue specifically around DIY.

AZO-2020-Q1-2019-12-10,120,Question,2019-12-10,1,2020,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"In another way of asking it is why not maintain the current algorithm in which EBIT growth continues to grow steadily maybe at a lower rate and - but you continue to take market share, which seems like you're able to do and there's lots of it.

We've got a fair number of investments that were current that we've made and that we're currently working on, as Bill highlighted, many in technology.

That's 10% or 15%, I don't know, but I'm really excited about the initiatives that we have in front of us.

And I would say that gross margin, we feel good about. I mean this quarter, we had a relatively flat, I think, was up 8 basis points on gross margin.

I think it depends on what happens in that week in February, as I've talked about a couple of times already. That particular point in the calendar is very volatile. The last time we had this, it was very favorable to our second quarter results. We don't know what will happen this time.

I would say on the megahub markets, I mean, we continue to see good performance out of them and not to dissect it too much. But it depends on how broad the market is and how close then the market is.

AZO-2020-Q1-2019-12-10,151,Answer,2019-12-10,1,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think, we're still identifying what we believe to be the maturation curve from a sales perspective on megahubs.

AZO-2020-Q1-2019-12-10,152,Answer,2019-12-10,1,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So it becomes a little non-comparable when you look at some of the hubs today versus where they were like maybe five years ago in terms of what we've done inside the box to be able to drive sales. So the short answer is that, the maturation curve of both hubs and megahubs is still evolving.

I would say, I don't think that we're - I think the margin for commercial continues to remain healthy and there are obviously opportunities for us to improve margin on both sides of the business. But at the same time, keep in mind, that we're growing commercial at a rapid rate, but we're also making some investments and that's helping drive that. So over the long-term, I would expect margins to improve as some of those investments become more mature. But over the shorter-term, I would expect our margins to remain stable.",0.7090725,0.961

I just keep going back to - it trades in such a tight band that it's really hard to say. We certainly think lower gas mileage is beneficial. We think miles-driven increases are beneficial. But there's so minuscule that they're just not big drivers of the business overall. We think the most important driver of what happens with the DIY business is what our AutoZoner do to provide great service to our customers. And I think we're doing a really, really good job of that right now. The morale of this organization of our teams in our stores, in particular, they know they're winning.

And so there's a lot of things in the pipeline. So we might like to accelerate some of them, but there is a certain amount that we can digest as an organization.

You have some inflation baked in there as well on the inventory. And then again, I think a couple of points that I'm going to refer that Bill pointed out highest in-stock level ever with a corporation, continued investments in hub and megahubs, again, inventory closer into the customer wins and we're going to continue to go down that path.

AZO-2017-Q4-2017-09-19,124,Question,2017-09-19,4,2017,Matthew Fassler,Goldman Sachs,"Good. My first question relates SG&A. So, you did have a bigger - a higher year-on-year growth rate than you'd have over the first nine months of the year by about 250 basis points. At the same time, your growth rate, your SG&A growth rate in the fourth quarter was relatively subdued, so on a two-year basis there wasn't as much of a delta. As we think about the rate of SG&A growth and I guess, within the two year stacks and the SG&A growth is quite modest, was quite modest in the first nine months of this year, the first two quarters of this year, is the dollar growth rate that we saw in Q4 look like it's sufficient to do what you need to do for the business given that how low the SG&A growth was, particularly in the middle of the year when your shelves were quite soft?",0.5395001,0.961

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes, I would say that the Q4 is probably a reasonably good target number for us as you kind of think about it going forward. And so just to jump to chase, occupancy was a little bit higher this quarter, some rent pressure is there on some of the new markets that we've gotten into and some of the investments that we've made in technology which typically have a shorter depreciation life have driven depreciation cost, but I think that the Q4 is probably a good metric to look out.",0.0130577,0.735

So, it looks like definitely you disclosed on the buyback what we saw on the share count there are two kinds running on, one is that you must have bought back most of your stock quite early in the quarter to get that $622 mark? And secondly, even though the buyback was a bit smaller than we had modeled, the share count was lower presumably despite some of the stock price wasn't treasuring that, so can you just give us clarity on both of those items for the buyback?",0.8305085,0.916
AZO-2017-Q4-2017-09-19,127,Answer,2017-09-19,4,2017,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","And one of the thing to think about too, by the relative to buyback overall for the year is that, man, I think we came in around $1.070 billion or so for total share repurchases this year, but keep in mind also we're kind of measuring or we're kind of metric-ing back to that 2.5 times credit metrics for EBITDAR and we wind up at 2.57 or so, so we're a little bit ahead of what our typical target is, which is also to maintain investment grade rating which we believe is the right place for us to be, so there's no change in the capital allocation strategy. We may have bought back the stock a little bit earlier in the quarter overall, but more importantly from the capital allocation strategy, we're maintaining that 2.5 times EBITDAR credit metric, maintaining investment grade rating and we'll continue to deploy capital methods.",0.7551687,0.827

First of all, I think, there's two different elements of it that have happened. First of all, there were a series of retailers that moved wages up in 2015 and 2016, and the effects of those wage increases by large retailers have had a trickle down effect to the rest of the market. That you would think would presumably be getting over in the next year, 18 months, as the market adjust to those rates.",0.2600101,0.778

And this is the smaller piece today, but it's going to get bigger and bigger over the next three or four years. There are municipalities like Los Angeles County that went to $12 minimum wage on July 1. The State of California is going to go to $12 minimum wage on January 1, and all these are going to be marching towards $15 an hour average wage, that will cause pressure on wages for an extended period of time.",0.4343639,0.115
AZO-2017-Q4-2017-09-19,136,Answer,2017-09-19,4,2017,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Will that reflect an increased retail prices? Well, at the end of the day, inflation gets into businesses. And this industry has shown over time that as inflation comes in, we are able to pass along many of those costs, if not all of them to the consumer in increased prices. So that's the way we're thinking about it today. But it really is unprecedented in my career to see the wages go up to the extent that they have this year. So my sense is, they will continue to be up for a year or so and then it will be muted from where it is today, but still at elevated levels.",1.3796249,0.392

AZO-2017-Q4-2017-09-19,143,Question,2017-09-19,4,2017,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"Thanks. Good morning. My first question is clarification or a follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked. Maybe for Bill Giles, if for 2018 the comps return back to, let's say, 2.5% to 3%, just trying to ascertain the expense run rate and maybe margin for next year, will the EBIT growth look more normal on that basis, or there is still some elevated spending in the year? And as part of that question, if comps are 2.5% or so 3%, do - does that entice you to speed up some investments, such that you don't see the full flow through anyway?",0.0317351,0.83
AZO-2017-Q4-2017-09-19,144,Answer,2017-09-19,4,2017,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I don't know if it would speed up the investments. Obviously, we're going to make the investments on the places for which we believe that we're getting the adequate returns on. And as Bill articulated earlier on MFD as an example, we haven't seen the full results of that, so we pulled back on that a little bit and you saw that show up on some of the margin. So I think that, if same-store sales were to get to 2.5% or 3%, that obviously would improve our EBIT performance, there's no question about that and we'll manage expenses accordingly. And we'll make sure that we continue to provide great customer service along the way and we'll make the investments where we believe that we're getting good adequate returns on them and make adjustments along the way.",0.8645267,0.915

And then my follow-up for Bill Rhodes guarding the industry's top line, I don't know if what is sort of normal for this industry, whether it's two to three or three to four. So - but I'm curious if the way you look at the last year is, if we're sort of on a glide path down to some new normal that maybe less than that three to four, or if the slowdown is cyclical and we should get back to the old normal run rate?",0.0909021,0.636

We were growing during that period of time commercial in the low teens. We don't believe we're going to be running the low teens in the foreseeable future.

Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago.

Yes, as you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades.

In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where our customer's really picking a channel, they're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are two primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buttons.

And we've also made a lot of other back office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone.

We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs, and customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day.

But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omni-channel provider.

And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing.

Our sales results for the fiscal fourth quarter improved from last quarter with May and August outperforming June and July and all months experienced positive comp store sales in both retail and commercial. Sales results as many of you would expect were stronger in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets and our harsh winter created parts failures in these markets. Our sales results however were noticeably below our expectations in several Western markets. We attribute this sluggishness out west to comparatively mild and rainy weather for much of the summer versus last year.",0.2326406,0.844

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our sales performance improved, we have certainly felt we had opportunities to do even better. We executed a significant amount of changes in the second half of fiscal 2018 including product category changeovers, supply chain changes and we stopped our digital ship-to-home promotions. In hindsight, this was a tremendous amount of simultaneous change and our execution while terrific in many areas didn't meet our standard of flawless and negatively impacted our business. As we enter the new fiscal year most of these are behind us, we are improving quickly. While we continued to gain share, the more robust market share gains we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year subsided in the second half and we are committed to regaining that momentum very quickly. We remain encouraged by the health of the consumer and the health of our business. We are bullish on our business for the New Year.",0.0598074,0.987

To remind everyone those initiatives for the past year included improving local market inventory availability, growing our U.S. commercial business, leveraging the Internet and investing in IT at accelerated rates across the entire enterprise. Regarding enhancing parts coverage in the United States, we continued expanding our supply chain network in the quarter adding three new mega hub stores and 78 new stores. In addition to opening two new domestic distribution centers over the last five quarters and expanding another, we are extensively leveraging our hub network to provide expanded parts coverage at the local level where the customer demands are immediate.",0.2686265,0.957

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As you would expect we study our sales results in markets that receive additional parts coverage with hubs and we see noticeable increases in comp store sales when we open these locations. We rely on our mega hubs to act as distribution nodes for hard-to-find parts for their network stores. We ended the year with 24 mega hubs, have been very pleased with their performance and expect to open many more in fiscal 2019. In our commercial business, we saw our best quarterly sales performance since Q1 2016 improving nearly 9% while having opened fewer than 150 net commercial programs for the year. Our productivity for commercial program was very strong year-over-year. We were encouraged that this growth was from both winning more business with existing customers and gaining new customers. We are gaining momentum driving more sales through existing programs and customers, while still adding new customers all along the way.",0.4941713,0.98

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And our accelerated investments in technological enhancements to improve our service and grow all of our businesses continues at a strong clip. We are investing at the highest levels ever for our company to deliver on some pretty aggressive internally established goals. One of those goals that we have been focusing on is next-day delivery. At quarter end customers in 83 major metropolitan markets can place in order as late as 10 PM and have their orders delivered by early afternoon the next day. Our expectation is the majority of our shipped home orders will be fulfilled this way in the future. Although this is not a significant part of our sales mix today, it is growing rapidly and we believe it's another example of providing wow customer service and enhancing our value proposition to our customers. As we gain confidence in our ability to execute we will begin more aggressively advertising this unique and differentiated service offering.",0.1885454,0.973
AZO-2018-Q4-2018-09-18,12,Remarks,2018-09-18,4,2018,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Before getting into more detail about the quarter I want to share our perspective on some of the trends and tailwinds that our industry and specifically our business have seen. First, the customer appears to be getting healthier and the rebound in our industry sales this summer illustrated that improvement. Some of this stems from the cold winter in a large part of the country that in turn increased demand of failure and maintenance related parts. Our business in cold weather markets easily outperformed the remainder of the country with the spread in comp sales between 200 basis points and 300 basis points throughout the quarter. Surprisingly, we did not do as well out west, with comp sales noticeably weaker than other parts of the United States. We can attribute some of this weakness to a milder summer than last year, but we also believe we have some considerable opportunities for improvement. As I had said earlier, our quarter began very well in May. However, it softened in June and July only to reaccelerate again in August. While our overall sales improved for the quarter, we believe they should have been more robust. We had some significant vendor transitions in the second half of our fiscal year and several of those transitions did not go as planned, resulting in unacceptable in-stock positions and sales shortfalls in those particular categories. We have addressed those challenges and feel we are better positioned heading into the new fiscal year. We also believe once these transitions are successfully completed we will be in improved competitive positions.",0.7404967,0.979
AZO-2018-Q4-2018-09-18,13,Remarks,2018-09-18,4,2018,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And as we opened our Ocala distribution center, re-optimized our supply chain and implemented our final multiple frequency of delivery schedule changes that too was a significant amount of change for the organization to absorb and we decided back in February, at the end of our second fiscal quarter, to eliminate online promotions for ship-to-home sales. We were concerned about the potential channel conflict. After several months of being dark in promos, while competitors continued to promote, we became concerned that we potentially were or could negatively impact our customers' value proposition of us. As a result of eliminating promotions, those direct sales went from adding about 10 basis points to our comp to becoming a headwind in the quarter of roughly 30 basis points or approximately 40 basis points lower comp in the second half of the year. While we were intentional with our removal of the promotions and believe long-term it may create more channel conflict, we recently reinstituted promotions to better assess their overall impact on traffic both online and in-store and overall sales.",0.5783071,0.612
AZO-2018-Q4-2018-09-18,14,Remarks,2018-09-18,4,2018,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Combined, all these various issues negatively impacted our sales performance in the quarter. While we will never flawlessly execute in every aspect of our business, this quarter we believe we had a disproportionate amount of opportunities and believe we have resolved most of them as we begin the new year. Over the last year, we have been highlighting accelerated wage pressures and the impact those pressures have on our operating expenses in the upcoming year. We plan on investing in wages for targeted positions across our hourly store teams this fall with specific emphasis on the most critical positions and our most tenured AutoZoners. It is important to note, those wages changes will go into effect midway through this, our first quarter of fiscal 2019. It is also important to note that means the first full quarter with the incremental expense will be our second quarter, which is always our most challenging profitability quarter. In addition, we accelerated our investments in employee benefits and information technology. These investments will cause operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase. However, we do expect these investments over the long-term to improve our performance.",0.1601622,0.848

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In fiscal 2018, our results included many moving pieces, the sale of two businesses and related impairments, the new tax law and this quarter, the termination of our pension plan and related settlement charge. Our expectation for 2019 is it will include far fewer unusual items or moving pieces. However, it will include two significant items. In fiscal 2018, we enjoyed only a portion of the lower effective tax rates as our fiscal year straddled the tax reform changes. Next year, we will receive the full benefit and our blended tax rate will decline from roughly 30% to closer to 24.5%. Additionally, we will have a 53rd week and our fourth quarter will include 17 weeks instead of the typical 16 weeks. To model the extra week, I encourage you to review fiscal 2013 and specifically the fourth quarter.

Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1.3% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 78 net new stores in the United States. For the year, we opened 153 net new stores and expect to open approximately 150 domestic stores in 2019. Our commercial business expanded by 8.8%, while opening 149 net new programs this year. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter's 7.3%. We again expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs for this fiscal year. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand in Mexico, opening 28 new stores and we opened 4 new stores in Brazil. While we would hope to have up to 25 Brazil locations open by the end of the year, we expect these stores to open in fiscal 2019. We have been doing business in Brazil since 2013 and we expect to accelerate our location expansions in 2019.",0.131779,0.933

Our goal is to create a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers, meeting them where, when and how they want to interact with us. We remain focused on improving our closure rates meaning converting customer requests for pricing and availability into sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms both domestically and internationally. We understand we must be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences to meet all of our customers' needs.

This past quarter, we opened 3 additional mega hub locations and now have 24 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately 10 more in 2019. We now expect to ultimately operate a larger number of hubs and mega hubs than we previously planned. This number will evolve over time. However, we feel a hub network for us is the most efficient way to provide enhanced local market availability. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for investment and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.",0.3096807,0.972

In the local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter, while the exchange rate was a headwind to the reported U.S. dollar sales. The peso exchange rate was 7.3% higher than last year's Q4 ending rate. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 48% over last year's fourth quarter due to the divestiture of our AutoAnything business and lower e-commerce ship-to-home sales. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses make up this segment of sales. We recognized that most of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase. And our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us, the omni-channel experience is very important for our customer experience and we will continue to invest in this platform.",0.0131779,0.25

As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices while higher than last year remain range sound in the $2.80 a gallon area, miles driven continue to increase. We not surprisingly desire lower gas prices as the lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. There have also been many questions about the impact tariffs could have on our business in 2019. Up to this point, we have not experienced material cost increases from tariffs. As for those SKUs impacted, we have successfully passed the cost along in higher retails. However, a larger number of tariffs are slated to be imposed in the next couple of weeks. These tariffs should be more significant. In the short-term, we expect to be able to manage our way through any changes and we continue to expect to ultimately pass these costs along as the entire industry would be affected similarly.",0.356817,0.886

Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2019. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that our sales potential from this market will grow. Commercial continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity for the company as we currently have approximately 3% market share and we are determined to substantially grow that over time. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 32.1%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital.

For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,778,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8.8%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 21% of our total sales versus 20% last year and grew $59 million over last year's fourth quarter.

We are committed to having a great sales team supplemented with a stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident with the initiatives that we have and will have in place and we expect we will continue to gain market share in this sector. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well on a local currency basis. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 564 stores in Mexico. We again expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019.

Our plans are to grow an additional 19 stores over the next year. While Brazil is run at an operating loss, we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated.

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","For the quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 53.6% versus 52.8% the same period last year. The increase in gross margin was attributable to the impact of the sale of two business units completed during the year and higher merchandise margins partially offset by higher supply chain cost. Our supply chain expense de-leverage was mainly due to diesel fuel costs being higher. However, there was some de-leverage from the opening of the new DC in Ocala, Florida. We continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal 2019. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.",0.749728,-0.128

The increase was primarily due to the pension settlement charge of $130.3 million and domestic store payroll. While we incurred significant charges related to the termination of the pension plans in the quarter, we are pleased to have terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans, eliminated any future expenses related to those plans and most importantly eliminated all risk associated with the plan's asset performance.

The higher expense was due to higher rates we are seeing on our variable rate debt. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5 billion or approximately $75 million less than last year's balance. Our adjusted debt level metrics finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR, while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 25.4% versus last year's Q4 of 33.9% and as Bill said earlier on the call we expect the tax rate of approximately 24.5% in 2019.",0.2845484,0.511

As previously disclosed during the quarter we terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans that have been frozen since fiscal 2003. Adjusted for the charges related to the termination of the pension plans of $93.7 million net of tax, adjusted net income for the quarter increased 13.8% over the same period last year to $494 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $18.54 per share from $15.27 per share in the year ago quarter. Our diluted share count of 26.6 million was down 6.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter we generated $824 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $195 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 114 new locations. This quarter capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened we finished this quarter with 5,618 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 564 stores in Mexico and 20 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,202.",0.4553863,0.935

The company's inventory increased 1.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per location was $636,000 versus $644,000 last year and $658,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $75,000 versus the negative $48,000 last year ear and a negative $48,000 just last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 111.8%. What I would like to call out is that last year's first quarter experienced several natural disasters that impacted our sales and operating profit results. We called out 50 basis points to 60 basis points of comp tailwinds we received from the storms and $9 million of cost in last year's first quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.1%.

However, our team continued to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones. In recognition of the dedication, passion, innovation, and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that first our sales grew to a record $11.2 billion this past year.

It's a terrific question, but I knew you didn't come through that first, but I think I understand it, if I didn't get it or don't address it please clarify it for me. I think you got to look at two different things. First and foremost we made a strategic decisions on discontinuing the e-commerce promotions that didn't have anything to do with execution or transition that was a strategic decision that we made and that cost us about 40 basis point of comp. We want to make that clear, we turned them back on. We will see where we go from here. We did not want to be in a competitive disadvantage position. On the transitions we just in hindsight I think we would look back on and say we took on a disproportion amount and too much in the second half of the year. We always have vendor transitions going on and we always have distribution changes going on and hub stores and mega hubs opening we just had a little too much. And frankly several of these didn't go as planned. And they were challenging during the implementation. As we get finished with the implementation we are very excited we will be in a better competitive position and in most cases we already are. But it hurts a little bit in that six months period of time.",0.0841358,0.929

And then my second question relates to the next day delivery effort, can you talk about how you are going to fulfill these orders and what is this about what you are doing that would suggest that next day delivery should be proprietary as to you or to your channel and perhaps tougher for pure play e-commerce firms to execute if you think that that's the case?",0.7395612,0.836

I will tell you that we have a world class logistics organization that we are working with. We have been working with - on this for some time. And we are really excited to be in a position to have this differentiated offering out there. How long will it be differentiated, I think that's yet to be determined, certainly we don't know, but we are taking advantage of it. I am amazed that our organization from the time we had our first conversation about doing this. We were up and running in a store in six months, that is remarkable and a great sign of the innovation that our team can drive. And now here we are a year later than that and we have it in 83 markets and 80% of the United States population can order as late as 10 PM and get a product on their doorstep tomorrow.

And I think you guys have to figure out what you believe comp is going to be etcetera and go from there, but I would say that to reiterate some of the things Bill had talked about before is that we do expect to make some of those investments. Some of those are going to be in wage rates and some investment in technology and that will ramp during the year. And a big chunk of that was the wage rates and that will come in play towards the middle to end of Q1 and then in full force in Q2.

I think that basically you are right, we had about a 70 basis point impact this quarter I think it was about 40 basis points, last quarter with just kind of a transition in third quarter. We had 40 basis points. So when you go forward on Q1 and Q2 you would probably have something similar to what you had in Q4 and maybe little bit less. But you are right we did have some headwinds on supply chain specifically diesel fuel, so I suspect that that will continue to be a headwind for the next quarter or so. We continue to make benefits from sourcing, merchandise and organization continues to do a good job of lowering acquisition costs, etcetera. But I think that will probably be a little muted versus what it had been particularly given some of the tariffs that might be coming on place etcetera. So that's on how I think about it going forward, I think up 70 basis points or so of benefit by not having the two business units and then some headwinds in the supply chain.",0.8139282,0.779

We have charged for it in the past, a marginal amount, $1.99 and free next day delivery. Right now, it's on there at zero. Right now, we have promotions out there on certain amounts. We were going to work on modifying those over time to find the right sweet spot for our customer and for our business. As for where it's being sourced, it's being sourced from the local markets. That's the only way that you can get it there for the next day. So it's coming out of those hubs and mega hubs, which is really a great opportunity for us to activate that inventory even better. If you think about it, 3 or 4 years ago we didn't have any mega hubs.

For the latter part of that question, we have not seen August market share data completely yet, although I wouldn't expect to see it in August. I think we are really improving, I think one of the questions we got earlier was did your market share change from May to June and July. The answer is no. And I want to make this real clear. We continued to gain market share all throughout this, but we had more robust market share gains for 8 to 10 months before the February time period. What happened in February? We changed our cadence on online promotions. That clearly impacted us 40 basis points. Did this customer value perception change and did that slow us down too, maybe, maybe not. That's what we are testing to learn today. And then that's also when we started hitting these vendor transitions.

We can do it tomorrow if we knew what it would take. I think yes, we did a commercial study, a strategic review of our commercial business and we concluded it about a year ago. It came with some new concepts and we are trying some of those new concepts. And we don't know if they are going to work yet or not. We are very complicated and we are doing great things and I am proud of our team. But that's not what's driving our business today, what's driving our business today is our inventory assortment changes that we have made over the last 3 years with hubs and mega hubs and improved assortments in the satellite stores. We have also got our store management teams both the district managers and the store managers much more involved in the commercial business so that they are not thinking about DIY first and commercial second that they are coming to work every day thinking, I am the store manager of both the retail and the commercial business. And I think those things are just the blocking and tackling of what's making the improvements in our commercial business today. I certainly hope to return to 10%.

I mean, one of the things in this industry is that we are very slow churn inventory business.

I think this is a normal part of the evolution of leveraging new technologies and new innovations. As we said in the call, this is a very small part of our business and we anticipate it remaining relatively small. It's growing fast right now and we are going to accelerate it as best we can, but at the end of the day, we believe the omni-channel experience is the most important. We believe coming into our stores and engaging with our incredibly knowledgeable AutoZoners and having them help our DIY customers figure out how to maintain or repair their vehicles, is the most important part. This is just another avenue for us to meet those customers where, when, and how it's most convenient for them. So, I wouldn't overdo it, but it is a great new innovation.",1.4546376,0.97

And as we ended the third quarter, we were pretty optimistic about our sales prospects, since we were coming off the first reasonably severe winter in the last three years.

Instead two of our top performing categories were wiper blades and anti-freeze, not the categories you want leading the way in the spring. Additionally, the northeastern Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern geographies did not excel as expected after the harsher winter.

And I'd go back to what we talked about in September. This industry, our sales over the last five years have traded in a very tight band. This summer we were a little bit disappointed by them. As we move into the fourth quarter, I don't know whether we'll recoup half of them or most of them. But as we look forward, we know that there is extensive deferred maintenance, particularly on the maintenance related parts. And that maintenance work is going to have to be done at some point in time. You could see some of it was done in the commercial side with the way they were working in garages, but we just didn't see the rebound in those under car categories that we would've anticipated.",1.9589458,-0.016

So when you think about FY19 on that increase in SG&A that's a 52 to 52 week year comparison, and it excludes obviously those one-time items like the impairment charge in the pension plan termination, I think that's more one-time investment for us. Obviously, we're going to continue to make investments here and there. But those investments on wage rates and the benefits really to ensure that we've got the right AutoZoners in place and we've get a great tenured hourly AutoZoners out there, and we want to make sure that we continue to maintain that and be competitive in the marketplace.

If you recall back in 2006, we had a similar investment cycle. We were running about 17.5% operating margin at the time, and we felt like there were some things that we need to do to improve our execution for the long-term. And we invested about 50 basis points of margin at that point in time, and our margin went down to about 17. Of course over the next 10 years that improved up to about 19.4%.

I mean I think the merchandising organization has done a terrific job as far as improving the sourcing, reducing costs. The supply chain team has gotten through some assess the year on more frequent deliveries and we felt that stabilize. They've done a terrific job of opening two distribution centers over the last year. So we feel pretty bullish about gross margin, both from a merchandising cost perspective, as well as supply chain as well.

Can you tell us if that 7% if there is a big range of growth rates during the quarter, or what that was? And you mentioned expanded inventory. I wonder if you can share more detail.

Yes, 7.3% growth were commercial for the quarter, we felt pretty good about it. It was variable. It is also variable based upon week-to-week performance of the weather, but it is less variable than the DIY business. It too came out of the quarter pretty strong. As we think about the things that are driving that business, we've made tremendous investments over the last three years in making sure that we have the right delivery frequency for our cost model and optimizing our cost model, and also expanding our mega hubs, we're up to 21 mega hubs now, looking it to be at 25 by the end of the year.",2.4167573,0.97

And as we continue to roll them out, we see that the mega hub itself does very well.

And then the other thing is our team, we've spent a lot of time, particularly over the last two years, getting our in-store teams focused on the commercial business, store managers and district managers intensifying their focus on the commercial business.

There's a handful of other ones that are less significant. But I would say for the most part the investments that we have lined up for next year are pretty consistent with the way we had thought about it. And now the timing is a little bit different.

While our results for the quarter were below our expectations, the challenges seem to be broad-based across our industry and other sectors of the economy. The first few weeks of our 12-week quarter were very challenging. On our last conference call, we discussed the impact on the second quarter of the delay in income tax refunds, and that headwind continued for the first five weeks of our third quarter. Our expectations have been that much of those delayed refunds would lead to incremental store sales in Q3 but that never materialized. We don't have any empirical evidence of where those funds went but they seem to go to some other part of the economy this year. While our March sales did improve, we saw inconsistent week to week performance. It wasn't until April that we began to see stronger sales results. We can speak at length about delayed income tax refunds and the second consecutive mild winter but the more overarching thing for us was sluggish customer demand across virtually every category, resulting in disappointing sales performance during a specific eight-week period.",0.598074,-0.511

Until our second quarter, we had consistently delivered exceptional performance marked by 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth. However, there are certain factors present today that have made it more difficult to achieve similar earnings per share growth. We have made decisions to accelerate some investment in our business. We're investing at an increased rate in inventory, capital expenditures with two new domestic distribution centers under construction and we opened a second distribution center in Mexico in the fall and we've increased our operating expenses as part of our more frequent delivery and mega hub efforts.",0.5002534,0.912

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Unfortunately, as we intentionally increased our investment profile, our sales have been below our expectations each of the last two quarters. Simultaneously, we faced several other pressure points. Over the last year, we have experienced accelerated pressures on wages than we have in some time. Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain space and municipalities while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. Additionally, after several years of substantially improved shrink performance, the last two years shrink expenses turned against us. We own it and we're working it diligently but as we're moving more inventory to more locations -- our inventory availability initiatives, it's not completely surprising that are shrink results are unfavorable.",0.7617841,-0.66

All of our systems, processes and practices have been built and fine tuned for onetime a week delivery.

We have been reassessing for some time whether or not our new frequency of delivery for higher volume stores of three times a week is providing us with sufficient benefit to justify the cost. While we continue to test, current indications are steering us to lower frequencies of delivery. With these ongoing results, we are in the process of moving a significant amount of these stores to twice a week delivery and some of the lower volume stores back to once a week delivery.

Currently every sector of retail has been and likely will continue to be impacted by this new rule. We have certainly studied the ramifications and continue to do so. While some portions that our industry has migrated in part to online we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy insulates us more than most sectors of retail and over time today that has certainly proven to be the case. As we assess this, we consider the needs of our customers. When their car loan start and they need to go to work, they can't wait hours or days. When they don't know what is wrong, they can't afford to purchase multiple products. They rely on us to help them isolate the problem. Our commercial customers have to immediately turn their base because time is money.

Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 95 programs in Q4 of 2017. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow.

Some of the deceleration, as we have previously discussed, has been the result of slower growth in new programs and less maturation of stores opened in recent years. But, we haven't been pleased with our level of growth. So, we have recently embarked on a new strategic planning exercise focused solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry. We are quite pleased with tripling our sales and more than tripling our profitability in this business in the last nine years. But, what got us to this level won't necessarily get us to the next level. So, we are going to take an objective look at our approach for the next several months. We will continue to push for current performance but simultaneously explore other possibilities.

Regarding separating the comps between the weather and the tax refund, it's really difficult to do that Alan. I wish I can give you more clarity. I would like to go on little more detail on the tax refund. As we mentioned on our last call, we fully expect that those refunds have been shifted later in the cycle and we would actually see a benefit from those in Q3. For whatever reason that we don't quite understand, those refund dollars never seem to show up. I don't know -- if I went to say things, you hear some of that; as I go to remittances to Mexico, did they show up in other sectors in retail or other sectors of economy, we don't know. But it does not appear that they came into our sector in any meaningful way. And we've watched it very closely and we have monthly reporting on market share from two different sources and both of those sources continue to show that our market share gains were very similar throughout this period of time. We just had an eight-week period, three weeks in last quarter and five weeks in this quarter, we were just significantly impacted; it was kind of like when the calendar turned in April, things went back to normal like they were in the fall and early winter.",0.2022301,0.969

AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,81,Answer,2017-05-23,3,2017,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there are several things in that question, Alan. First of all, as we increase this investment profile, not only the sales get weaker but several of the things that have been industry tailwinds and our financials are macro tailwinds and our financials turned against this, so it was a little bit of a double whammy. As we look at it going forward, yes, we're going to change our cost structure where we can. The biggest question we're focused on right now is, we think there is some opportunities to decrease the multiple frequency of deliveries that we've rolled out over the last couple of years. Unfortunately, we've not been able to quantifiably see that we're getting a sufficient benefit out of that. So, we're going to continue to test and take some of these stores down to two times a week, we can set a three times a week and hopefully make a final decision in the next six months or so on where we will be long-term. We will pull back some of those costs. What we won't do is pulling back cost at the point we're not providing great service to our customers. We're in this for the long-term and sometimes we're going to have periods of little bit weakness and sometimes going to have great periods of strength.

And then, related to that, is the run rate that you are seeing today, because you did mention May, does that -- do you feel like it resolved the debate, whether the industry is healthy, there was just a bunch of noise?

When we talked about May, we were talking about May that we was still in the same part of our portal. As we think about the sales environment, what we noticed was there was a very distinct eight-week period of time where it acted very differently. Go back to the fall, September through mid-January, it was pretty consistent. Now, we have fluctuations week-to-week and you asked about in April that we see fluctuations. Of course, we do because the weather patterns in April are so different. But the expectations week to week based upon the weather that we were experiencing was more consistent with our expectations.

Looking back at it, do you feel like it's explainable by a bunch of these small things or relatively large things? And you mentioned, you are requisitioning a lot of things and some of it is strategic but on the industry as a macro, can you share with us what your requisitioning, what we should be thinking through just given some of the bumps that this industry, which is not normally used to it has experienced over the last year or so?",0.0128323,0.687

So, as I think about the industry sales environment and when I think about AutoZone's sales performance over the last year as compared to other years, we have come off to very, very mild winters. I have mentioned it in the prepared remarks, what we have experienced over of two year period of time in the Northeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic is alarming. I don't think that has anything to be with what's going on in those markets. I think it has to do with what's going on with the weather pattern. We can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice, salt potholes, mainly under car items. So, I think very strong as that has as impacted our industry's performance. And then, this whole tax refund thing, this year, it was just a tremendous anomaly. I can't explain it; I don't know where those dollars went but that has been such a big driver of our industry sales over the last five or six years and it just went away this year, it was non-existent.",0.3679676,0.721

They decelerated because we were doing a lot of things on opening new programs and our sales were benefiting from that.

We feel really good about the mega hubs and the results that we have had. And you are spot on that there are some real estate constrains relative to our ability to open up more and more mega hubs. You will see us continue to open up mega hubs and the speed at which that we open them up will be somewhat contingent upon finding the right available real estate in order to do that from more frequent delivery standpoint. Look, we are an analytically driven company, and if we do not see the benefits from the investments that we are making, we are going to make adjustments to that. So from that perspective, yes, we believe that we will basically reduce expenses from that perspective in the future as we make adjustments to that.",0.8236189,0.823

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's a host of those things but frankly you have hit on the right one, sales can be a big driver, distance, number of stores on a route et cetera. So there will be a number of factors there. But sales are going to be heavily weighted, because again we have adequate return on the investment dollars that we are putting forth and right now we don't believe that we are not going to make adjustments to it.",0.9726305,0.625
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,94,Question,2017-05-23,3,2017,Matt Fassler,Goldman Sachs,"My first question relates to your thought process on the economics of some the investments that you necessarily -- you might want to pull back. What's the ROI, the financial ROI calculation that you have done to determine whether it works for you? And if you do back away, where would we see some of the investment, would it be gross margin, SG&A, CapEx et cetera?",1.3733192,-0.487
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,95,Answer,2017-05-23,3,2017,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. Matt, it's not as much an ROI calculation because the capital that we are deploying to do this is not that significant. We are opening these two distribution centers, not because of multiple frequency of delivery, but because we need an incremental distribution capacity. But this is more about how are we going to -- better than a breakeven on the sales environment for the operating expense increases that we have experienced. So, the vast majority of the difference will be seen in gross margins; there will be a little bit of it in the SG&A but most of it will be in gross margins.",0.3193689,-0.599
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,96,Question,2017-05-23,3,2017,Matt Fassler,Goldman Sachs,Is that a function of the frequency of truck runs diminishing and consequently the supply chain cost coming down?,0.9090587,0.0
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,97,Answer,2017-05-23,3,2017,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes, it's predominantly supply chain; it's truck runs but it's also extra tours to the distribution centers, so labor in the DCs.",0.8095756,0.214
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,98,Question,2017-05-23,3,2017,Matt Fassler,Goldman Sachs,"And do you feel like there is any -- I mean obviously there is a trade off, do you feel like there has been some sales benefits to you from this that would dissipate or do you feel like it hasn't really moved the needle?",0.8651805,0.844
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,99,Answer,2017-05-23,3,2017,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there has been some very minor improvements in sales which would go away, but it's not material, unfortunately. If it was, we continue to do it. And I want to be careful here. We have not made final decisions. This is a very complicated analysis to do. So, we are still doing some work over the next several months to figure out what the right frequency for us is. One of the things we are realizing is that many years ago in our hub stores, we started doing kind of feeder replenishment out of those stores to the outlined store that they service and so that's one of the reason we are not getting the same kind of benefits out of the multiple frequency of delivery. We were already [indiscernible] highest probability SKUs that we sell; so that benefit didn't exists for us.",1.2280791,0.92
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,100,Question,2017-05-23,3,2017,Matt Fassler,Goldman Sachs,"And then, my second question, speaking about what changed this quarter, if we look at sales per store or kind of back into comp, DIY didn't really decelerate, almost all of the deceleration related to commercial. How should we dimensionalize that as you think about both the macro factors you discussed related to taxes and whether -- and also to some of the changes in investment posture they have for that space? And do you agree with my read of the numbers by the way?",1.2473461,0.433
AZO-2017-Q3-2017-05-23,101,Answer,2017-05-23,3,2017,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I agree with your read of the numbers versus last quarter but you remember, last quarter got killed at the end, particularly DIY. So, I think both businesses have been impacted during that eight-week period of time pretty significantly. And our commercial business has decelerated more than we would have expected. By the way that's why we're going back and taken another strategic look at commercial. I'm really excited about what we're going to be doing. It's going to take us some time but we're going to take a fresh look at what we're doing in commercial and what are our long-term strategies there.",0.1723264,0.647

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I would say, the core base business continues to do well, if you just look at it on a local currency basis, the business continues to perform strong. We're very pleased with what the team has done down there et cetera; from a foreign currency exchange impact on our EPS growth rate, it is probably a little less than 1% of an impact from a growth rate prospective. So, it continues to be a bit of a headwind. So, for us, it's really about the exchange rate; there is not a lot of strategies that we're necessary going to change. We feel pretty good about the position of Mexico, we're excited about 500th store opening as Bill mentioned earlier. So that business continues to go well but hopefully the peso will turn around a little bit in future.",0.3558215,0.935

I would say actually we feel really good about what the merchandising organization has done relative to continuing to find opportunities to lower acquisition costs. We mentioned a couple of quarters ago about our activity around direct importing and we continue to increase that. So, the team has done a nice job there, continuing to increase that. So, I feel really good about the health of the gross margin rate today and going forward. It may be a little bit less but it's still very healthy and it's very well positioned. So, we have a couple of very identifiable expense items that are putting some headwind on gross margin, both of which we believe are just near-term headwinds and we will be able to work our way through those. But lowering acquisition costs is something that we think is there for a while.",0.3520131,0.78

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to get into what's going to happen as we go into individual quarter comparisons but I'll go into what your original question is. What has changed with the macro outlook for sales in this industry over the long term? I would answer that absolutely nothing. We had an eight-week period of time, which we believe we can very easily attribute to the tax refund delays and two mild winters.

What I'll tell you is I think the industry performance over the long term has not changed by any significant level. And the one challenge that we have in our sales performance compared to what it's been over the last five years is that our commercial business is not growing at the same rate that it was growing before as we opened all those new programs. We have to take that on and we have to find ways to accelerate the market share gains that we are already getting in commercial.

I did highlight, in the short-term, we have a disproportionate amount of things, some of which are decisions we have made or things we have done to ourselves and some of them are kind of a disproportionate amount of macros things that are current and are headwinds for us. I think in the intermediate term, we have some more challenges to get to those numbers.

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I think as we move forward, we expect that number to hang where it is little bit, maybe come down a little. You saw that came down consecutively from last quarter on a per store basis. So, inventory levels are little bit higher than we would have desired; some of that was sales related; some of that also is some of the activities that have relative to opening up mega hubs, direct import activity et cetera. So, some of that is for good reasons. But, we expect it to moderate going forward.",0.3781284,0.494

Regarding those macro trends that you talked about, regarding unemployment and increased gas prices, the only time we've really seen unemployment be a key driver of our performance is when it has been significant increases like during the great recession. And for whatever reason that seems to be a driver of our business rather detractor of our business. On gas prices, clearly, we want them to be as low as possible. But the only time we've really seen -- or call them out as material contributors to our success or headwinds for us, have been when they really got up around $4 a gallon.

We will be adding mega hubs in smaller markets than we envisioned originally and will also be adding to density in some of the largest markets. As we said all along, since we've introduced these mega hubs, they continually have outperformed our expectations. So frankly, the analysis that we did four years or five years ago when we started them, said, we can only do 25 to 40 as they - as their performance has improved, they've allowed us to go to these other markets.",0.887481,0.836

As you know in this business, weather matters, especially on a weekly or geographic area - certain geographies. I don't want to spend too much time on it. We feel confident that we're continuing to build momentum in the commercial business. Now, when you talk about comps, we are up against tougher commercial growth in the fourth quarter of last year.

Because you have momentum in the business, in the commercial business and you're densing up these markets. Can you talk about the cost and I guess the presumption is - it feels like the incremental cost here, could be a little bit less, because these are more fold out as you dense up market, is that a fair assumption? And can you just talk about the cost in general?",0.2796988,0.861

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, first of all, I think, as we've rolled out the ones that we have to-date, we haven't called out the mega hub cost is a significant contributor to our cost structure. Clearly, it's more expensive. The first ones that we did, we were able to go into - in many cases existing excess space that we already had. As we go to the next ones, we'll be having to take down a little bit more real estate or additional lease space next to a store that we already have. So there will be costs, but I don't think, it'll be meaningful costs that we're calling out as a key contributor to our performance.",0.3390775,0.723
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,52,Question,2019-05-21,3,2019,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"Okay. And then my follow-up is on gross margin, Bill, you just mentioned that you should still benefit somewhat from lower acquisition costs. But does the mix of commercial over - offset that, such that the gross margin should now decline. And then in general, is there a relationship between some rate of the commercial sales growth to GM that sort of proportional as we think about as the commercial business continues to grow rapidly.",0.1386199,-0.159

I think that it will be a function of how fast commercial continues to grow. So that will continue to put a little bit of pressure on us. Look the way we think about it is our margin overall is relatively healthy across our businesses. We continue to have opportunities to improve it, but we recognize that the - one of our lower margin business is growing significantly faster and we're thrilled with that. That's exactly our objective and that's exactly what we're trying to accomplish.",0.5174102,0.914
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,58,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, as we expand from 25 to 40 to 70 to 90 mega hubs, it's not going to add a substantial amount, of additional stores to have access to that inventory. Over 90% of our stores today have access to the mega hub inventory. What it will do is it will shorten the lead time, many of those stores today will get it on 3 time a day basis, some of them will get it once a day basis and others will get it overnight. As we expand this, we will go to more stores that have access 3 times a day and fewer stores that have access overnight. But there will always be stores that have access overnight, because they are simply too far from the mega hub. I think what held us back. Frankly, we would love to be farther along the mega hubs today that the big challenge with this is, these are big boxes and they take time to get them to find the right real estate and to develop that real estate. We will have the same experience as we go from our 28 today up to 70 to 90 mega hubs. It will take us some time. I would say what changed was the economics changed. We are getting more productivity out of the existing box of the mega hub itself and we're getting more productivity out of the stores that are adjacent and feeding off of that box, particularly the stores that have access 3 times a day or in the local market. So just the economies - the economics changed and made it more beneficial for us to do it.",1.3223517,0.941

Keep in mind that many of the investments that we've put in place last year really kicked in at the very end of Q1 of this year. So, we will wrap that around a little bit in Q1, but yes, I think that the investments will peak out a little bit this year and we'll continue to moderate as we move forward.",0.2225245,0.66

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I do think if I can add on the I do think, and I've commented earlier, we are going to have increased technology spending for the foreseeable future. And today, I think we are also continuing to see that the wage market is probably different than it was five to seven years ago because you have the regulated markets that are continuing to march toward $15 an hour and then you have other markets that there are market pressures from other retailers that are moving those wages up. So, I think, we will continue to have not at the level that we experienced this year, but I believe, we will continue to have wage pressures and information technology accelerated spending.",0.5458692,-0.468

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes, I would say that probably one of the primary things that we're focused on is making sure that we are easy to do business with and so, whether that be returning products, paying bills, looking at account information, making sure they have all the product information that they need, their history, etcetera. That's probably the first place we're starting. We always have opportunities to be able to introduce new customers to pricing depending on their spending level and so a new customer may be able to get better pricing, if they have a commitment on certain spending level not unlike existing customers as well. So, there's opportunities for those, but the bigger play is really our ability to connect with the customer, have a more personal relationship with them, both electronically as well as having our field people out talking to the commercial customers every day and being able to be an easier place to do business with.",0.2323177,0.976

AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,75,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific question, Brian. I would tell you that it's the culmination of about four years worth of very focused work. If you recall, we reupped our strategy in 2008 and had a nice run with that and then about four years ago, we knew we had to come up with the next leg of what our strategy looks like. We did a tremendous amount of work, most focused on improving our product assortments, leaning into the commercial business. We did things like multiple frequency of delivery we expanded and improved the assortment that we have in our satellite stores and in our hub stores. We added mega hubs which we didn't have four, five years ago and on and on. We've really improved the product assortments, focused very much on commercial. Then over the last year and we're beginning to annualize that right now, we really ramped up the engagement of our store operating teams. I will put our operating teams up against anybody out there, they can execute like nobody's business and we really take that execution focus and dialed it into commercial, where before for the most part, the Commercial Sales Manager and the TSM were the direct contact with the customers, now we've enhanced that, by adding the Store Manager and the District Managers. And our Store Managers are phenomenal customer service people and when they're going out making these sales calls, they're finding out what are we doing right and where do we have opportunities for improvement, and they're coming back and leading the store team in that direction. So that's to us what is enhanced our performance.",0.2802838,0.99

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll start with the latter question, not that I can think of off the top of my head and we have dealt with over many, many years significant increases because so many of the products we sell are significant commodity-based products. So, we've dealt with oil shocks, we've dealt with lead price increases, we've dealt with steel price increases. Many times, those have come pretty quick and we have been able to pass those cost along to our consumers. But let me be the first to say, we are not pleased about the tariffs. We are concerned about what that will do not so much to AutoZone or our business, but more to what it would mean to the U.S. economy. But we have a strong history of being able to say, OK, we can pass those on to our customers. It's one of the beauties of being in a relatively inelastic demand business.",0.6989356,0.933

We have a significant amount, of products that come out of China. We don't direct import a ton, less than 10%, but we have a lot of importers that bring it in from China and then we also have a lot of our products where the components are being manufactured in China and the products are being assembled here. So, we have significant exposure to products that are sourced from China whether we do it or somebody else does it.",0.5717182,0.372

I thought it is 100 to 150 basis points between those ones that we highlighted and the ones that we didn't. But otherwise, I would say, for the most part, take the big geographic areas of the country, it was pretty healthy across most of the country. So it was pretty encouraging.",0.1044614,0.963

Obviously, we're growing both in the commercial side of the business. Our DIY traffic and ticket trends were not significantly different than they have been. We have a long-standing challenge with transaction count and that's being made up with a long-standing growth in average ticket. Those trends were not meaningfully different this quarter than they have been.",0.4850482,0.743

We turned them off, I think around February 1st, and we turned it back on in the latter part of August. And there still stay on today. The FedEx next-day delivery program has really been a great addition to us. It's not the biggest program, I said in our prepared remarks, that our total digital business is less than 5%, substantially less, but it's been a nice addition and it's been a great way for us to surprise and delight customers. So, we've been very pleased with that.",1.4916371,0.982
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,103,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific question. Yes. First on the commercial side, it's pretty clear that we're taking substantial market share. The market has grown 4%, 4.5% and we are growing close to 15% and that's a pretty significant change. And a lot of focus on the commercial side comes, what's happening with us and our close end competitors. I would change the dialog, if you added the big three together, we only have about 10% market share. There is 90% of other market share out there and to me, that's where our focus needs to be is how do we enhance our position so that we can grab more and more of that market share over time. And I think the mega hubs play perfectly into that as we are substantially changing our product assortment in the local market, that's taking away an advantage that was typically held by the warehouse distributors. On the retail side, we are continuing to see that our share gains are accelerating, they are not massive, but they are accelerating. Clearly, the entire industry has taken share away from the mom and pops over a long period of time. If you look at the number of outlets that sell parts in the United States, it's been around 35,000 outlets since I got in this business almost 25 years ago, that doesn't change - what doesn't change even though us and our competitors are opening more and more programs, there is a natural consolidation that happens on the independent side. Will it continue for the future? We certainly hope so.",0.1976685,0.99
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,105,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes, I think it all goes into the same bucket. I mean, it's an input cost to overall costs and it will probably contribute to general inflation if we see a lot of wage pressure, it won't be just about AutoZone, but probably be general inflation across the U.S. industries. So again, history would imply that we have some successful both individually as an industry and passing along increased cost to the consumers. So, that's how we will continue to focus on, but yes, there will continue to be cost pressures whether it would be wage rates, interest rates, utility cost or whatever.",0.8139282,0.929
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,110,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. Keep in mind, when it was 90 and 115 basis points, you had probably about a 70 basis point plus impact from AutoAnything and IMC, but I hear the question. So I would say that yes, some of it was product mix as well and some of it as customer mix as well within commercial. But I would say overall that our margin was probably a little below of what we expected, but not significantly. So we would expect it to be a little bit of pressure as the commercial business continues to grow and we expect to find opportunities to try to offset that with improvements through our merchandising organization.",0.7883569,0.928
AZO-2019-Q3-2019-05-21,112,Answer,2019-05-21,3,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say first of all that in the 2017 and 2018 time period, there was a lot of focus on the fact that our sales trajectory had changed radically and I have spent a lot of time talking about how tight the band of our sales performance has been since 2013. It's really within a couple of 100 basis points. We are going to have really good quarters and we are going to have more challenging quarters, but they are still going to be within a pretty tight band. The one difference that we have today and we will see if it's sustainable or not is we are growing our commercial business at a much accelerated rate. You talk about 2017 and '18 we went down into single-digit growth there. Now that we have had it in double-digits and this time close to 15%, that's making a meaningful difference. We will have to see if we can sustain that level or even continue to grow it from here. That will be the question.",1.0805879,0.941

But at specific times in markets or region, weather matters. Extreme heat and cold causes premature failure of parts and also accelerates the deterioration of maintenance parts. And in the spring and fall when temperatures are milder, most deferred maintenance gets done, if the weather is favorable. Fiscal 2016 and '17 had very mild winters and our industry sales were softer than the couple of years before or last year.

The 10% tariffs were expanded to broader and broader categories. We did not see a material cost increase from these tariffs in fiscal 2018 or in our first quarter, because we were able to negotiate and offset some of the tariffs away based on the strength of the US dollar. Looking forward, the US has agreed to postpone plans to increase tariffs from 10% to 25%. We will continue to monitor developments closely and working with our industry associations to share our concerns about the potential negative ramifications of ongoing and increased tariffs to our customers and the broader economy. That said, our industry has much lower elasticity of demand than most other retailer distribution sectors.

So while challenging, the size of the prize is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 90 basis points from last year's first quarter.

SG&A expense for the quarter was 35.2% of sales, higher by 54 basis points from last year's fiscal quarter. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were higher than last year, primarily due to the planned increase in domestic store payroll.

Net income of the quarter was $351.4 million, up 25.1% over last year. Our diluted share count of 26.1 million was down 7.1% from last year's first quarter.

As we mentioned in the last call, in the second half of the last year, our execution wasn't up to our standard across the enterprise and we, as a senior management team and across the organization, really re-dedicated ourselves to customer service across the organization and on the commercial side, the biggest thing that we've done is we've enhanced the engagement of the local store team and particularly the store manager.

I would say that we have seen very moderate inflation overall, but we are seeing a little bit. And so, I would say some of our margin benefit this year continues to be the great work that our merchandising organization is doing at lowering acquisition costs across the board and our ability to continue to pass on retail pricing where appropriate for products that do experience some cost inflation. From a tariff respective, we haven't seen a significant impact on this first round of tariffs. And obviously, the Chinese currency was devalued, so there was some opportunity for us to mitigate some of those tariff increases, but I think our merchandising organization has done a great job of mitigating that.

They need to figure out what do they need to fix, how do they fix it, do they need the tools, do they need to fix finders, all those things, that's what drives them into the store and that's why this is the perfect channel in my opinion for an omnichannel experience, not just an online experience.",1.064369,0.952

Yes, we went from 80% of the US population to 85% of the US population, including Puerto Rico. I would not expect us to get to 100% and I would think that our growth from here would be fairly limited, because you're talking about less dense areas of the United States. Is it continuing to grow? Absolutely. It's also, I would say, a minuscule part of our business today.",0.5570198,0.934

It is a really good offering for a customer who needs that service and we are certainly the only ones in our sector and frankly probably leading all of retail for a customer to be able to order something as late as 10 PM and have it on their doorstep the next day. But it is again a very small part of our business. I hope it grows and I hope that it satisfies customers and meet some of their needs that couldn't be met yesterday.,0.6234161,0.93

That seems to be more certain this year than it was a couple of years ago. The real question is, what are people's withholding rates going to be versus the tax credits that they're getting and this is all a brand new world for everybody. So I don't think we have very good visibility into what that's going to mean. At the end of the day, I can't do anything about it except market into it.

What we have done and again, you have to remember, we did grow up as a retailer. We were a retailer long before we ever got in the wholesale business and most of our management team grew up as retail first, I call it, when they think, they're fastball, it's retail. So one of the things we don't over the last, I guess, starting in the fourth quarter is, we started getting our store managers to make sales calls directly to the customers.",0.4014192,0.361

You mentioned, I think, last quarter that the removal of promotions online had hurt comps by 40 bps. Is it fair to assume that putting them back on sort of gave you that -- part of that reacceleration or does it take time for that to kind of come back? And then I had a follow up?",0.239758,0.394

That was the direct portion and I would say it absolutely came right back. So yes, that was a difference. The question that we had that really is very difficult to answer is there's a lot of customers that are going to our website and our competitors' websites to look for pricing and availability. If we're out there, without a promotion and others are out there with a promotion, does a customer dig deeper into the website, because of a price perception and therefore even though they're doing in-store purchases, do they -- do we get at a disadvantage about not being that promotional effort? I don't know what the answer to that is. So it's definitely at least 40 basis points. It could be more than that.",0.0484222,0.369

Obviously, you're right. The next round is going to be broader, if it does happen, and obviously, at a higher rate. So there will be some impact from that.

You have to remember, our market share is only 3% in the commercial business and I think what we do dwarfs anything that's going on in the macro environment. And if you look at the succession of our growth the last three quarters, we've accelerated the growth and basically doubled where we were about a year ago. I don't think there's anything in the macro that would be contributing to that.

If we look at the work that we've done over the last three years on inventory availability, our ability to say yes to our commercial customers needs is vastly different than it was a few years ago.

We were up 16.5%, then up 11.4%, ending up 8.8% in the last four weeks.

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 13.1%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,960,000.

For the first quarter, our domestic do-it-for-me or DIFM sales increased 11.9% to $695 million, another strong quarter for us. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 22% of our total sales and increased approximately $75 million from last year's Q1. Our weekly sales per program were $11,500, up 9.2% on a per-program basis versus $10,600 per week last year.

This past year, we believe we grew share and remain focused on repeating this for FY2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts offering, many in the Duralast brand, improvements in our parts coverage by model year and a commitment to providing exceptional service.

AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,88,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for the question Bret. On the commercial side of the business, you've seen the publicly available numbers and I think first of all, we're at the top of the heap in both the retail and commercial businesses with our public peers. So I think we're doing very well there.",0.9204257,0.69
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,89,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Regarding your specific question on WDs, clearly during the worst of times back in Q3, we were in a very different position than some of our smaller competitors. They really shut things down, many of them closed or work reduced hours had less inventory and the like. And I think that that gave us a real opportunity to introduce ourselves and be there for certain customers, that maybe we didn't have the same relationship before.",0.6153066,0.612
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,90,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we've said many, many times the commercial part of this business certainly is a relationship business. And when you're there for customers, you build up some credibility that you can leverage for a long time. So I think that's the bigger issue rather than them getting back to where their normal operating procedures are, that we were there in people's times of need. And I think that people have long memories about that.",1.4561581,0.34
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,91,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the retail side of the business, again, I think we're performing at the highest level of any of our public peers. But I also think that there are other parts of the channel, other channels in the retail sector, mass and online that we did particularly well against during this period of time and continue to do so. Again, I think, is it sustainable or not? That's the biggest charge that we have as a management team. We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to new customers.",1.2356817,0.685
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,92,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And as we said in our prepared remarks, much of our business growth in the retail business is coming from existing customers who are doing more business with us. And I think it's very encouraging that we're - they're participating with us in different categories than they normally do. And so we feel very good about that.",2.2458186,0.886
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,94,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I wish I had better information to answer that question, Bret. We have very specific information on the sales floor categories in our retail business. We don't have that level of information on the commercial business. So we have to - like everybody else look pretty much at the topline numbers and try to extrapolate from there, but we feel like we're doing well. I can't tell you how the WDs are doing as a whole.",1.7516472,0.883
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,98,Question,2020-12-08,1,2021,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"Hey. Good morning, everyone. And I wish Bill Giles a good send-off again. I think we did it last quarter, but there was a nice message from Bill Rhodes. My first question is on price. I think we've talked about investing in price a little more prominently in the last couple of quarters. Can we talk about the rationale? Any specific areas you're trying to address? Is it price spreads online? Is it DIY, DIFM? And then can you talk big picture around the elasticity of demand? I'm assuming it's not for short-term gains because a lot of the demand is failure base, but how do you think about that?",0.0790687,-0.31
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,99,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes. This is Jamere. What I'll say is a couple of things. First of all, we control our own destiny here. In the results, as it relates to our gross margins, are not a result of cost pressures or pricing spirals within the industry. What we're doing is we're investing in a disciplined way to improve our competitive positioning. We're improving our overall profitability. And in many ways the productivity we're achieving in operating expenses serves as a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making.",1.7337278,0.7
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,100,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"What I'll say about pricing is that we're making decisions on pricing, merchandising and investments based on data and discipline. And these are decisions that are resulting in both share gains and higher overall earnings. So I like the playbook that we have is that as it relates to the pricing.",1.7380312,0.75
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,101,Question,2020-12-08,1,2021,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"Okay. Thanks for that. Let me ask you maybe a follow-up on stock buyback. I think you mentioned, you may exceed, I guess historic levels. And I think the last amount that you purchased was something in the $2 billion category or $2 billion level on a peak basis. So I mean, is there any way are you planning to eclipse that target? And then, would you take up your leverage short-term? Would it have any impact vis-à-vis the rating agencies? Can you take your leverage up to buyback an outsized amount?",0.0517135,0.697
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,102,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"Yes. So let me say this. I mean, this is perhaps one of the most powerful free cash flow stories really in all of industry. And the business model that we have enables us to invest in a disciplined way in growth and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in a very consistent and efficient way. And so what we recognized is that, this model is powerful enough from a cash flow standpoint for us to do that investment in a growth of our business and continue along the journey that we've been, returning meaningful amounts of cash and what the free cash flow that we generate. So we don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of leverage and we also don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of moving off the center line that we have for this disciplined capital allocation strategy.",0.2339968,0.98

A lot of attention gets focused on our close end competitors and rightfully so, and they both outperform us on a sales per program basis and have for a long time. I'm really pleased with what our team has been able to do to begin closing that gap. But we really don't want to get too focused on our close end competitors. We want to think about the industry as a whole.",1.0187532,0.929

It is incredibly fragmented, much more so fragmented than the retail side of the business. So I want to make sure that we're focused on the entire market, not our close end competitors.

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We now have built this fabulous brand called the Duralast brand, which five to seven years ago, people thought it was an inhibitor to our success. Now, everybody else sees it as a real key part and a leverage point for us in the commercial business. Think about the other national brands at a decade ago were so powerful. Many of them are gone. Those that are still around are less relevant today than they were back then. And now we've also built this really strong salesforce, which we didn't have a decade ago.",1.916371,0.939

I'll answer it the normal way because we release our earnings so quick in the quarter, so we're two weeks and three days into this quarter. We don't want to talk about what's happening this quarter because we don't want our owners to get focused on two and a half week periods of time. So historically, we have not talked about what's happened inter quarter and we're not going to do that today.",1.1393817,0.869
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,113,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We were very specific in showing you what happened in each four-week period during the quarter. We don't generally give that level of clarity either. I want to remind us coming into Q4 that we told you we were up 16.5% in the last four weeks of last quarter. I told you today that we were up 16.5%, the first four-week period. I think a lot of people thought our sales had gone down materially in September, and that wasn't true.",2.0501774,0.7
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,114,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Regarding that 8.8 that we had in the last four-week period of time. We were very intentional in saying, yes, the election was going on. We also - in this period of time, sales are driven up and down based upon weather patterns. We get a cold snap, it can be very positive. We get very rainy weather, it can be very negative. So we've given you the cadence. It's very hard for us to talk about and even understand what the next 12 weeks is going to be like, we don't know. These are unprecedented levels. 12.3% same-store sales is the best performance in this company since I've joined the company over 26 years ago. It will slow down over time. How fast that happened? I don't know. But I do know we have an incredibly strong business that regardless will continue to outperform over the long-term.",2.0283832,0.891

There's no question about it. I've said it - I've just said it. This is the second best quarter since I've been at the company. The best quarter was last quarter. Will we be able to comp 21.8% same-store sales in Q4? I highly doubt it. Will we give some of that back? Absolutely. The question is, will we give it all back? Are we introducing ourselves to new customers? Or introducing existing customers to new categories for us? Are we kind of standing in that gap for customers? I think we are. And I think we're going to build loyalty with our customers over the long-term.",1.3659402,0.952

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","My real question for us is if we had this pandemic, what would our sales have been two years from now? I'm sorry, there's a train outside of the room. If we had this pandemic and you moved forward two years from now and we have 2%, 3%, 4% increase in business that we would have had the pandemic not happen. I think that's a distinct possibility.

AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,124,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I would just jump in and say that look from a gross perspective, it's down two quarters in a row, but frankly, a big chunk of this one was one-time. So you've got a little bit of pressure on some of the things that Jamere pointed out, for example, on loyalty. That's a great example of the fact that to follow on what Bill was talking about, is that we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore we're seeing a tremendous amount of new and existing customers. Our existing customers are visiting us more and they're building up more loyalty points. That's fantastic.",1.2274211,0.962
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,125,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","As we talk about pricing and think about pricing and we're going to be incredibly surgical about it. As Jamere said, it's going to be very data-driven. And at the end of the day, this is about driving gross profit dollars. Ultimately that is what we are most focused on is driving dollars.",1.249728,0.401
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,126,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","And as you can see, we're improving operating margin overall because we're leveraging our fixed cost structure based on the sales that we are generating from all of our activities and pricing is just a small example of one of those activities. But I think overall, the way I think about it is, look, I think our gross margin is very healthy. I think it's completely in our control. We have opportunities to improve and reduce our cost through importing, increasing our importing, lowering our acquisition cost. And as Jamere pointed out, we have an opportunity to be surgical about how we price. And so I think there's a lot of pluses and minuses in gross margin. And right now, they're all working to drive sales and drive profits.",2.2295974,0.831
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,127,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,Jamere Jackson,CFO,"And the only thing I'll add is, you've talked a little bit about operating expenses and wage pressure. You saw this last quarter, our teams did an outstanding job of really driving productivity and we run the productivity play with intensity inside the company, and we've been able to manage our labor costs sort of in line with volume. There will be pockets of wage pressure, as you mentioned in certain regions, but quite frankly, we're committed to investing in our AutoZoners regardless of what happens with the regulatory environment. And quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're so good at driving productivity inside of the company. So again, we control our own destiny as it relates to these things and we're going to invest in a disciplined way to move the needle on earnings as a whole.",2.2996235,0.894
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,134,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Another fantastic question. Thank you. As you look at the commercial business, you're exactly right, that miles driven are down and they've been down for a period of time. I would also tell you that another thing that's muting the commercial business is the lack of winter that we had last year. Tire sales were down. Maintenance sales were down, brakes, rotors, which I've talked about specifically in the prepared remarks. The other thing that's happening in that sector is the independent part of the sector is performing much better today than the national accounts, if you will. And I think those things will change over time.",1.1632032,0.883
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,135,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As you see, we get back into a normal weather pattern, but again, we're having this opportunity to introduce ourselves, particularly to some of these up and down the street accounts at a different level than we have on the past. I don't believe that people are ""returning to work"". We don't see it yet in a significant miles driven improvement. It improved vastly in the summertime, but then it's kind of been fairly steady over the recent months we've seen. But I'll remind you that not all miles driven are the same.",1.8803852,0.941
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,136,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So people that are driving to work in some of these urban cores, generally aren't our core customer. Our core customer has not had the luxury just like our AutoZoners that are in the stores and the distribution centers. Our core customer doesn't have the luxury to work from home. They're doing manual labor. They're providing service economy kind of jobs. And so I don't think that our core customers really seen a significant change in their driving behaviors.",0.7577293,0.554
AZO-2021-Q1-2020-12-08,138,Answer,2020-12-08,1,2021,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a very fair way to think about it. And I'll just remind you, when we got serious about the commercial business was 2008. We were doing about $750 million annually at that point in time. In the last 12 years, we've more than tripled the business, getting close to quadruple in the business. And it's been pretty darn sticky along the way. That's certainly our hope. And as we're launching many of these new initiatives that are only going to amplify our service advantage, as we've now shored up our inventory assortments, we've built this brand and we've got somebody telling our story and our salesforce, we feel pretty good about the future. Will it be a straight line? No, it never is. But we've had a pretty strong trajectory over the last 12 years of growing that business much faster than the industry has grown.",1.363406,0.974

We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives.

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology",On the cost front we highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments we have made specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments which negatively impacted operating expenses. For the quarter we want to remind financial milers that SG&A dollars will be up similarly as a growth percentage to this past quarter as we began the wage rate investments in the later part of Q1 last year.,0.4281828,0.44

At quarter end we had $477 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress we managed through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.,0.2883569,0.751

So Bill Giles I think you mentioned that our gross margin should be similar going forward I think to recent trends and I think you also said you want to make improvement. So can you reconcile those two and then in terms of the time frame that we should extrapolate that, is that for Q1 or is that for the whole year? And then as tariffs roll in does it make it harder to show improvement in that trend line or it all depends on the elasticity?",0.1354695,0.74
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,53,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Well, that's a good question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. We always believe that we have opportunity to improve our gross margin. We're always looking for opportunities to improve sourcing so that we can lower our cost. And then as Bill mentioned before we recognize that the Duralast brand is an incredibly strong brand and there are further opportunities for us to continue to roll that across other categories as we continue to evolve that brand. Secondly, I would say that I'm thinking more on a shorter-term basis and not trying to extrapolate out the entire year but as we continue to accelerate our commercial business at a double-digit rate that's going to continue to apply pressure on gross margin. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about it and the impact this quarter was around 20 basis points or so. So we're all about growing the business, we're all about gross margin dollars and EBIT growth and that's our primary focus. And we'll let the margin -- we will continue to manage the margin hard and we'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce cost. But as our commercial business grows that will continue to put a little pressure on our absolute gross margin rate.",0.164309,-0.503
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,54,Question,2019-09-24,4,2019,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,"Got it, okay, that's helpful. My follow-up is on SG&A and I guess trading profit for growth maybe. So you stepped up a lot in fiscal 2019 and you seem to be getting a pretty good return. And you've invested on a steady pace over time. Are you debating whether it makes sense to spend even at a higher rate and trade a little more profit for growth?",0.0112955,0.953
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,55,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I would say that the investments that we've made have been very specific and very targeted. So our investments to this point have been on wage adjustments that we believe were appropriate and we believe we're getting benefit from those wage adjustments. As we move forward we recognize that we will continue to have some wage pressure mostly from regulatory activity that is taking place across the country. So we recognize that wages will continue to be a little bit of a pressure point maybe not as high as it was when we proactively invested in wages. And then technology and that's a smaller component but it's still an investment. And so those are the specific areas and we will continue to invest in technology and as Bill mentioned in our prepared remarks last year was probably one of the highest years we've spent on technology and we expect to continue to invest even more in technology as we move forward. So those are the two areas and yes, you're right, we will play in the environment that we are in and sales have been strong and we've been able to manage our way through that and continue to generate earnings results.",0.7208923,0.922

AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,59,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, terrific question. First of all we were very excited about the growth that we had in the commercial business across all different customer segments. I did say in our prepared remarks that the up and down the street customer which are those small mom and pops grew at a faster rate than the rest of the commercial business. And we want to make that point clear to make sure you know that this is a widespread growth. Our growth in mature customer sales I also said was at an all time high level. So we were very excited about how it came across different markets, different customer segments just across the board which tells us that all the different things that we're working on from getting our store managers and district managers more engaged to the hub initiatives that we've had, to the inventory initiatives that they're all working in tandem which is exactly what we were hopeful of.",0.3046123,0.984
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,61,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yeah, I would say that the 7.5% is the right number to think about and give you more update as we move along through the year. But certainly for the next quarter that's the way I would be thinking about it. Relative to what we did last year and how we're thinking about it moving forward and as I said I think we'll continue to invest in wages much of it will be in response to regulatory pressures. And then we will continue to escalate some of our technology investments and they will occur both on the commercial side of the business and the retail side of the business. We have made some good investments on commercial in order to be able to be an easier place to do business with through our commercial customers and provide better service there. And we recognize that there are opportunities on the retail side as well to improve customer service through technology. And then obviously like any mature company we're also changing our legacy systems as we move along and we've had a big effort on that over the last couple of years.",0.2007617,0.969

AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,66,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah thanks, another great question Michael. If you look at it over time we had a remarkable streak I believe of 41 straight quarters where we grew at double-digit EPS growth. A lot of things have changed since that point in time while lot of things haven't changed. We still want to grow our EBIT in the low to mid single digits and with our share repurchase program we hope to push our growth close to if not over 10%. But I don't think we'll have another streak like we had, we had 41 straight quarters. But that's within the reasons of the model. As we grow commercial we will have without a doubt pressure on our gross margins and pressure on our EBIT margins and we are not focused on what is the overall operating model -- margin for the company, we're focused on what are we going to do to grow operating profit dollars at a reasonable growth rate and get very good returns on the capital that we deployed to get that growth rate.",0.3821591,0.987
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,68,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say that the changes are really the acceleration of our commercial business and so as we've seen that grow from a mid single-digit to high single-digits to low double-digit that's a significant component of the change certainly that we've seen in the past and that's what we expect in the future. So, from that perspective and back to your margin question is that that continues to put a little bit of pressure on margin but we're all about taking market share and growing the business and growing dollars. And so that's really where our primary focus is and so far we've executed on that on both fronts but particularly in commercial.",0.6705525,0.647
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,70,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yeah, it is hard to tell a little bit on the inflation part of it. I mean there's absolutely a component of inflation that's baked into our comp store sales improvement whether or not that inflation resulted any pressure points from a demand perspective, it's hard to tell. So it's kind of two dimensional there. But look I would say that there is definitely a component of the same store sales that is somewhat driven by inflation but overall it was a healthy growth overall. And keep in mind also that our inventory return is a 1.3 so the costs are coming through at a relatively slow rate. And so we're increasing our retails as we're seeing that cost go through. So, it is a double edged sword. We wish inventory return was faster but in this particular case it's been a little bit of a benefit for us. So we've been able to kind of measurably improve our retail prices in order to offset those costs as we move along and we will continue to do that going forward. So it won't be as lumpy as increasing our retail prices all at once.",0.4668118,0.965
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,75,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",I will start with the second part of it. The weather effects in our business are generally very muted in the fall. There's not a lot of rainfall that happens in the fall generally. The temperatures are maybe warmer than last year but they're not extreme temperatures that would put excess stress on our vehicle parts. So I don't think if we called out weather as a major initiative outside of hurricanes in the past. So if we get a hurricane like we did in Houston or in South Florida then that can be a bigger issue. And what was the first part of your question Chris.,0.4536239,0.039
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,77,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it had a big effect on our commercial business. As we went into and you were asking is there something coming headwind or tailwind, as we went into the fourth quarter the real question for us was how could we lap the accelerated growth that we had last year in Q4. That's really when our growth started to begin to grow or build and we will have the same impact in Q1, Q2, and Q3 where we will be up against stronger and stronger comps. But our momentum has been pretty consistent.",0.0902179,0.912
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,79,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll go back to one thing that I said earlier in the call and that is that the effects of weather in the commercial business are very small in comparison to the retail business. So I don't want you to think that May and June were very soft because they weren't in the commercial business, they were softer in the retail business but the commercial business has been strong every period of 2019. And what's in front of us we don't know. We don't give guidance but we feel very good about the level of execution that we have, we feel very good about the initiatives that we have in place. So far they worked really well.",0.1059301,0.955

Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology",You know Bret to give you an honest answer I don't know the answer to that as far as I don't think it's significant necessarily. It certainly hasn't been something that we've talked about a lot. We have spent a lot of time here so I don't think it's a material number to us.,1.1479869,0.778
AZO-2019-Q4-2019-09-24,86,Answer,2019-09-24,4,2019,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","As we've talked about this in the last several quarters maybe year or so I think at some point in time we're trying to maintain that number at around that level. And so as we make investments in inventory and you heard Bill talk about it on hubs and mega hubs that we continue to open and that really helps drive a little bit of our overall inventory balance. But it does get inventory closer to the customer and it benefits both the retail and the commercial side of the business. So that's what puts pressure a little bit on the inventory and you've seen our inventory return go down slightly over time from 1.5, 1.4, 1.3 . And so our goal is really to kind of maintain that accounts payable to inventory balance at around that level. And we'll be able to -- may be able to improve it slightly but our objective is really to maintain it around that level.",0.5696409,0.502

I know you have made a lot of changes to the commercial business over the last few years especially on the product availability side. I also know you got your store managers much more involved really over the last year in trying to cultivate some of those relationships. So operationally can you help us understand specifically how the store managers have become more involved on the commercial front and is that something that starts to slow now that you're kind of reaching the anniversary point of that or do you think you can maintain that double-digit growth rate in commercial because that's something that builds over time? Thanks.",0.4834711,0.828

We believe that our store managers and our district managers are much more involved in the commercial business today than ever before. We started with our store managers beginning to make sales calls in the fourth quarter of last year and they're out making sales calls. But the real thing that they're doing is they're learning from the customer what's important to them and they're learning how we are executing it. When they get back to the store with their teams they can do what they do like nobody else. They can enhance our service for our customers. Before because they didn't have a direct connection to those commercial customers they really didn't know where our service advantages were and they didn't know where our service shortcomings were coming from. Now they have direct line of sight to that. I think we had a significant benefit out of that last year. I think we will continue to benefit from that for the next few years as some of them got very quickly -- got up to speed very quickly, others not so quickly.

It is the first time we've done it so we don't have empirical evidence that said that it has a three tail on it.

As we completed the first two-thirds of our quarter, our same-store sales were positive but certainly below our plan and expectations. As you will recall, in the prior year, the winter weather was also mild until the last two weeks of our quarter, when the polar vortex arrived.

But, what really matters to us in the winter time is when we get extreme cold for an extended period of time, three, four, five days. That puts a lot of pressure on failure parts.

And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that a lot of times everybody wants to compare to what's happened in the last three or four mild winters, and that's absolutely right, and we're doing the same thing. But there are other things that are happening in the environment. One of the things that's happened in some of the previous mild winters is we had a significant amount of our maintenance businesses that were pulled forward into Q2. You found not only was it not extreme cold temperatures but you had some very nice weekend weather and people did DIY jobs. We did not see that in Q2. So we are anticipating as these tax refunds flow, as the weather improves that we should have more robust maintenance performance.",0.3157628,0.922
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,82,Question,2020-03-03,2,2020,Simeon Gutman,Morgan Stanley,Great. My follow-up is on the commercial strategy. You've had great momentum. Can you talk about beginning that the megahub strategy is in and then any incremental inventory investments you plan to make this year?,0.0232058,0.848
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,83,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we've now opened 39 megahubs. We've stated externally that we want to get to 70 to 90. We are very aggressively pursuing those at this point in time, very pleased with the continued performance of our megahubs, and think that they are a key contributor to commercial. They are also a contributor to retail, but very pleased with that progress.",1.6203751,0.857
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,84,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. And I would say, we're probably in the fourth or fifth inning, I would say, on the megahubs and we'll continue to roll out on the hub strategies as well. And to Bill's point, we've been very pleased with the performance of both, the megahubs and the hubs, but in particular the megahubs both on DIY and on the commercial side of the business. Now, at the same time, that does create a little bit more inventory in the system as we get more inventory out closer to the customer, but we believe long-term that's the winning strategy.",0.3008705,0.894
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,87,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I would say, no. I think that if we look back over the quarter and see our performance, some of that impacted by weather certainly geographically as we talked about on the DIY business with similar on the commercial side of the business as well. So, some of those more cold weather geographies underperformed considerably during the quarter. So, we believe fairly confidently that we'll get back to a more normalized double-digit growth rate as we head into Q3. So, fundamentally, we don't believe that we see anything different in the business.",0.445593,0.806
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,88,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think adding a little bit of that too. We also -- and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, our up and down the street business continues to perform very, very well. We did see more challenges with our more national account business as many of which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest. So, we're encouraged by that as well.",0.0963001,0.863
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,90,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. I think, first of all, I think the organization did a great job of managing the way through a difficult quarter, being able to control SG&A leverage, gross margin and be able to drive EBIT growth of around 2%. And I believe last quarter, we said that we would expect to grow EBIT on a positive basis. And yes, we do expect to get to that low-single-digit, mid-single-digit kind of growth rate on a long-term basis.",0.4189336,0.914
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,93,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Bret. Great question. I should have clarified that in the prepared remarks. We don't have good visibility to market share gains and commercial. So, generally, we're growing commercial at 8% and the market has grown by 4%. We're pretty confident we're gaining share. My specific comments about growing share slightly are come up from a few different indications that we have on the DIY side of the business.",0.0567663,0.983
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,95,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I can't speak for theirs. We have certainly seen SKU-over-SKU year-over-year inflation. And the bigger change isn't that we've seen major inflation, it's generally that we've seen deflation. As you think about it, our parts come into the life cycle and they're very short run until the costs are more expensive. As the part become -- goes through the bell curve and becomes much more -- much higher volumes, our costs go down. And therefore, we have significant deflation as is shown in our LIFO -- major LIFO reserve that we've had forever.",0.0359858,0.71
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,96,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the last 18 months or so, we have seen some inflation. We have been very careful about managing that inflation. And as we said in our prepared remarks, if we had a 25% tariff, we didn't go out and raise our price 25%. We went out and worked that in, in tranches so that we didn't shock the customer. Over time, we think we've done a pretty good job of rolling those price increases in. We've also worked with several of our partners on not pushing the full amount to the customer. There has been some changes in the RMB currency, and we've taken advantage of that.",0.0618348,0.807
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,97,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we've been very, I think, judicious about it. We don't think we saw a big net benefit as costs go up. There is some tampering down of demand. We don't think we saw a major significant net benefit and therefore we don't think we'll see a major significant net deficit.",0.4906234,0.66
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,100,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. As Bill said, we'll have to wait and see to see how the performance is at the end of each of those quarters. Our anticipation is, this is likely more back-end loaded in the second half of the year.",0.1528836,0.477
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,102,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","That one was pretty much the savings within the supply chain and distribution on a year-over-year basis. We are continuing to try to lower our acquisition costs and believe that overall our margin remains relatively healthy. But for this specific quarter, we were able to leverage down supply chain just by lowering some costs during the quarter.",0.5952122,0.402
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,104,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","I think, some of the tariff costs are going to continue to work their way through the average cost of the inventory. And as Bill said, I think, the merchandising organization has done a nice job of being able to feather in the increases to commensurate with the cost increases that we are experiencing. And our expectation is that we will continue to do that. It may be some pressure going forward, but our expectation is that we will be able to manage our way through that.",0.3759521,0.077
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,110,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. Just to kind of go backwards first, we're in that process, I think Bill called it out in the prepared remarks that we've gone through and made applications for some rebates relative to tariffs and we've had some success, but we have more things in the work. So we'll see how it is. We don't think it'll be material, by the way. But we think it will be certainly a help overall. I think on the inflation side of it, as we said, we will probably have inflation of 2-plus-percent on a year-over-year basis from a SKU to SKU basis. But at the same time, it's very difficult to measure out what the demand impact is as some of the prices have raised a little bit. So, I think that's where we would say that we haven't seen a material impact overall from the inflation relative to comp store sales, because it is kind of a blended number with the demand as well.",0.3656148,0.803
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,112,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William T. Giles,"CFO, EVP-Finance & Information Technology","Yes. From a CapEx perspective, I think our expectation is around $600 million of CapEx for the year and I believe depreciation is around that $350 million number. I would say overall from a CapEx investment perspective, obviously, first and foremost, we're investing in our stores, we're investing in the maintenance of our stores, continue to ensure that they look great. We're investing in hubs and megahubs along the way. We also have a good -- a sizable investment in technology as well. We continue to invest in technology, both to enhance our existing systems as well as to add new functionality in order to improve our customer experience both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business as well. So, those are the major projects that we kind of continue to work on.",0.0767138,0.963

But, if you're talking about are we changing the way we go to market in our supply chain by implementing a tremendous amount of new automation or those kind of things, at this point, we're not. We're constantly looking at the calculations of where the IRRs make sense. As wage pressure goes up, it changes the economics and we'll continue to look at it, but we don't have anything to talk about significantly currently.",0.2417638,-0.153

As you would expect, over the last month or so, we have been very-focused on the supply chain aspects of coronavirus. And in the last week or two, more and more focused on what's happening here in the United States and ultimately, Mexico and Brazil. We see no indications at this point in time of any demand destruction as a result of coronavirus. But just like we said with the supply chain, it's an incredibly, incredibly fluid situation. I think, the next couple of weeks to a month are going to be critical to see what actually happens. We don't have good insights into that.",0.3527623,0.686
AZO-2020-Q2-2020-03-03,119,Answer,2020-03-03,2,2020,William C. Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a lot packed into that question. Yes, we haven't been big on talking about the ramifications of the car park over the last 12 years. We all know that there was a significant divot in new car sales in 2009. And as those cars came into the ""sweet spot', there was a headwind for a while and now it looks like it's turned into a tailwind. I think it's on the margin in both instances. What we like to see is steady state new vehicles coming on the road, $16 million, $17 million. The scrappage rate doesn't appear to change much at all. And therefore, we just have a steady state of new cars. I don't think there's anything in the next two or three or four years, that's going to be radically different than what we've seen in the past.",0.1044095,0.889

I think what gives us the confidence is that we've been here before. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, most of our management team has been here for decades. We've seen times of strength; we've seen times of softness. We certainly saw softness in the second quarter. As we're looking at the second half of the year, we have concerns and we also have things that we're very positive about.",0.8388241,0.946

Rhodes,"Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the concern side, I mentioned earlier that the roads, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast haven't had the kind of difficult conditions that put stress on brake systems and under car systems. That's likely to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the second half of the year.",0.514445,-0.68
