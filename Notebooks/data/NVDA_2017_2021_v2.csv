We had record GAAP gross margin of 57.9%, while non-GAAP gross margin was 58.1%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, down 9% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, up 6% from a year earlier. This reflects increased hiring in R&D and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees. GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $317 million, compared to $76 million a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $382 million, up 65%.

NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,21,Question,2016-08-11,2,2017,Mark Lipacis,Prudential,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the datacenter business. Can you help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications, versus the classic computationally intense design applications?",,0.66
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,22,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Mark. Our datacenter business is comprised of three basic markets, as you're alluding to; one is high-performance computing, and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market, and very computationally intensive. Our second market is GRID, which is our datacenter virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from datacenter to any client device. And the third application is deep learning, and this is largely our hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter, much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far, and the reason for that is because high-performance computing is a relatively stable business, it's still growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. GRID is a fast-growing business. I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year over-year, but it's from a much smaller base. And deep learning is not only significant in size, it's also growing quite substantially.",1.0189459,0.846
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,23,Question,2016-08-11,2,2017,Mark Lipacis,Prudential,"That's very helpful. Thank you. And then last question. On the new - so you're just starting to ship Pascal now, and I guess my understanding is that, historically, as you're shipping the new product, the yields have opportunity for improvement and the more volume is shipped, the more you climb down the yield curve. What classically happens here on the yield, and does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters? Thank you.",,0.929
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,24,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we've talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years. For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us. And then with all of these challenges it's an opportunity for us to improve our company, and we've implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology, and it starts, of course, with some of the world's best process design engineers, circuit design engineers and process readiness teams. And we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us.",0.6517396,0.968
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,25,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the second part of it is just how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company. And so I'm really proud of the way that the company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer FinFET is no trivial task, not to mention the speed of the memories that we used. It's the world's first G5X. We also ramped the world's first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking. So the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary. I'm super proud of the team. Now, going forward, we're going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness, and so it's too early to guess what's going to happen to yields and margins long term, but we'll guide one quarter at a time.",0.9125043,0.843

Your Q3 revenue guide implies further acceleration on a year-over-year basis. Are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth, or should we expect growth in the quarter to be broad-based?",,0.929
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,28,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Toshiya. I appreciate it. We're experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming and virtual reality, these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference, is really paying off. And I think this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses. And my expectation is that we're going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well. But it's driven by the focus on these key markets, and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think the one particular dynamic sticks out, and it's a very significant growth driver of where we have an extraordinary position in, and it's deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard, is a new computing approach. It's a new computing model, and requires a new computing architecture. And this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited.",0.74268,0.976
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,29,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And five years ago, we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially. And we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology, from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into; for example NVLink to other system software that has been designed for it, like cuDNN and DIGITS, to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company. The last five years, we've quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all in. And now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably - if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance, it would be deep learning.",0.3024457,0.936

NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,31,Question,2016-08-11,2,2017,Vivek Arya,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming; very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal, and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now, and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles.",0.4545455,0.95
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,32,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's say, on PC gaming there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about a third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much - and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high-performance; it's also energy-efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us.",0.6331381,0.948
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,33,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I'd mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. I mean, this is a dynamic that's relatively new.",0.6448502,0.88
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,34,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. That's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher. And I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well, as you know very well, which is, eSports is no longer just an interest, eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course the Western world as well.",0.1067861,0.982
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,35,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some right content now, but some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots, but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium, we introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world's first in-game photography system. It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your videogame, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high-res with all your friends.",0.2380296,0.984

And so I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal; very, very small of course because we just started production ramp, but even then only a third has upgraded to Maxwell, And so there's it's a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us.",0.4946607,0.967

Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the datacenter competitive landscape, early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning, AI, and also kind of how your products are positioned from a high-end or low-end type of machine learning application performance.",,0.772
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,39,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks. Well, as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry. We've been in this industry since the very beginning, and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors.",0.8191526,0.754

That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match.",0.4257664,0.947
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,41,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large-scale and it's completely global. And this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant long-term. And so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip, it's GPU architecture, it's the GPU's design, it's the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world.",0.5728557,0.947
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,42,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations. When we started this we were in Kepler. Maxwell was some 10 times better than Kepler, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell. And so in just two generations, just five years time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And a GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. Now our strategy, and this is where we're different, not only to focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture.

Yeah, we've just started this quarter shipping DRIVE PX 2. And just before I answer your question, let me tell you what DRIVE PX 2 is. DRIVE PX 2, of course, is a processor. It's the DRIVE PX 2 version with just one single processor, with just Parker, and our Tegra processor, and optionally with discrete GPUs, you could literally build - you can build a car with autopilot capability, or an AI co-pilot capability, all the way to self-driving car capability. And it is able to do sensor fusion. It's able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping, detection using deep neural nets of the environment in a surround matter, all of the cameras around the car all feeding into the processor, and the DRIVE PX processor doing real-time inferencing of surround cameras, all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car, all done in this one car computer, this one car AI supercomputer.

Founders Edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA, and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. Now, there are some people that - some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company. Its availability is limited, and it's engineered just at the highest possible level of quality. And we limit the production of it.

The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be, and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the datacenter? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective. But is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing? Thank you.",0.2484076,0.937
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,54,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Yeah. First of all, the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text, it's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through datacenters today, as you guys know very well, are images, there are voice, there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server, and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter that's running real time on their live video, so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert, and who to invite to come and watch the live video.",0.3982087,0.968
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,55,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture, it's a new computing model, it recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really, well, a good fit.",0.5418533,0.886
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,56,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so now the question is, how much. It's hard to say, it's hard to say how much, but my sense is that it's going to be a lot, and without any predictions it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale datacenter will be GPU accelerated. They will be GPU accelerated for training, they will be GPU accelerated for inferencing, there may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that.",0.3627282,0.867
NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,57,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then lastly, APUs. I guess for datacenters, I guess my sense is for datacenters, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI, and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is GPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close, there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of, and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny. And for most datacenters, I think if you have CPU workloads anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion, anyways.",0.4085429,0.883

We have to continue to keep pushing VR, and get the head mounts out to the world. I think HTC Vive, they're doing a great job, Oculus of course are doing a great job. And so I think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there, and it's growing all the time. Second, the content is really cool, and people are really enjoying it, and so we just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR. It really is a great new experience. But it's not just games as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and in industrial design, in medicines, medical imaging, in architectural engineering. We use it ourselves. We're doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs, and then we render it into VR, and we enjoy it completely in VR.",0.3723734,0.988

So architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. Now, one of the things that we did, which was really spectacular, is the multi-resolution, multi-projection rendering of Pascal. It's the world's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one. And the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard, you have one display. But that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types. And so multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and Pascal introduced it and you really benefit it in VR.",0.6197038,0.949

The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can't feel anything. Things don't collide, things don't bounce. When you pick up something, you don't feel the haptics of it. We have made the entire environment physically simulated, and so as a result, you feel the entire environment. When you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over, and balls behave the way balls behave, and things don't merge into each other. So that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize VR, we believe, and that physics simulation is another thing.

And going forward, which is part of your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for Internet service providers for voice recognition, and image recognition, and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data.

And the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through, to sort through, and now with deep learning they can discover really, really subtle insights in data that's hyper-dimensional. And so the way to think about deep learning is really mathematics. It's a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful. It's a new approach to software, but don't think of it as a market.

The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building, or just a consumer product, or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations.",0.3482604,0.813

And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPU use has really, really increased, and it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they've put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there.",0.1853255,0.936

Well, we play in a graceful, friendly and open way, and I mean that, I guess, rather seriously. We believe this, we believe that building a autonomous driving car, a self driving car is a pile of software, and it's really complicated software. It's really, really complicated software. And it's not like one company is going to do it. And it's also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We've always felt that self-driving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny.

The DRIVE PX 2 architecture is scalable, and the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on an highway, and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geofenced autonomous shuttle, a completely autonomous taxi, all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip. It's just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. And the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more nines you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four years or five years has increased by a 100 times, but notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become.

And that's what deep learning - that's the - I've called it, it's Thor's hammer that fell from the sky, and it's amazing technology that these researchers discovered. And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared because GPUs is naturally parallel, and we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. But when you think about it in the context that it's just - it's software development, it's a new method of doing software and it's a new way of discovering insight from data.

NVDA-2017-Q2-2016-08-12,86,Answer,2016-08-11,2,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So every life sciences company needs it, every healthcare company needs it, every energy discovery company needs it, every e-tail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data, everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it, every company that cares about security, every company that deals with the massive amount of customer data has the benefit of - can benefit from deep learning. So when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learning's market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer Internet services. And that's exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DGX-1 because most of these enterprises don't have the expertise, or simply don't have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or high-performance computer. They would just rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box. And that's essentially what NVIDIA DGX-1 is. It's a supercomputer in a box, and it's designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning.",0.5887013,0.961

But I'm curious to see how that kind of compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing, I guess, different solutions for different levels of the ADAS systems, whether it's level 1, level 2, level 3, specifically with the V2X communication where for level 4 autonomous driving you're going to need six to 20 different radar units, three to six different cameras, LiDAR.

There's no way to square and there's no reason to square, and you're not going to find one answer. And the reason why you're not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done.

Some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks. So you see a lot of different visions out there. And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things, and they're targeting different aspects of transportation. I think there's a fallacy that transportation in every single country, in every single form is exactly the same. It just doesn't work that way. And so there's technology insight and then there's market insight, and there's a technology vision versus your entry point. And I think that's where all of the squaring doesn't happen.

We are absolutely certain that AI is going to be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles, and to solve these puzzles over the period of time; number one. Number two, we believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability.

In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we're in is power-constrained; every single environment.

First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year, is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you'd expected given the shortage or is it more just about unit volume. And then, just following up on that. What's your level of confidence and that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?",,0.772
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,108,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Q2, we were -- we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It's improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so, the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly and that's affected our initial ramp. We don't expect it to affect our ramp going forward.",0.269721,-0.599
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,109,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU which is super energy efficient, in combination made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799 thin and really delightful all the way up to something incredible with a RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use.",0.2600758,0.985
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,110,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had -- I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some hundred notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so, I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It's the fastest growing segment. It is very largely under penetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn't really possible to design a notebook that is both great and performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own.",0.2469859,0.948
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,111,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so finally, we've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and create a powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that's really wonderful to own and carry around. And so, this is going to be a really -- this is a fast-growing segment and all the OEMs know it and that's why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes and we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks gaming PCs ramping right now.",0.3517051,0.895
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,112,Question,2019-05-16,1,2020,Chris Caso,FBR Capital Markets,"It's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. We've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility and I guess the question is, when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue is next year the year. And then, what would be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution. I presume some at level two plus things you've been talking about would probably most likely there given the amount of volume there, if you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers?",,0.733
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,113,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Level 2+ call it 2020, late 2021 or 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019 very, very early for robot taxis, next year substantially more volume for robot taxis 2021 bigger volumes for robot taxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robot taxi because of sensor resolution's, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm all of it put together it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation and so the economics would reflect that.",0.3585946,0.71
NVDA-2020-Q1-2019-05-16,114,Answer,2019-05-16,1,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so that robot taxi is kind of like next year, year after ramp and then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022. Overall, remember that our economics come from four different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it. There's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation, and then the economics of the car. And so, we just announced Constellation, the enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation.",0.0034447,0.951

I guess Jen-Hsun you've done, you said in many forums that move down to the new process noted 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach and I agree with that. But, maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around 7-nanometer franchising in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program?

Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was. And it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was.

And so we're off to a great start in Turing and I'm super excited about that. And then, in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom, our Turing architecture spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like.

If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists and it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our current GPUs. And so that the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those two things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.",0.0437478,0.905

We're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with the year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in a high single digit. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there. But our year-over-year growth start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this past year.

Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, two dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on the heels of CONTROL, an action adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week's PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement.

Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google's breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past.

Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette.",0.1163278,0.818

As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors. The -- as you know, we've been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn't really take that much of the data center capacity.",0.3858078,0.896
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,31,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Over the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you're watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections, all of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you're going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning.",0.0692387,0.807
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,32,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time.",0.2793662,0.361
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,33,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we're seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and they're getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers.",0.1718911,0.862
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,34,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there's a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor, there's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don't have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot.",0.0354805,0.178
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,35,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn't own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can't afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA's full stack of every single model. And it's managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can't afford to go out there to manage them. And we've seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service.",0.0192904,0.952
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,36,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it's nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there's like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1/3 of the world's land mass. And so there's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX.",0.3892525,0.939
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,37,Question,2019-11-14,3,2020,Vivek Arya,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you're probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October -- into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out?",0.1258971,0.769
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,38,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. During Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we're seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it's so important. I would say that at this point, I think it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them.",0.113331,0.943

Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I'm excited about that.",0.0974854,0.885

In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time.

As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA's really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU -- having the world's best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it's in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can't just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we're a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers.

And the foundation of that is AI, it's deep learning inference. That is -- this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train.",0.4161213,0.849

Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why -- although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated -- we submitted all 5 results -- all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it's really quite a great challenge. And it's one of the great computer science challenges.

These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously.

The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They're very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I've talked about this before, but I've never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only -- the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the -- our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global.

And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups.

You can manage it from afar. It's -- the stack is complicated. It's performant. And we saw some -- we've been working with some early adopters.

The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you're calling it out in Q4 and you didn't call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4?",,0.978
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,69,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.",0.4921077,0.949

Now -- and that's after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me -- I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise.

NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,73,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.",0.6262767,0.875

NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,76,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now -- we have now sold more -- this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that's used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They're at record levels. And T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago, now it's selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs.

NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,78,Question,2019-11-14,3,2020,Joseph Moore,,I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there -- how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU?,0.6619594,0.487
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,79,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it's really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that's necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it's a VM environment like VMware. And we -- recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner -- we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they're seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we're going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes.",0.3155357,0.888
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,80,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so our strategy is to -- our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we're going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we've done for creating a -- excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center.",0.2803996,0.921
NVDA-2020-Q3-2019-11-14,81,Answer,2019-11-14,3,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can't do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center's computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they're geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that's really -- this is really the future that we're going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT -- AI and IoT applications",0.3062349,0.983

The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it's a IKEA Catalog or movie, or architectural engineering, or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray-tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated, has been computing intensive for very long time.

Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So, I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don't forget, our work in terms of Datacenter and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer in some cases in terms of what we have also in terms of there.

In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of year. But, at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so, that makes comparisons on a sequential basis -- on a I guess, quarterly sequential basis harder. But, on a year-to-year basis, I think we're doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing, high-performance computing of course, Datacenters is growing. AI, the adoption continues to seep from one industry to another industry. The automation that's going to be brought about by AI, is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody has ever seen before.

The first of course is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms in order to make a recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, which customer, is a really large computing problem.

And that's just for developing the model. The next stage is to simulate the entire software because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year.

All of those tools and libraries run on top of Voltaand run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal. What Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Corethat is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large scale training. Eight GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories.

And so, do they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it's kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped on to the market to buy it from retail, and that probably happened a great deal as well.

And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning, and now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from internet services all over the world. And so, now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it. We are actively working with just about every single internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack.

I think, that if you look at the -- if you start from first principles, here's the simple way to look at it. Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every five years. 10x every five years is approximately Moore's Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every five years. However, Moore's Law stopped. And so, that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way.

And my expectation is that more and more from one vertical industry after another, and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned healthcare, the vertical industries go on and on, that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every five years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA's GPU computing to boost their demand.

And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So, we're in the process of finishing HGX-2 and ramping into production. And so, I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned.

As the quarter progressed and the stores reopened, retail demand picked up, iCafes largely reopened and online sales continued to thrive. Gaming laptop demand is very strong as students and professionals turn to GeForce-based systems to improve how they work, learn, and game from home. We ramped over 100 new models with our OEM partners focused on both premium and mainstream price points. In the premium laptop segment, we delivered unparalleled performance with the GeForce RTX 2080 and the 2070 SUPER GPUs [indiscernible] form factors. We also brought ray tracing to gaming laptops for the first time at price points as low as $999 with the GeForce RTX 2060.

NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,24,Question,2020-08-19,2,2021,Vivek Arya,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch,"Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Jensen, I am wondering how much of the strength that you are seeing in gaming and data center is maybe more temporary because of COVID or some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into hopefully sooner rather than later into a more normalized period for the industry?",0.798445,0.958
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,25,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn't see pull-ins and we are in the beginning of our brand new product cycle with Ampere and so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, with all that's happening around the world and it's really unfortunate but it's made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time - spending their time in videogames. The thing that people haven't realized about videogames is that it's not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you are spending time with your friends, you are using it to create to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people. And so - and then of course, it's just an incredibly fun way to spend time even by consumption of the video - of a videogame. And so there is just so much that you could do with videogames now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don't think it's going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. And PC is now the single largest entertainment platform - is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it's not just about gaming. There's just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. With data center the things that - the structural change that's happening in data center are coupled with different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud, the way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it's really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It's a type of software that really wants acceleration. And NVIDIA's GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it. And then the last reason about the data center is the - this architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that's driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. And so, because of this type of architecture, two components, two types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was - is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into this - in a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run. That transition is called east-west traffic. And the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that's what Mellanox is fantastic at. And so, we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that's why - that's the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven. And that's the benefit of our GPUs. And then, lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that's where Mellanox comes in. And so, I think that this is - the dynamics that I am describing are permanent, and it's just been accelerated to the present, because of everything that's happening to us. But this is the future, and it's not - there's no going back. It's - and we just found everything accelerated.",1.0754392,0.999

NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,27,Question,2020-08-19,2,2021,Timothy Arcuri,Citigroup,"Thanks a lot. Jensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you have been radical on that for some time. And when you have been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly picking that approach. So, I guess, the question is why do you think you won't have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this, talk about you and ARM. So, I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU? Thanks.",,0.877
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,28,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system. But we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining it to Vivek just now that a microservice that we are enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. And so, the data center is running - the entire data center is running an application. I mean, that's pretty remarkable thing. And that happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that, as a computing company, we have to be a data center scale company and we architect from that starting. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink, with eight processors being fully synchronized across the computing node, and we created the DGX. We recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that's why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it's GPUDirect or, recently, the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all in one holistic way. And then in the last - in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world's first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world's first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be one GPU or, with NVlink, 8 GPUs combined, working together. So you could think of them as being titled, so those 8 GPUs are working harmoniously together or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don't need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so, whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes, create a larger GPU using NVLink, or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you would like. You made a comment about - you asked a question about ARM. We have been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it's autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we are in. And then, recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so, we worked with the ARM team very closely. They are really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it's incredibly energy-efficient. And because it's energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so, anyways, we love working with the ARM guys.",0.7347571,0.991

NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,31,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are - we are still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we are in, is the world's first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses - the RTX technology fuses three fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics, and we added two new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene - objects in scene super, super fast. And that's - it's a complicated problem. It's a super complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that's really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it's also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that's called RTX. And Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we are in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they are going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.",1.1036858,0.997

Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center.

Right now, A100 probably represents less than a quarter of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy.

I would love to hear if there's any particular platforms over the last 3 months where you have made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever. Thank you.",,0.97
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,36,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks so much, C.J. We are expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now, they are hanging out with friends. They are using it to create other content. They are using, game captures, create art. They are sharing it with the community. It's a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described, require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems and - but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so, the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. And the second thing is that RTX, it's a home run. We really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it's really, really the next level. It's not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so, for the last 15 years, we have been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there's never been a giant leap like this. And RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. And then the third factor is the console launch. There's - people are really - the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And because of the gaming - because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home, I think it's going to be the most amazing season ever. We are already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has - about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom. I mean - which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean, they are on their way to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so, I am super excited for them. And so, I think it's going to be quite a huge second half of the year.",0.8074406,0.999

Jensen, just following-up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next call it, 6 to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess the breadth that you have built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months? And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins, you are guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what's driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter? Thank you.",,0.932
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,45,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thank you. So and thanks for the question. The - our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence in all the services are - that are in - by the cloud service providers. And I think it's fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we are seeing anywhere from 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so, in the last three years, we have seen somewhere between 1,000x to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. And so, the.1 trend that we are - we are probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the - and I remember C.J.'s question now, and I'll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how - what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand. And there are three big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding. The ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it's called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos and there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to - that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous. And so, the first one is natural language understanding, the second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean, we are going to have conversational engines that are just super clever. And they can predict what you're about to ask. They're going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the three pillars that I just described. And I haven't even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate. And breakthroughs that we're seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so, the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we're indexed to AI. The second, we're indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. And then the third thing that we're indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I have just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. NVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal. And these three facts that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based, and scale-up-based. And so, these - bare-metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it's one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they are at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they are at the intersection of all of that. And I just described three dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we're really indexed to. And then lastly, when somebody adopts - when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we are in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It's the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it's - it reduced - it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so, we're in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we've ever had. And so, we are going to keep on racing through the second half.",0.6503617,0.998
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,46,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Okay. And, Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix, but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So, keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter over quarter for our overall console shipments. We are going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too.",0.3463324,0.867

So, in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what's driving the trajectory? Are you more demand- or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you'd have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now?",,0.875

Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we're seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we are very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that's how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it's not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100, T4. And we are also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So, I hope that helps you understand our statements on where we are at in terms of the Q3 guidance.

But you guys haven't really felt the need to be first on seven-nanometer, and you have done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA?",0.0564872,0.936
NVDA-2021-Q2-2020-08-19,55,Answer,2020-08-19,2,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, alright? And so, process technology we have a really awesome process engineering team. World-class. Everybody will recognize that it's absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that is ideal for us. It's a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. Then the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We are paid for architecture. And there's a vast difference between our architecture and the second-best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the - in the transistor side. And so, it must be more complicated than that. And so, we put a lot of energy into that. And then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it's really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you're a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what's underneath it, nor do you care. And so, what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are lot of code in there. And so, what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world's best processors, and we use the world's best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world's best packaging. We're the world's first user of cobots. And whether it's - I think we are",0.6799862,0.994

Our Ampere Architecture, as it relates to gaming, as well as what it relates to data center. As we articulated in our call we have been really seeing continued uplift of folks adoption of A100 and it's going quite smoothly than what we had seen in prior overall versions.

I had a question on crypto, I guess Jensen, I know that the CMP stuff and the software drivers stuff that you're doing for the 36.

And so I think proof of work is going to be around for a bit. We developed CMP for this very reason, just so that there are different versions. We have different versions of our products for gaming, for professional visualization, for high performance computing, for deep learning. It stands to reasoning that you have to do a different version for CMP and we can solve it directly the way that we go-to-market would be to go directly to the industrial miners to - and it's a great benefit to them. So they don't have to chasing around spot markets. It's a great benefit to the gamers. And because they want a game, and the game demand is just probably is off a chart. And so this is visibility really beneficial to everybody. The recent hash rate growth was really a result of several dynamics. The first dynamic is the install base. Most people thought that the - once the mining - the GPUs come back into the aftermarket, a small part does that, some people do that, but the vast majority don't keep them. And the reason for that is because obviously they believe in Ethereum and so - they're industrial miners that's what they do. And so, they're keeping around for when the profitability returns and they could kick start the mining gear. We saw - that's what we saw in the latter part of last year. We saw the hash rates starting to grow.",1.9962108,0.315

It wasn't until earlier this year that we started to see a demand in our own GPUs. And when that starts to happen, there are some different dynamics. There's - the primary source these days come from powerful ASICs. And then there's some that that comes from our GPU and other GPUs in the marketplace. And so, I think that this is going to be a part of our business. It won't grow extremely large, no matter what happens. And the reason for that is because when it starts to grow large more ASICs comes into market, which kind of needs it.

Now, one of the important things is to realize that in the near-term, the - because we're in the beginning parts of our Ampere ramp, only two quarters into a multi-year cycle. This is also the first time that we've completely changed computer graphics. RTX using ray tracing is completely different than virtualization. And so this is a fundamental change in the way we do computer graphics and the results have been spectacular. There are some 200 million install base in desktops and 50 million in laptop.

I want to go back to data center. You've been very kind over the last couple of quarters to call out Mellanox both when it was a positive driver and when it was a headwind. I'm kind of curious as you do - when you look into the fiscal first quarter, is there anything of distinction to mention around Mellanox versus core data center?

And some of that is just simple math where you're just comping very hard compares from last year. But Jensen how would you think about data center year-over-year growth in the context of a reopening trade or any sort of new applications out there?

Every single application in the data center and every single node in the data center has to be individually secured, zero trust computing, zero or confidential computing or zero trust computing. These initiatives are going to cause every data center to have every single application and every single node would be secured, which means every one of those computers have to have a control plane that is isolated from the application plane.

As you know we lowered fourth quarter guidance for January 28th and the results are in line with our pre-announcement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from the previous year.",1.1597029,0.34
NVDA-2019-Q4-2019-02-14,9,Remarks,2019-02-14,4,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Starting with our gaming business revenue. Revenue of $954 million was down 45% year-on-year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full year revenue was up 13% percent to $6.25 billion. Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through. We expect channel inventory to normalize in Q1 in line with one to two quarter timeline we had outlined on our previous earnings calls.",1.1346332,-0.25
NVDA-2019-Q4-2019-02-14,10,Remarks,2019-02-14,4,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Second, deteriorating macro economic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs; and third, sales of certain high end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real time ray-tracing in AI, but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for lower price points for further demonstrations of the RTX technology and actual gains. The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model.",1.2386258,0.19
NVDA-2019-Q4-2019-02-14,11,Remarks,2019-02-14,4,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line. Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the long live business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products. To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across the period that doesn't include crypto demand.",1.1067781,0.153
NVDA-2019-Q4-2019-02-14,12,Remarks,2019-02-14,4,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Let's look at the four quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 of this year. In Q2 and Q3 of last year with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4 and will do so again in Q1. Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these four quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over these same four quarters, such in total we believe are normalized for the gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion.",0.9229341,0.178

Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming. At CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business. We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the mid range price point of $340. The 2060 delivers a 60% performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing's real time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time.

Full your revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% year-on-year. New applications like data science, AI and VR, as well as the need for thin and light mobile workstations remain key growth drivers for the business. We get key wins in the quarter, including Boeing, Google, LinkedIn and Toyota for applications including AI and robotics. This past week with our partners HP, Dell, Lenovo, we announced the availability of Quadro RTX workstation. Quadro RTX is the most significant workstation GPU upgrade in 10 years. It will enable millions of designers and creative artists for first time to work interactively with super high resolution media and photorealistic 3D rendering, enabling them to be creative with dramatically improved productivity.",1.1499536,0.976

Q4 revenue was $163 million, up 23% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. Full year revenue reached $641 million, up 15%. The sequential decline was largely seasonal. The year-on-year growth was driven by the increasingly adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals, partially offset by declines in legacy infotainment. Last month at CES, we announced DRIVE AutoPilot, the world's first commercially available level two plus self driving car computer. This system offers sophisticated automated driving features that far surpassed today's ADAS offerings, increasing the vehicles' performance, functionality and road safety, while the driver remains in control.",0.9192201,0.878

Q4 GAAP gross margins was 54.7% and non-GAAP was 56%, down sequentially and year-on-year, primarily due to $128 million charge for DRAM [port] and other components associated with our lower than expected Q4 revenue and current market conditions. GAAP operating expenses were $913 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $755 million, up 25% and 24% year-on-year respectively. The GAAP EPS was $0.92, down 48% from a year earlier. Full year GAAP EPS was $6.63, up 38% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 53% from a year ago. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $6.64, up 35% from the prior year. We returned $1.95 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. As we announced last quarter, we plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and buybacks.

I guess this question is more for Jen-Hsun. Are you concerned at all about your ability to condense and incentivize gamer stuff later as pointed out, it's more of a timing thing. And the second question is inventory was up on the balance sheet. Collette, if you can just provide some color there and expectations going forward. Thank you.",,0.25

And in addition to that, the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the over clocked versions. And the MSRP versions didn't show up for some short time after, couple of months after. And so the conditions weren't ideal, if you will. We weren't able to launch into the mainstream segment with 260 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now. And so I think that the situ wasn't ideal. When you take a look at our situation now, every single graphics card had the best performance at its price point and it remains so today.",0.2242508,0.94

It is true that everybody was hoping to see more games with RTX on day one. But it's such a new technology was ray-tracing and AI for image processing that it's only really possible to make available with new games, which is tied to the schedules of new games. And now they're starting to come out. Battlefield 5, Metro Exodus, I think that the reviews from this week are just spectacular, people are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about and that it's possible with RTX technology, the combination of applying ray-tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance to understand now the benefits of [Audio Gap] the game engines are going to incorporate RTX and ray-tracing technology and the engine itself.

Our inventory dollars at the end of Q4 rose just due to the weaker than expected finish to Q4. Inventory right now is primarily related to Turing, Volta and DGX.

Can you give a little bit more color in terms of I guess what you're seeing across enterprise cloud, high performance compute, and I guess within that, how you're seeing the ramp of T4? And I guess if you can then speak to I'm sure embedded in the fiscal '20 guidance is a pretty nice ramp into the second half.

There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we've not experienced in a while. And so I think that it has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth is, it's not certainly been satisfied with what was shipped last quarter. And so I think that the demand will return and customers will return. Our situation in data centers is dramatically better year-over-year. And if you take a look at where we are, our deep learning solution is unquestionably the best in the world. We introduced T4 with inference capability, it's the world's first universal cloud GPU and it does everything that NVIDIA does, all in one GPU and 75 watts.

And because of the partnerships that we've developed and the excitement that people see around enterprises around the world, we've developed partnerships with large IT companies to pre-configure systems that make it easier for enterprises to be able to adopt our technology.

Colette, what is the normalized run rate for gross margins? As you get to your sales back to normalized levels, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And will there be any impact from the balance sheet inventory? And then on the question Jen-Hsun, can you give us more reassurance that gaming is still a growth business? I understand that over the last year, there's been a lot of confusion, there's been macro issues. But if you look at the number of gamers and the mix of product that their banks are essentially to sell through to gamers, has that been on an upward trajectory?

Games are better than ever. There's been a recent shift in the popularity of multiplayer competitive e-sports like games, that's good for hardware. It lowers the barrier to entry, because it's free to play with the exception of downloadable content. And so the barriers to entry is lower but you could see that the excitement around Fortnight and recently with Apex Legend, PUBG is still popular, League of Legends is still popular. And so this genre of games is both competitive, requires great hardware, it attracts a lot more players, because it's social and you want to play with your friends and it's much stickier, because it happens to be social, it happens to be a game where you have to play with a whole bunch of other people.

I think last year and we had mentioned it before that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year-over-year. And just at CES the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing, because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time.

And because of the flexibility of CUDA and because the performance of architecture, over the course of last year, we reengineered the entire data analytics stack. So that we can accelerate, it's called RAPIDS. That work is really, really important and I hope to give you guys updates on that on a regular basis.

So we invested in the stack called RAPIDS and built our architecture, called T4. And we're in the process of partnering with large IT companies to take the stack and the solution out to the world's enterprise. And so, I expect enterprise to be a fairly exciting growth opportunity for us. Meanwhile, the CSPs, their pause will end. The amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning. And we have inference opportunity with the work that we do with T4 and TensorRT.

So if I look at the cloud CapEx, we are up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business, did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you go faster than overall CapEx?

As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscales and our hyperscales many of them are also cloud providers did start to slowdown in terms of their purchasing in latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate as you can see from our data center business grew more than 50% for the full year. Now even without strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CapEx that we see in the cloud providers or the overall hyperscales. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas of where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on AI, as they focus on the cloud businesses, and the importance of that compute is necessary. But we're still a very, very small percentage of it. So slowdown in the second half of the year, full year growth, phenomenal growth of 50% and we track with that for this year.",0.4939647,0.875

When we listen to players like Google and Facebook and others, they all seem to be seemed like very tuned to grow their overall spending this year. And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be -- they all demonstrate a bit of a confidence that in the second half, spending should resume.

There seems to be some concern around the near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we're hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter.",0.1556684,0.866
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,34,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we expect to continue to do well in data centers. The -- if you look at the background of what's happening, we know that Moore's Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computational and really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren't getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore's Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic.",0.7220117,0.866
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,35,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there's a lot of domain expertise, where there's -- whether it's in retail or whether it's in financial services or health care, logistics, there's a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore's Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well.",0.9734757,0.986

And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products?",0.7834179,0.96

It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It's the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it's the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world's first application to support real-time ray-tracing.

Colette, you mentioned that typically, the midrange is about 1/3 of gaming. How much was it in the October quarter? And are you effectively assuming close to 0 in the January quarter?

So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1/3 consistently over, let's say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters.

The ProVis platform, more -- there's more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it's not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it's been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change.

Is it pricing? Is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter, but it hasn't. Do you think people were waiting for Turing to come out and maybe that created some kind of pause?

NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,45,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, well, we came into Q3 with excess channel inventory post the crypto hangover. We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline and decline slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I'm hoping that -- I'm hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it's at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell anymore into the channel for the upcoming quarter to get the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has.

I mean, we're surprised by it, as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we're going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that.

This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It's never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it's still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet.

And so it played no role in its transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. It's -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we're talking about. And we really didn't see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there's a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter's time, we'll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can't exactly sure what we would have done different.

I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's Law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We're the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world.

There's nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize that it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down, started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that's what we're experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects. But there's nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that's fundamentally different.",0.7258009,0.983

To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing. In terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange, but overall, as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well.",1.1109564,0.929

NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,79,Question,2018-11-15,3,2018,Christopher Caso,,A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. And perhaps I don't know if it's a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude for how the ramp goes?,,0.0
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,80,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or the models on top of T4. And so we're working hard on that.",0.8784017,0.968

I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned.

It's inference at the edge, right?",,0.794
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,84,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is a functional save, high-performance with a lot of complicated software, one version of that, you could say, is self-driving cars. And this quarter, we announced winning our first mass-market Level 2. We've been really successful in robot taxis and Level 4s and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems, where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of LiDARs and surround cameras requires a lot of computation and -- but we've never been successful until now. We're taking the DRIVE platform all the way down to Level 2 mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I'm expecting many more. And I think we've positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver Level 2 capability in a single chip for the very first time. And Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip, autonomous vehicle processor in production today. Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots. It could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, and autonomous warehouses. So -- or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that, in the device itself, recognizes and identifies anomalies. And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI, and that's the reason why we built Jetson.",0.4181881,0.988

The clarification is just on the inventory issue, and thanks for all the color. But one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s and then Ti flavors still selling? And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? And then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year.",,0.986
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,87,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it's one of the best quarter we've ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers' hands all over the world. The area where I'm super excited about right now are the three that I've mentioned that we've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of",0.9490183,0.975
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,88,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore's Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let's call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic.",0.7085773,0.965
NVDA-2018-Q3-2018-11-16,89,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so that's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple -- 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us. The answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity.

Just Colette, going back to your commentary around Mellanox, it seems like you're guiding the January quarter to about $500 million, which means the core data center business is still growing nicely, call it, 6%, 7% sequentially. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at the core data center business, I know there's not a direct correlation to server business. But, we're clearly going through a cloud digestion in server and core vertical markets, enterprise, the servers are weak. When you look at your core data center business, do you feel as though that's having an impact, and this is sort of the digestion that you saw kind of in late fiscal '20 -- sorry, fiscal '19 into '20, but you're doing it still growing significantly year-over-year, or how would you characterize the macro backdrop?",1.1200488,0.866

The only thing I would add is that our inference initiative is really gaining great momentum. Inference is one of the hardest computer science problems. Compiling these gigantic neural network computational graphs into a target device really, really -- has proven to be really, really hard. The models are diverse when you count vision to language to speech. And there are so many different types of models being created that model sizes are doubling every couple of months. The latency expectations are increasing all the time, -- or latency is decreasing all the time. And so, the pressure on inference is really great. The technology pressure is really great.

I mean, it's very clear that the inability to go to work is slowing down the adoption of new technology in some of the verticals. Of course, we're seeing rapid adoption in certain verticals, like for example using AI in health care to rapidly discover new vaccines and early detection with outbreaks and robotic applications.

And we know how many weeks of inventory is and what parts of the channel. We've been draining down the channel inventory for Turing for some time. And meanwhile, we've also expected a very, very successful launch with Ampere. And even with our bullish demand expectation and all of the Amperes that we built, which is one of the fastest ramps ever, the demand is still overwhelming. And this I guess in a lot of ways is kind of expected, the circumstances are -- it's been a decade since we've invented a new type of computer graphics. I mean, two years ago, we invented the [indiscernible] and it set the industry on course to create the type of images that we see today. But, it's very clear that the future is going to look something much, much more beautiful. And we invented NVIDIA RTX to do that. And it has two capabilities, one based on ray tracing and the other one is based on artificial intelligence image generation.

We launched it two years ago and took our second generation to really achieve the level of quality and performance that the industry -- that they really expect. And now, the demand is just overwhelming. And so, we're going to continue to ramp fast. And this is going to be one of our most successful ramps ever. And it gives our installed base of some 200-million-plus GeForce gamers the best reason to upgrade in over a decade. And so, this is going to be a very large generation for us is my guess.",1.4784705,0.852
NVDA-2021-Q3-2020-11-18,70,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then, with respect to data center, we're ramping into A100. A100 is our first generation of GPUs that does several things at the same time. It's universal. We position it as a universal because it's able to do all of the applications that we in the past had to have multiple GPUs to do. It does training well. It does inference incredibly well. It does high-performance computing. It does data analytics. And so, it's able -- the Ampere architecture is able to do all of this at the same time. And so, the utilization for data centers is -- and the utility is really, really fantastic, and the reception has been great. And so, we're going to ramp into all of the world's clouds. I think, starting this quarter, we're now in every major cloud provider in the world, including Alibaba or Golan, and of course the giants, the Amazon, the Azure and Google Clouds. And we're going to continue to ramp into that. And then, of course, we're starting to ramp into enterprise, which in my estimation, long term will still be the largest growth opportunity for us, turning every industry into a AI, turning every company into AIs and augment it with Al and bringing the iPhone moment to all of the world's largest industries.

Yes, we've incorporated that 14th week into our guidance for both, revenue and OpEx. We will likely have incrementally positive impact on revenue, although it is tough to quantify, okay?

Jensen, my question is on competition from internally designed products by some of your larger cloud customers, Amazon and Google and others. We hear about competition from time to time. And I wanted to get your perspective. Is this a manageable risk? Is the right way to think that they are perhaps using more of your product in their public cloud, but they are moving to internal products for internal workloads? Just how should we think about this risk going forward? Thank you.",0.8702153,0.814
NVDA-2021-Q3-2020-11-18,78,Answer,2020-11-18,3,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Vivek. Most of the cloud vendors, in fact, I believe all of the cloud vendors use the same infrastructures largely for their internal cloud and external cloud, or have the ability to or largely do. And, there's -- the competition, we find to be really good. And the reason for that is this. It just suggests that acceleration -- they make it very clear, that acceleration is right path forward for training and inference. The vast majority of the world's training models are doubling in size every couple of months, and it's one of the reasons where our demand is so great. The second is inference. The vast majority of the world's inference is not on CPUs. And nothing is better than the whole world recognizing that the best way forward is to do inference on accelerators. And when that happens, our accelerator is the most versatile. It is the highest performance. We move the fastest. Our rate of innovation is the fastest because we're also the most dedicated to it, we're most committed to it, and we have the largest team in the world to it. Our stack is the most advanced, giving us the greatest versatility and performance. And so, we see spots of announcement here and there. But, they're also our largest customers.

The Mellanox networking connectivity business was up 80% year-over-year. I think, it was up about 13%, 14% sequentially. I know there was upside in October from one China customer, but it did grow 70% year-over-year last quarter, and you're still expecting 30% year-over-year growth next quarter. If I remember correctly, I think, InfiniBand is about 40% of that business; Ethernet Cloud is about 60%. Jensen, what are the big drivers, especially since we're in the midst of a cloud spending digestion cycle? And I just saw that the team announced their next-gen 400-gig InfiniBand solution, which should drive another strong adoption cycle with your supercomputer customers.

Our data center business consists of supercomputing centers, which is small, high-performance computing, which is a much larger part of super computing, much larger than supercomputing, and then hyperscale and enterprise, which about 50-50. Of the data center business, the accelerated computing part is not very much associated with digestion than others. It's much more associated with workloads and our new product cycles, the TCO that we bring in and AI inference, the type of models that the cloud service providers are deploying, whether they're deploying new AI models, based on deep learning, and how much of it that we -- how much of those workloads that we've completed, the porting to our accelerators and ready it for deployment.

The networking part of our business is driven by this idea of new hyperscale data center architecture called disaggregation. It's software disaggregation, not necessarily hardware disaggregation. Software disaggregation, where this type of software called Kubernetes orchestrate microservices that are deployed across the data center. So, one service, one application isn't monolithic running on one computer anymore. It's distributed across multiple computers and multiple nodes, so that the hyperscale data centers can more easily scale up and scale out according to the workloads and according to the demand on the data center.",1.4695143,0.659

If I look at the core business, excluding Mellanox, the core data center business, it was up about 6% sequentially the past two quarters, and your guidance sort of implies up about that much again in January, which is certainly good, and there is some cloud digestion. But, of course you have Ampere still ramping as well, which should be a pretty good tailwind. So, there seems to be some offsetting factors.

I wanted to go back to kind of the Mellanox question. I know prior to the acquisition, Mellanox was growing maybe in the mid to high-20% range. These last two quarters, it's grown over 75%. I guess, the simple question is how do you think about the growth rate for Mellanox going forward? And on that topic, we started to hear you talk more about BlueField and data processing units.

And every node of a data center is going to be a data center in itself. And the reason for that is because we want the attack surface to be basically zero. And today, most of the data centers are only protected as a periphery. But in the future, if you would like cloud computing to be the architecture for everything and every data center is multi-tenant, every data center is secure, then you're going to have to secure every single node. And each one of those nodes are going to be a software-defined networking, software-defined storage, and it's going to have per application security. And so, the processing that it will need to offload, the CPUs, is really quite significant. In fact, we believe that somewhere between 20% to 40% of today's data centers -- cloud data centers is the capacity, the throughput, the computational load is consumed running basically the infrastructure overhead.",1.4106097,0.913

We're going to offload that, number one; and number two, we're going to make every single application secure. And confidential competing, zero trust computing will become a reality. And so, the importance is really quite tremendous. And I believe therefore that every single server in the world will have a DPU inside someday, just because we care so much about security and just because we care so much about throughput and TCO.

And the vast majority of the world's data center is still built for the traditional hyper-converged architecture, which is all moving over to microservices-based disaggregate --software-defined disaggregated architectures. And that journey is still in its early days. And so, I fully expect future cloud data centers -- all future data centers are going to be connected with high-speed networking inside. They call it east-west traffic. And, all of the traffic will be secured. And so, imagine building firewalls into every single server. And imagine every single transaction, every single transmission inside the data center to be high speed and fully encrypted.

PUBG is doing great. And then we've got some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really, is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at.

And they were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this neural network - and the software that's written by deep learning in these frameworks are massive software.

First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it's reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach a decade and half ago. And I think at this point, with the number developers jumping on, the number of applications that's emerging, it's really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create that as a result of the throughput of a datacenter, we save people so much money just in cables alone, often times, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy.

NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,134,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework, so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time.",,0.572
NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,135,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame.",,0.0
NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,136,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If you take several hours per frame and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that's why they call it a render farm, it's a full datacenter designed just for rendering.",,0.077
NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,137,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And now we've created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on four Quadro GV100s. It takes four of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire datacenter and reduced it into one node. And we're now doing it in real time.",,0.542
NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,138,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so the amount of money that we can save, people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There's quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then there are of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them.",,0.882
NVDA-2019-Q1-2018-05-10,139,Answer,2018-05-10,1,2019,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so that's our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it and hopefully, more GPU servers will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we're super excited about RTX.",,0.925

I want to follow-up again on the seasonality. Understanding the prior comments, normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declining in Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around datacenter and the Volta ramp, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?",,0.551

They have a large amount of workload that's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. And as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation. We're forward compatible or backwards compatible. Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100. And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth. On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter. It was sequentially up. And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment. A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business.",1.0874957,0.878

Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it's a very small part of the high-performance computing. But that's also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers. And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown. The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion.

We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%. This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that. The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox. Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well. But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward. However, it's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go.

If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments. First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI. Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product. When you're watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song. All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend. All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today. It's the reason why they're collecting so much data.

But going forward, it's all based on deep learning approaches. The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics. And so this is very, very big deal. And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping. Second is cloud.

In the future, today -- it's not the case today. But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry. And whether it's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry.

And I think your question is really good because now it's a good time to think about where to double down. There's a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I say it, it'll be very sensible. The first is that the world's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud, that is going to accelerate. Every single company can't afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient.

And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that. The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system. The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar. And yet in the future, our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable. It's going to be infectious disease. And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods? And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company. We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day.",1.3785739,0.886

You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP. And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring. And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up. National labs are going to be gearing up. The third part is AI and robotics. We're going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely. NVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs. And without those robots helping us in our labs, we'll have a hard time getting our work done. And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak.

This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically, when we transition to a new architectures, margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the onset but tend to kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower. But also, we're going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles, which may offset those two.

I'm trying to understand how this kind of fits into the evolution of your solution set over time and the evolution of the demand for the applications. Is -- and I guess if I think about it going back, you had a solution, which is largely training based. And then you kind of introduced solutions that were targeted more inferencing. And now you have a solution, it sounds to my understanding that it solves both inferencing and training efficiently. And so I guess I'm wondering is 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line, is this part of the kind of general purpose computing or acceleration framework that you had talked about in the past, Jensen, where Ampere is kind of like an Ampere-class product? Or is this -- would you still -- should we still expect to see inferencing-specific solutions in the market and then training-specific solutions and then an Ampere solution for a different class application?

I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it. There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time. The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training. Deep learning training. And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up. It's like a supercomputer architecture. It's like a -- it's like a weather simulation architecture.

And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs. And so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals. Cloud renting was really quite ideal. And then we started to get into inference, and we're on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0.",1.4829487,0.908

And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that's out there. And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called [indiscernible], reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day. It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks. And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine. Scale out, it's for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds. And so notice, I've said 3 different architecture in a data center today. Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100.

So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history. I mean I don't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x. And it's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward. The second, it's the first architecture that is unified. We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center. From data processing, it's called ETO; the engine, which many of you probably know, it's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data.

And then it's -- Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference. And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload. And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic. You could reconfigure it. You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs. Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta. I mean it's really quite extraordinary. And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it's elastic. You could use in the cloud, you could use a for inference, you could use it for training. And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about.

We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning. And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video.",1.329659,0.318

From where we are today, it's only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry. It's going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting. We're also much more diversified out of the clouds. At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning. And today, hyperscale only represents about half. And so we've diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries. And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference. And as I mentioned earlier, we're working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so I think the conditions are a little different.

It is the best ramp we've ever had. The demand is the strongest we've ever had in data centers. And we're starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp. And so -- those are some of the differences. I think the conditions are very different.",1.6672408,0.973

NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,108,Question,2020-05-21,1,2021,Harlan Sur,JPMorgan Chase,"Jensen, the team has showed the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, like, for example, when you guys move from Volta DGX-1 to Volta DGX-2, you guys didn't change the GPU chipset. But by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things, you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance per GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center skilled implementation, how does Mellanox' Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well?",0.0473773,0.931
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,109,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Great. Thanks a lot, Harlan. I appreciate the question. So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it's really successful. People love it. It's the most advanced AI instrument in the world. If you're a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument. And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have. And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking. High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand. And the reason for that is because the problems we're trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is. And so it has to be distributed.",1.3978643,0.982
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,110,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable. There's reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind. And so -- and it's not just about the link speed. It's not mostly. I mean we just have a deep appreciation for software. It's a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design. And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class. And that's the reason why they're in 60% of the world's supercomputers. That's why they're in 100% of the AI supercomputers. And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none. Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up. And you're absolutely right. Now the question is why scale out? And the reason for that is this.",1.239063,0.974
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,111,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is the reason why they're doing so well. The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center. That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes. And you could rank it however you desire. And these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it's a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center. And because it's broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again. And that's the reason why they're doing so well. By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously. And so it's the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter. It's the reason why they've been growing 27% per year.",1.3279366,0.789
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,112,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they're low latency, they're incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it's Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases. And so they're -- it's a really fantastic stack. And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node. The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center. In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center. It's so incredible. It's just utterly incredible. You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center. And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security.",1.4419566,0.943
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,113,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing. And so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch. And then the second thing is we'd like to be able to innovate across the entire stack. You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks. And the reason for that is because software creates markets. You can't create new markets like we're talking about, whether it's computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI. All of that requires software stacks. It takes software to create markets. And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that. They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack. And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers. And so we're super, super excited about the team. And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack.",1.4064761,0.991

I think it was in one of your earlier responses, you said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I'm sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely, let's say, REX and REXs CPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that?",,0.71

And this, for computer architecture geeks and people who follow history, you know well that in the entire history of time, there are only two computing architectures that has made it so far, which is one of them is x86. The other one's ARM in any reasonable way. And if you get an ARM computer, you get an x86 computer, you can program it. And in fact, there's no such thing as an accelerated computing platform until we came along. And today, we're the only computing -- accelerated computing platform that you could really largely address. We're in every cloud. We're in every computer company. We're in every country.",1.4381674,0.599
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,117,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have every single size, and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics. This journey took 20-some-odd years. Inside our company, it took 20-some-odd years. And the we've been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company. And we made a general purpose. We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg, C for graphics, and then it became CUDA. And we've been working on accelerated computing for quite a long time. And I think at this point, it's a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and is well beyond it. The number of developers this year that support -- that we supported was almost 2 million developers around the world, and it's growing what appears to be exponentially. And so I think accelerated computing is now well established. NVIDIA-accelerated computing is well established. It's common sense, and people who are designing data centers expect to put accelerated computing in it. The question is how much? How much accelerated computing do you use? And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it?",1.5184292,0.931
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,118,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the three pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI. And the other two pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data. And so these three ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training. But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models. And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system. It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way. It's the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything. And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer's perspective.",1.6252153,0.647
NVDA-2021-Q1-2020-05-21,119,Answer,2020-05-21,1,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there's no way they could possibly make money. And so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company. And that engine is gigantic. It is just a gigantic engine. And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics. The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference. So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies. And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is. But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration.

Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as OpEx, but just given the full year guide, there's sort of a lot to unpack. And you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there's an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there's Mellanox and how you're thinking about investing in that asset. I guess I'm just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on OpEx as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities? Or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you're thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well? How do I understand that? And then, Jensen, just a quick one for you. It kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like health care. But in the other verticals, has the sort of shelter in place kind of hurt engagement? And could we actually come out of COVID with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets?",0.5012188,0.945

Let's start from the first perspective on the overall OpEx for the year. We've guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees. We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct. We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me, not this quarter, this year. And that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings, and you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly though, we are investing in our business. We see some great opportunities. You've seen some good results from our investment, and there's more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses.

A few -- some of the industries have been affected. We already mentioned automotive industry. The automotive industry has been grounded to a halt. Manufacturing hasn't largely stopped. And you saw that in our guidance. We expect automotive to be down 40% quarter-to-quarter. It's not going to remain that way. It's going to come back. And nobody knows what level is going to come back to you and how long, but it's going to come back. And there's no question in my mind that the automotive industry, they're hunkered down right now, but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. They have to, or they'll be extinct. It's not possible not to have autonomous capability in the future of everything that moves.",1.6772305,0.0

And of course, you're still responsible for driving it and -- but it just seems to be coasting down the road, reading your mind and helping you. And so I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer, Tesla, is enjoying. And the industry is going to go after it. The future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies. And they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets. And so they're going to go after it. And so this is -- I'm certain that this is going to come back. And well, I have every confidence is going to come back.

You're going to see a lot more robotic support in retail, you're going to see a lot more robotic support in warehouses, in logistics.

The product synergies are really incredible, and the product synergies include a lot of software development that went in and a lot of architectural development that went in. DGX comes with 9 Mellanox, Matt, as I mentioned. If you look at our data center, we ship -- before we ship DGXs to the customers, we ship it to our own engineers.

And so the first customer we ship to was ourselves. And then we started shipping as quickly as we could to all of the customers. You saw that in our data center, in our supercomputer. We have 170 -- 170 state-of-the-art, brand-new Mellanox switches. And almost 1,500 -- 200 gigabit per second Mellanox mix. And 15 kilometers of cables, fiber optic cables.

We announced our first edge computer between us and Mellanox in this new card, we call it the EGX A100. It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox' CX-6 Dx, which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing. It's incredible security and has a single route of trust, and it's virtualized. And so basically, we -- this EGX A100, when you put it into a standard center x86 server, turns that server into a cloud computer in a box. The entire capability of a cloud, of a state-of-the-art cloud, which is cloud native, it's secure, it has incredible AI processing, it's now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box. The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable. And so you could see all the different product synergies that we have in working together. We could have done Spark acceleration without the collaboration with Mellanox. They worked on this piece of networking software called UCX. We worked on nickel together. It made possible the infrastructure for large-scale distributor computing. I mean just the list goes on and on and on. And so we -- the two teams have great chemistry.

NVDA-2018-Q4-2018-02-08,106,Question,2018-02-08,4,2018,Unidentified,,"A lot of near-term items here on gaming. So, I'll switch it to longer term. Jen-Hsun at CES, I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally, and if my math is correct then that would be up about 2X over the last three to four years. So the question is, is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period? And given the recent demand dynamics, I think we've seen that INVIDIA's direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs of the prices that you intend. So as we look ahead, should we expect any change in channel management from the Company?",,0.755
NVDA-2018-Q4-2018-02-08,107,Answer,2018-02-08,4,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of that were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became global market and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world. The second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of the videogame. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and though they are going to get return on. Back when the videogame industry was quite small or PC game was small, it was too risky for developer to invest that much.",0.754392,0.886
NVDA-2018-Q4-2018-02-08,108,Answer,2018-02-08,4,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so now, an investor a developer could invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely for the realistic and emerged that just beautiful. And so when the production value goes up, the GPU technology that's needed to run it well goes up, it's very different than music, it's very different than watching movies, everything in videogames is emphasized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP with a technology has to go up.",0.4667585,0.898

In 10 years time, 15 years time, there can be another billion people on earth and those people are going to be gamers, we see more and more gamers. And not to mention that almost every single sport could be the virtual reality sport. So videogame is every sport so this sport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport.

In particular, I think in the past you've talked about expecting sort of a low in revenue growth in this market and till roughly the 2020 timeframe when autonomous driving kicks in more meaningful way. But of course you have the AI co-pilot that seems to be potentially ramping sooner, and you have at least one marquee customer that is ramping now I guess that volumes aren't quite that large on the autonomous driving side.

I wish I have more precision for you, but here some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capability, autonomous driving is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles.

I believe the path to that in our case has several elements. The first element is that in work for all these companies, whether they are Tier 1s or start up or OEMs or taxi companies or ride hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or piece of delivery on the shuttles. In order to deliver -- in order to create there autonomous driving capability, the first thing I have to do is train in your network.

GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core. The laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console.,0.9647168,0.909

In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that's up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs. Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the two new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.",1.2479109,0.929

We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA's platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Wal-Mart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Wal-Mart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.",1.2599814,0.844

This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances. AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA.",1.3291551,0.766
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,13,Remarks,2019-08-15,2,2020,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Delivering AI at scale isn't just about silicon. It's about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong. In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We have made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers. Also at the conference, we announced that by next year's end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA's full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM. Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China.

Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Finally, turning to automotive, Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including one particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA's end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day. Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world's transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard.

RTX as you know is - first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we have put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several 6 games in the last couple of months. There is going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It's pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create - with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular.

I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed - RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it's extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are - like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we're expecting it to grow through the end of the - through the second half and through next year. And one of the things that's really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high-definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we are ramping and of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us.",0.5180847,0.995

In the area of training, the thing that's really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft's MASS. And there are so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody's racing to go to. And so, these models are really, really large. It's over 1,000x larger than image models that we're training just a few years ago, and they're just gigantic models. It's one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area - so that's training in the hyperscalers. The second area where we are seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it's off of the most busy time of the day. You can't do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that's required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time - in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent. And so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we're seeing that AI is - the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we're seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we're seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it's a delivery robot or some kind of a Chat Bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There's some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we're the only AI platform that's available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for - in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that's one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we're seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that.",0.4336893,0.992

I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between - 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year - on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime - later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase?

Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we'll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We've reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements.",1.4976787,0.718
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,30,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there's no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it's going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple - a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There's a couple of different dynamics that's causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It's thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you cannot predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we've created is really the ideal architecture.",0.562866,0.98
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,31,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where - that's when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology - early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that's really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions instead of having a page of - a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one. The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they're using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that - used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you're putting all over the world. And that's the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we're about to enter into.",0.5583879,0.959
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,32,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it's life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It's a $100 trillion industry. We know it's going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that's just a matter of time before we realize its full potential. And so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that's why we're all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it's going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully - well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world.

Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that'll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you're guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well. Thank you.",,0.986
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,35,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I'm less good at normal pre - near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is - remains robust. It's double digits. It's a large part of our business. And - but more importantly, the two dynamics that I think are near term and that's going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference. If you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would - pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you're at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you're interested and how far you're willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human - a human understand a voice. And those models have to happen in just a few - ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it's not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that's the near-term opportunity, it's interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it's caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it and so near-term conversational AI inference. But, we are also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it's not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you're streaming is continuous. And so you don't want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we're seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term - two near-term drivers, and I think it's fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities.",0.5652773,0.998

Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we'll continue to see improvements on that as well.",1.1778087,0.849

Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I'm just wondering whether there's some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That's the first question. And then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I'm wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like two-third gaming and one-third data centers, something like that?

NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,42,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Volta data center products can churn that fast. We gamers could churn products quickly because they're bought and sold one at a time. But data centers data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We're still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so, you could just imagine the amount of software that's built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers. The software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that's one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so, when we're able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don't bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so, I think the way to think about Volta is that it's surely in its prime, and it's going to keep continue to do well all the way through next year.",0.5335859,0.937

And if you look at if you do channel checks all over, even though we've got a lot of products in the channel and we last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn't we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so, and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they're sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP.

The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer and how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it's an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It's a concept that's not easy to grasp. And so, I don't really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can't make it fit in my head.

The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the two systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay. And then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so, although the cars will take several years to go into production, we're seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so, we're the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses.

The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren't able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it's a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world's first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so, I think it's sensible that Turing's adoption is going to be rapid. The second element of Turing is something that we've never talked about before. We're mentioning it more and more because it's such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high-performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to we're now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it's still beautiful. And so, this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us.

And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so, this is an underserved market that we're excited to go serve with RTX Studio.",0.5194626,0.977

NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,56,Question,2019-08-15,2,2020,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein,"Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Colette. My first question is on data center. So, I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn't sound like broad-based growth to me unless like did the hyperscalers get worse or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what's going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed?",,0.957
NVDA-2020-Q2-2019-08-16,57,Answer,2019-08-15,2,2020,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So, to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we're discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we're continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing, some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that's for cloud instances or whether or not they're using it for internal use. So, we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI and we are just really pleased with what we are seeing in that growth this quarter.",1.0041783,0.963

Jensen, I'd love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically NVIDIA's had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that's changed where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think is what it's called at the endpoint device.

Those type of inference models are - could still be based on deep learning. It's function-specific. You don't have to change it very often, and you're running one or two models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective.

I mean, when you look back on last year and we look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, grew by a factor of three. And so I would expect that to happen, to continue. There's several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high performance computing cluster.",,0.879

We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that, that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend.",,0.382

And my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer-term, longer-term our position in self-driving cars, I think, is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019.

So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has upgraded to Pascal, and where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars in days picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teen. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you.",,0.846
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,31,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Well, let's say we typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of 100 million GeForce gamers, and we've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.",,0.494
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,32,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Thanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying a significant architecture, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year 2018 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year 2018. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line.",,0.954

And I'm wondering, you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first, and I'm wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys. And I'm wondering, if you could help, you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next and healthcare, retail, transport, finance, and I'm wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you're getting that visibility from.

Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very, very fast. But everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective, and you guys, everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that, over the next coming years, deep learning and AI will become the essential tool by which they do their computing.",,0.637
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,36,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Now, when they host it in the cloud, people out in the cloud use it for a variety of applications, and one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry-after-industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosts it up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics, to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to start-ups being able to build their company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use.",,0.848
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,37,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption, and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle, and that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned Enterprise, and enterprise, it has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their row data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX.",,0.944
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,38,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that, we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction. It has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it will do that automatically. And we need to process that for the world, for the planet.",,0.7
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,39,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And you can just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks, and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning, and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keep on going.

My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for a wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud, like you guys are introducing the GeForce NOW, be a way for the price points on VR to come down? And then I have a follow up for Colette.",,0.925

And our VR works, SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision processing, whether it's lens warping and such, it has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people, by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience.",,0.975
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,43,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier-to-use, with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on, and as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR - we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn't as big as we've seen the last several periods, and most of it came from Datacenter.

And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up, and it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a non-starter and to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that.

They're different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments.

NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,51,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Yes. First of all thanks, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn, and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence, and deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect a cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful.",,0.943
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,52,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning. AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now, the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. And the list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week, and papers are coming out of everywhere.",,0.557
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,53,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend, and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a little precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right.",,0.912

The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI, and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning.",,0.886
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,57,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers, and we integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes, you have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial, but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars and we train our networks to do so.",,0.01
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,58,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And as you know very well now, that deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human engineer computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned traditional hand featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars, and we realized that this is a much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex, and now we've had a lot of experience doing so.",,0.912
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,59,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack when you put them all together should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road.",,0.542

I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the inference market. Where are you in terms of hyperscale adoption for specialized inference type solutions, and how big you think that market can ultimately be? Thank you.",,0.869
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,62,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Yes. The inference market is going to be very large. And as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. And so I believe that long-term there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. So that's basically the architecture.",,0.859
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,63,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be arm devices. I think that that goes without saying. Arm will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit XNOR, 8-bit, and even some floating-point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast do you want to perceive it? And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that.",,0.681
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,64,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"In the future you're going to see in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics, and that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center. In the data center, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one number earlier, just mapping the earth, mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD, in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars. Now, that process is going to require, well, just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped.",,0.709
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,65,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"There's inferencing, which is called offline inferencing where you have to retrain a network after you deployed it, and you would likely retrain and re-categorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you used for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future. I continue to believe that and these are all opportunities for us.",,0.273

I had a question on gross margins. I think you're guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. And I'm guessing improvement of mix in Datacenter and parts of Gaming are driving this. But A, is that kind of the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? And B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business?",,-0.093
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,70,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Yeah, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. So you're correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is, we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher and value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms, that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here. Okay?",,0.637

Our deep learning stack starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There's so many different frameworks, from TensorRT to Caffe to Torch to Theano to MXnet to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks, and that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important.",,0.872

It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated into VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, I think we announced it in - we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to - we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX.

At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating. It showed in pretty significant decline in terms of the size and what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to sort of the Level 4 solution that you talked about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be sort of relative to the size of the car pretty small. So just curious to hear your comment on that, and what impact having this system in the car makes on it.",,0.979
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,79,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"We currently have DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX today is a one-chip solution for Level 3. And with two chips, two processors, you can achieve Level 4. And with many processors, you could achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next generation, so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with one processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with one processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve Level 5.",,0.625
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,80,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, failover functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. And I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard, and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, there's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing, in the perception processing in the car to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world.",,0.759
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,81,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of one or two companies. And so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and optimize across the entire range. Now, the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in a future, Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time.",,0.937

And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense.

Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the Gaming platform. You've now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate. So congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that's been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market. But at CES, you announced the GeForce NOW offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. So the question is, what will GeForce NOW do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your Gaming platform?",,0.983
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,85,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Yeah, I appreciate that. I think, first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. And that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a five-on-five. and so you kind of need four other friends. And so as a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well, that's one of the reasons why Tencent is doing so well. These two companies have benefited tremendously from the eSport dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world.",,0.977
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,86,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy these sports. When it's also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce, it gives you confidence and it gives you an edge, and for a lot of gamers it's just the gold standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one the reasons why gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most-watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It will soon be the largest sport in the world, and I can't imagine too many young people long term not coming into this sport somehow and as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons.",,0.98
NVDA-2017-Q4-2017-02-09,87,Answer,2017-02-09,4,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Now, you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. Now, the simple way to think about that is that there are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good capabilities, I think that the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud, and it took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that into cloud. So I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that, that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game or somebody would like to come into the gaming world, and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet.

NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,35,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"So first of all, Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year over year, and we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last generation processor - Volta is 100 times faster than Kepler, 100 times faster than Kepler just four years ago, and Kepler was already 10 times faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production.",,0.806
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,36,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"The application of data center - you asked a larger question about data center. Data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there's a very well accepted notion now that GPU acceleration of servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application, and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in number of servers. And so the value proposition and the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary.",,0.928
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,37,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there's training and there's high-performance computing. There's cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this quarter. And then there are also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production, and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video, consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing it with their friends.",,0.71
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,38,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time, and each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be - you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge.",,0.858
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,39,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"The one area where you're talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this. After four generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it's in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I've ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPUs is essentially a TPU that does a lot more. And we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud.",,0.494
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,40,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer. It's not an appliance. It's not a toaster. It's not a lightbulb. It's not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning, and our GPUs have evolved into something that can be absolutely world-class at TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.",,0.077

First, I was wondering if you could tell us how much Volta contributed to the data center revenue in the quarter. And what are your expectations for that ramp trajectory into the second half?

NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,55,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"First of all, it's very difficult to reverse-engineer from the first ramp of Volta any impact on gross margins, and the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you're still trying to stabilize yield. There are a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas, and Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it.

NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,58,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs [Network Interface Cards] and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars.",,0.856
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,59,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing cost is quite extraordinary. These are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate it, is probably in the several hundred dollars to close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value-add ultimately ends up.

The data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. There are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing.

It's certified with every major computer-aided design package. It's certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that was designed five years ago 10 years from now.

NVIDIA's CUDA GPU was, after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it's just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you're basically saying that it takes 10 times fewer servers to do the same job, or you could do 10 times as much work in the same amount of servers.

I think last year at this time, on the data center business, you disclosed I think a high level of growth for your cloud business. Your deep learning business was about half, and then a third HPC. I was wondering. As you're ramping Volta, how should we think about maybe the mix as you're entering the second half of the year between the PC/cloud and maybe the rest of the business for the data center?",,0.671
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,118,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Ambrish [Gabriel], that's a good question. Partly I'm not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application like Netflix, and it will be virtualized. They'll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID.",,0.66
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,119,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, healthcare, finance will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use AI and some of them will use traditional first principle physics-based algorithms. And it's hard to say exactly what the split is going to be. My guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that, but you're going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computation - the reason why we're so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms have the combination of both. Inside the card, we don't just use deep learning. We use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms including deep learning. And we're seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so that segment of the marketplace is hard to predict.",,0.85
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,120,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then there's just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly some of them are video. The amount of traffic that's going to be inferenced using deep learning is going be quite explosive. It's hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these, but I think on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges, and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient, and that the GPU with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a GPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we're just super-enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it's going contribute in the near term in percentages is going be hard to guess.",,0.839
NVDA-2018-Q2-2017-08-10,121,Answer,2017-08-10,2,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Okay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We're seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going all in on AI and jumping onto our new Volta GPU.

Our PC gaming platform, GeForce, is strong and getting stronger than ever, and I think the reason for that is several, several folds. First of all, our GPU architecture is just superior. We dedicated an enormous amount of effort to advancing our GPU architecture. I think the engineering of NVIDIA is exquisite, and our craftsmanship is really unrivaled anywhere. The scale of our company in building GPUs is the highest and the largest of any company in the world. This is what we do. This is the one job that we do.

Over the last 10 years, we've started to evolve our company to much more of a platform company, and it's about developing all the algorithms that sit on top of our GPUs. A GPU is a general purpose processor. It's a general purpose processor that's dedicated to a particular field of computing, such as computer graphics here, physics simulation, et cetera. But the thing that's really important is all of the algorithms that sit on top of it, and we have a really, really fantastic team of computational mathematicians that captures our algorithms and our know-how into GameWorks, into the physics engine, and recently the really amazing work that we're doing in VR that we've embodied into VRWorks.",0.988288,0.943

And this deep learning - deep learning, as you know, as you probably are starting to hear, is a brand-new computing model that takes advantage of the massively parallel processing capability of a GPU along with the big data that many companies have to essentially have software write algorithms by itself. Deep learning is a very important field of machine learning, and machine learning is now in the process of revolutionizing artificial intelligence making machines more and more intelligent and using it to discover insight that, quite frankly, isn't possible otherwise.",1.0733724,0.897

The thing, though, about HPC, about GPU computing is as you know, this is a new computing model, and we've been promoting this computing model now for close to seven years. And a new computing model doesn't come along very frequently. In fact, as I know it, I don't know if there's a new computing model that's used anywhere that has been revolutionary in the last 20 years.

And so it's across the board. We're seeing great traction in gaming. Gaming, as you know, has multiple growth drivers. Partly the gaming is growing because the production value of games is growing, partly because the number of people who are playing is growing. eSports is more popular than ever.

Yes, our gross margins within the quarter for Q1 did hit record levels just due to very strong mix across our products on the Maxwell side both from a gaming perspective as well as what we have in enterprise for pro visualization and datacenter. As we look to Q2, a good review of where we also see gross margins and those are looking at a non-GAAP at about 58%.

The thing that's most important is that the value's greater than ever, and one of the things that we know is games are becoming richer than ever. The production values become richer than ever. And gamers want to play these games with all of the settings maxed out. They would like to play at a very high resolution. They want to play it at very high frame rates. When I announced the 1080, I was showing all of the latest and most demanding games running at twice the resolution of a game console, at twice the frame rate of a game console, and it was barely even breathing hard.

One of the things that we do know is that high-performance computing is an essential and central approach for one of the most important computing models that we know today, which is machine learning and deep learning. Hyperscale datacenters all over the world is relying on this new model of computing, so that it could harvest, it could study all of the vast amounts of data that they're getting to find insight for individual customers to make the perfect recommendation, predict what somebody would anticipate - would look forward to, in terms of news or products, or whatever it is.",0.5125732,0.906

First of all, training is production. You can't train a network just once. You have to train your network all the time. And every single hyperscale company in the world is in the process of scaling out their training because the networks are getting bigger. They want their networks to do even better. The difference between a 95% accurate network and a 98% accurate network or a 99% accurate network could mean billions of dollars of differences to Internet companies, and so this is a very big deal. And so they want their networks to be larger. They want to deploy their networks across more applications, and they want to train their network with new data all the time. And so training is a production matter. It is probably the largest HPC high performance computing application on the planet that we know of at the moment. And so we're scaling - we're ramping up training for production for hyperscale companies.",0.7223562,0.637
NVDA-2017-Q1-2016-05-13,94,Answer,2016-05-12,1,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the other hand, I really appreciate you asking about the inferencing. We recently - well, this year, several months ago we announced the M4, the Tesla M4 that was designed for inferencing. And it's a little tiny graphics card, a little tiny processor, and it's less than 50 watts. It's called the M4. And at GTC, I announced a brand-new compiler called the GPU Inference Engine, GIE. And GIE recompiles the network that was trained so that they can be optimally inferenced at the lowest possible energy. And so not only are we already 50 watts, which is low-power, we can also now inference at a higher energy efficiency than any processor that we know of today, better than any CPU by a very, very long shot, better than any FPGA. And so now hyperscale companies could use our GPUs for both training, and they use exactly the same architecture for inferencing and the energy efficiency is really fantastic.",0.7330348,0.978
NVDA-2017-Q1-2016-05-13,95,Answer,2016-05-12,1,2017,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Now, the benefit of using GPU for inferencing is that you're not just trying to inference only. You're trying to oftentimes decode the image or you could be decoding the video. You inference on it and you might even want to use it for transcoding, which is to re-encode that video and stream it to whoever it is that wants to share live video with.",0.2056493,0.671

And so we're seeing lot of success in M4. I expect M4 to be quite a successful product. And hyperscale datacenters, my expectation, we'll start to ramp that into production Q2, Q3, Q4 timeframe.",0.6355494,0.948

So in our automotive business, there's definitely a process even before we're shipping platforms into the overall cars that we're work jointly with the auto manufacturer start-ups and others on what may be a future product. Many of those agreements continue, and will likely continue going forward, and that's what you see incorporated in our automotive business. So yes, you'll probably see this continue and go forward.

The thing to remember is that we're not selling chips into a car. We're not selling - you know that DRIVE PX is the world's first autonomous driving car computer that's powered by AI. It's powered by deep learning. And we're seeing lot of success with DRIVE PX, and as Colette mentioned earlier, there's some 80 companies that we're working with, whether it's tier 1s, or OEMs, or start-up companies all over the world that we're working with in this area of autonomous vehicles. And the thing to realize is you're not selling a chip into that car. You're working with a car company to build an autonomous driving car. And so that process requires a fair amount of engineering.

And whether we get there 100%, 90%, 92%, 93% is in my mind completely irrelevant. The endeavor of getting there and making your car more and more autonomous - initially, of course, we would like to have a virtual co-pilot. Having a virtual co-pilot is the way I get to work every day. Every single day I drive my Model S and every single day I put it into autonomous mode and every single day it brings me joy. And I'm not confessing necessarily, but texting a little bit is okay. And so I think that the path to full autonomy is going to be paved by amazing capabilities along the way.

And can you give us any metrics, Jen-Hsun, for how to think about the size of this opportunity for you? I know it's hard but things like server attach rates, what percent of servers you could attach?

The truth is that nobody really knows how big this deep learning market is going to be. Until a couple of two years, three years ago, it was really even hard to imagine how good the results were going to be. And if it wasn't because of the groundbreaking work that was done at Google and Facebook and other researchers around the world, how would we have discovered that it was going to be superhuman? The work that recently was done at Microsoft Research, they've achieved superhuman levels of inferencing that - of image recognition and voice recognition that's really kind of hard to imagine, and these networks are now huge. The Microsoft research network, superdeep network is 1,000 layers deep. And so training such a network is quite a chore.

And we're not - we had the benefit of being early, because we saw the power of this technology early on. But we're seeing deep learning being used now in medical imaging all over the world. We're seeing it being used in manufacturing. It's going to be used for scientific computing. More data is generated by high performance computers and supercomputers than just about anything. They generate through simulation. They generate so much data that they have to throw the vast majority of it away. For example, the hadron collider. Whenever the protons collide, they throw away 99% of the data, and they're able to barely keep up with just that 1%.

This is going to be the next big computing model. The way that people compute is that in the past, software programmers wrote programs, compiled it, and in the future, we're going to have algorithms write the software for us.

Jen-Hsun, in the last few months, we have seen a lot of announcements from Intel, from Xylinx and others describing other approaches to the AI market. My question is how does the customer make that decision, whether to use a GPUs or an SPGA or an ASIC, right? What is -- what can remain a competitive differentiator over the longer term? And does your position in the trail market also then maybe give you a leg up when they consider solution for the inference part of the problem?",0.270933,0.894

So first of all, we have one architecture and people know that our commitment to our GPUs, our commitment to CUDA, our commitment to all of the software stacks that run on top of our GPUs, every single one of the 500 applications, every numerical solver, every CUDA compiler, every tool chain across every single operating system in every single computing platform, we are completely dedicated to it. We support the software first long as we shall live. And as a result of that the benefits to their investment in CUDA just continues to accrue. I -- you have no idea how many people send me notes about how they literally take out their old GPU, put in a new GPU. And without lifting a finger, things got 2x, 3x, 4x faster than what they were doing before, incredible value to customers. The fact that we are singularly focused and completely dedicated to this one architecture in an unwavering way allows everybody to trust us and know that we will support it for as long as we shall live, and that is the benefit of an architectural strategy.",0.6035136,0.988

And we all know that nobody's going to be able to support five architectures forever. And as a result, something has to give and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one. And if there's five architectures, surely, over time, 80% of them will be wrong. And so I think that our advantage is that we are singularly focused. With respect to FPGAs. I think FPGAs have their place. And we use FPGAs here at NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGAs is a chip design. It's able to be a chip for -- it's incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip, and so that's it's advantage.",1.1588012,0.947

So what happens is when a crypto -- when a currency -- digital currency market becomes very large, it entices somebody to build a custom ASIC for it. And of course, Bitcoin is the perfect example of that. Bitcoin is incredibly easy to design in its specialized chip form. But then what happens is a couple of different players starts to monopolize the marketplace. As a result, it chases everybody out of the mining market and it encourages a new currency to evolve, to emerge.

We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown nine consecutive quarters. It has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we're looking at. We have just never created a product like that before. And I think the reason for that is several folds. The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end. That's just laws of physics. The end of Moore's Law is just laws of physics.

And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator. The modern GPU, we just left the word G -- the letter G in there. But these processors are domain specific parallel accelerators. And they're enormously complex. They're the most complex processes built by anybody on the planet today. And that's the reason why IBM uses our processors for the world's largest supercomputers, that's the reason why every single cloud, every single -- every major cloud, every major server maker in the world has adopted NVIDIA GPUs.

Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We took that position at that time to say there are plenty other more use cases that we can think about where accelerated computing will continue to takeoff. Many of the things that we have in place in the markets that we approached today, still approaching overall gaming and a very significant part of our business, but many have also now followed us in terms of our work, in terms of the Datacenter, our work in terms of Pro Visualization and Graphics for the enterprise as well as our work in terms of Automotive.",2.226091,0.493

Now the markets that we chose were not something that we've branched off and said, let's give it a try.

Over 10 years ago, we began network to allow the GPUs to be programmable. That program ability was the building of CUDA and building on now Version 10 of our overall CUDA platform that allows us both that underlying program ability, but also allowing components, libraries and very specific parts of CUDA focused on different parts of our industry.

NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,53,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,"Okay, great. And what are your expectations for demand for Turing versus Pascal heading into the holiday season, especially given the price difference between the two cards?",0.8215626,0.802
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,54,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes. When you think about our overall pricing, and when you think about our overall cards. We will be selling probably for the holiday season, both our Turing and our Pascal overall architecture. Remember, Turing is a leap forward in terms of overall capabilities. The performance improvement is much greater than the overall price. What that means is you are getting for your dollar spent tremendous more improvement.",0.1374188,0.917
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,55,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"And then I think from a value perspective is essentially how we approach our pricing. We want the overall game or to feel. Yes, I'm getting more performance. I'm getting more overall quality of my experience for every generation we say. It's still to be seen in terms of what that mix is, how will see this. But we're excited in terms of the portfolio of games that are coming out for ray-tracing. All the other types of games and the beginning of that holiday season is in front of us.",1.045961,0.859
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,56,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,"And what are some titles for the games that you're most excited about? Maybe I should ask this question to your son, who is a gaming enthusiast.",0.3292392,0.636
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,57,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"My sons are gaming enthusiasts in terms of that. So we talked about that as we spoke at our overall earnings call. Battlefield 5 as well as anticipated and I'm sure it will be here soon and backup on track, but there's a long list in terms of games that are coming out for the success.",0.8574745,0.799
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,58,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,"Great. Moving on to the Automotive segment. At your Analysts Day, Jensen, talked about that he believes every vehicle will be autonomous in the future. And the autonomous vehicle, is it a percent of 60 billion TAM by 2035. Can you talk about in videos approach with virtual miles and how that approach is different from competition like Intel, Mobileye?",1.3599454,0.765
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,59,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes. So when you think about the market for autonomous driving, there's many different ways that this will all be put together and when we think about every single type of card. I think historically we've looked at this as only a passenger car or essentially a high-end type of card, type of market. But yes, that is still a very important part and a key component of it. But you can also think about the use of autonomous driving as it really relates to a more taxi approach or Robotaxis as what we are hearing and referring to it.",0.4549675,0.757
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,60,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"That says in a confined area, whether that be a square mile or larger, you could actually map out that situation and get it to where it is fully autonomous. That is no steering wheel, no driver, no brake pedal. It essentially has been able to move around that area. You will see and probably see the more outside more Robotaxis in your area, as they are testing those overall surrounding areas.",0.1703807,-0.681
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,61,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"As we also work in terms of high-end level 2, level 3 in terms of those markets. This also doesn't even address the ability in terms of cargo and trucks in terms of what we can do in terms of AI and improve their overall productivity of transporting goods across and using autonomous in terms of those. So it's a broad and wide overall market. When we think about the use of overall virtual, what we're discussing there is to say, in order for you to create a safe environment for an autonomous car, you are testing data over and over and over again. What becomes challenging is the ability to derive tested data that you see actually out in the environment.",0.4837512,0.902

So different than our competitors, both from having a platform of today that they can also develop on as well as an ability to do simulated types of scenarios to assure the safety, which is their number one concern that they bring that to market.",0.5264624,0.906
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,64,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,Good. What are some of the milestones we need to hit to see acceleration in your auto sales? Is it BMO coming out? What are the things that need to see to start painting a trajectory for your auto sales growth?,1.5138178,0.533
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,65,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Well, it still - when we think about autonomous driving going forward as we've discussed, there's a significant amount of development work. It is a significant amount of compute. They have the platforms that they are testing against and really trying to determine what is their best path in terms of market. So we're probably still in the medium-term in terms of when that gets to market. In the meantime, you have seen us already continue to focus on that high-end infotainment side, really talking about AI inside of the cockpit.",0.4224698,0.836
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,66,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M.

You'll also see us in terms of time-to-time different development contracts as we work with companies in terms of on the software and leveraging our platforms for those future autonomous cars. Longer term, we'll see the production value boards and platforms that will incorporate into the cars, the trucks and Robotaxis.",0.0538533,0.772
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,67,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,Okay. And can you help us map the ASP or your dollar opportunity over time as you go from autopilot to a driverless Robotaxi? What kind of ASPs we should expect from your partners?,0.4118048,0.776
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,68,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Sure. So when you think about what we're building for autonomous driving, it's not a footprint that every single configuration for each one of these cars will be the same. They're all custom configurations. Redundancy is an important piece. Overall amount of compute that lasts in the car over many, many years is also extremely important. So you see custom configurations that are being built.",1.2404828,0.599

Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"You may have a case where you have a single SoC and a GPU, you could have two SoCs, two GPUs or any other types of overall combinations. We can see by the time we moved to overall Robotaxis that we can extend an overall ASPs that could get over a $1,000 or into the thousands in terms of their, that's likely some of that that will produce and also incorporating the key components of the software that is also included with those platforms.",0.6429898,0.178

What maybe perceived as just a small piece of the market, but everybody has direct and indirect impact from what is currently occurring in terms of all the tariffs. Again, our focus is compiling together what we need to do. We will make sure that we follow all laws in all types of countries, and I think that's the best thing we can do right now.",0.3625812,0.875
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,72,Remarks,2018-11-15,3,2019,Atif Malik,Morgan Stanley,Great. Let me pause here and see if any questions in the audience.,1.1344251,0.625
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,73,Question,2018-11-15,3,2019,Unidentified Analyst,,"Thank you. Regarding automotive, recently [indiscernible] elaborated on custom hardware known as hardware free, and you stated that Tesla developed the world's most advanced computer for autonomous driving even better than NVIDIA. So please comment on that? And how do you see competitive edge over Tesla?",,0.928
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,74,Question,2018-11-15,3,2019,Unidentified Analyst,,And second on competition with AMD. AMD is something 7-nanometer [indiscernible] some customers. So could you tell me what's your competitive advantage in 10-nanometers versus 7-nanometers from AMD and when can we expect 7-nanometers from NVIDIA?,,0.402
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,75,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Okay. So first talking about an autonomous platform. Our relationship, we were very pleased with in terms of with Tesla and helping them bring the very first autopilot to the road. We with our overall architecture more than three years ago, brought the very first one to the market, extremely successful partnership in terms of there. Their decision to try and build their own is their decision, probably a little different than I would say most of the other auto manufacturers knowing the importance of top end computing platform for their overall cars.",0.858403,0.929
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,76,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"The overall comparisons, they maybe comparing about something that is three years old, and as you know, we have such a significant workforce that is always pushing out tremendous platforms each and every quarter or even every month in some cases. So comparison in terms of what we have today, I think we have probably one of the highest performing platforms today. But again, we're very pleased to be a part of overall Tesla at the time.",1.9670381,0.612
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,77,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Now our future generations, as we think about, no changes in terms of their - we make no changes, of course, just like all do and we carefully consider in terms of those overall changes. Our performance improvement that we have with Turing without overall change in the overall node is absolutely phenomenal. Meaning the overall GPU has so many abilities through the overall architecture and design to concentrate on performance.",1.8867224,0.597
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,78,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So there's always a right time to think about when those right changes will be going forward. We haven't announced in terms of any new architectures coming down the pipeline. We always like to keep that a surprise, but stay tune. We'll talk about that.",2.0557103,0.318
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,79,Question,2018-11-15,3,2019,Unidentified Analyst,,"I think at the Investor Day, you had talked about over the past five years, shareholder [indiscernible] 70% or 75% of free cash flow, can't remember the exact number. If we look at fiscal 2018, you're going to be only 25%, 30% free cash flow. How should we think about that going forward? That's the first question. Should we think about kind of 70%, 75% number going forward? And even if we did, how can you - can you just talk about the rationality behind that when most of the major tech companies still be building cash and most of the major tech companies are reducing their net cash position, you are just increasing over that type of scenarios. Can you just talk about that?",,0.829
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,80,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,Sure. So what we discussed at our overall Analyst Day was our uses of cash. Our number one use of cash in terms of overall cash is to obviously focus in terms of investment in the business. We have tremendously large markets in front of us. We want to make sure we are investing effectively for that.,1.5009285,0.796
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,81,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"But then it comes to the case and in terms of the free cash flow and the use. Our capital investments to support our business are also important for us to understand. We do have to think about - we sell supercomputers. We actually work on supercomputers as well. So we have that as well in terms of our engineers, in terms of building that out. Then that comes to distributing that overall cash.",0.95961,0.875
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,82,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"We'll look at M&A from time-to-time. As we know historically, we have essentially been more in terms of in the small and medium case in terms of what we buy to add-on to our existing overall platform and both those that's generally been our position. Then it gets to returning cash to overall shareholders.",0.8630455,0.0
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,83,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"I think we've kept up quite well. You're right. Our life to-date since restarting back in 2013 has been over 75%. We feel very good about that return and we will continue to look in terms of that cash to say how do we increase that. It's not something that you can keep up with every single day. So of course, this is still an extremely important part of our capital return program is to return that. And so you'll see us continue to do that going forward. Now in terms of our overall cash levels, our cash levels for our overall market capital are within reason in terms of that to have. But again, we are going to focus on capital return for the long-term.",1.0,0.839
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,84,Question,2018-11-15,3,2019,Unidentified Analyst,,"Yes, instead of the margin profile of Turing versus Pascal, I guess, there is maybe a bigger [indiscernible] cost that also has a healthy step-up in ASP. So that's where you think about that, whether that's sort of headwind or tailwind?",,0.66
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,85,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"Yes, when you think about our overall pricing, our pricing is again going back to our conversations, really focused on the value that we can overall deliver. We always have a mix of overall gross margin across our overall platforms within gaming. Mix is probably our largest contributor to gross margin. How that mix ways out, not only within gaming, but also our mix within the other platforms that we have in our portfolio.",1.0608171,0.102
NVDA-2019-Q3-2018-09-06,86,Answer,2018-11-15,3,2019,Colette M. Kress,Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,"So in the same manner, we have different overall gross margins across our portfolio of gaming.

Instead of months, it could be days. It's essentially like having a time machine. And secondarily, for IT managers, it translates to lower energy consumption and, most importantly, it translates to a substantial reduction in datacenter cost, whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers, and so a pretty big deal.

Especially in the beginning, several years ago when we started working on GPU computing and bringing this capability into datacenters, we relied on supercomputing centers in the beginning and then we relied on remote workstations, datacenter workstations, if you will; virtualized workstations. And then increasingly, we started relying on - we started seeing demand from hyperscale datacenters as they used our GPUs for deep learning and to develop their networks.

Our GPUs now has the ability with one architecture to run all of those applications that I mentioned from graphics virtualization to scientific computing to AI. Second, we used to be in datacenters, but now we're in datacenters, supercomputing centers as well as hyperscale datacenters. And then third, the number of applications, industries that we affect is growing. It used to start with supercomputing.

That it is so available everywhere; it's available in PCs, it's available from every computer company in the world, it's in the cloud, it's in the datacenter, it's in laptops. GPU is no longer a niche component. It is a large scale, massively available, general purpose computing platform.

I'll start backwards and answer the FPGA question first. FPGA is good in a lot of things, and anything that you could do in an FPGA if the market opportunity is large, you could always - it's always better to develop an ASIC. And FPGA is what you use when the volume is not large. FPGA is what you use when you're not certain about the functionality you want to put into something. FPGA is largely useful when the volume's not large, because you can build an ASIC and build a full custom chip that obviously can deliver more performance, not 20% more performance but 10 times better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs.

That it's not just about detecting objects, it's about perception of the environment around you, it's about reasoning, reasoning about what to do, what is happening and what to do and to take action based on that reasoning, and to be continuously learning.

Q3 GAAP EPS is $0.97. 83 % from a year earlier non-GAAP EPS was a $1.17 up 60 % from a year ago adjusting for our stocks [Indiscernible]. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion up from $1.3 billion a year earlier, and down from $2.7 billion in the final quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayment for long-term supply agreement. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect sequential growth to be driven by datacenter and gaming more than offsetting a decline in CMP. Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion, +/ - 2 %. GAAP and non-GAAP Gross margin are expected to be 65.3% and 67 % respectively, +/ - 50 basis points.

I guess I wanted to ask about Omniverse, obviously a lot of excitement around that. I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success, in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it 12 months? And how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse? I know you've talked about 40 million total 3D designers. I think that actually doubled, what you talked about back in August. I'm just curious of how we as financial analysts should start to think about that opportunity materializing.",0.0564933,0.982

Developer engagement connected with developers around the world, 2. Applications being developed by enterprises, 3. The connection of designers and creators among themselves. Those are the nearest term -- and I would say that in mind, type of a definitive success. Near-term also should be revenues and Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote and I'll highlight a few of them right now. One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect 3D and digital designing world. Think of Adobe as a world, think of Autodesk as a world, think of Rivet as a world, these are design world in the sense that people are doing things in it. They're creating things in it and it has its own database. We made it possible for these worlds to be connected, for the very first time. And for it to be shared like in cloud document. That's not been possible ever before. You can now share work with each other, you could see each other's work. You could collaborate. And so in a world of remote working, Omniverse's collaborative ability is going to be really appreciated, and that should happen right away.",0.1860145,0.934

And that drives, of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales. The second use case is digital twins and you show -- you saw examples of how several companies that are seeing using Omniverse to create a digital twin of that city so that they could optimize radio placements and radio energy used for being forming. You saw BMW using it for their factories. You're going to see people using it for warehouse, logistics warehouse, to plan and to optimize their warehouses and to plan the robots. And so digital twin applications are absolutely immediate. And then remember robots has several clients. There's the physical robots that you saw and a physical robot with the self-driving cars. A physical robot could be the car itself turning into a robot so that it could be an intelligent assistant. I demonstrated probably the -- in my estimation, the largest application of robots in the future and it's avatars.",0.2848777,0.97
NVDA-2021-Q3-2021-11-18,23,Answer,2021-11-18,3,2021,Jen-Hsun Huang,"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We built Omniverse Avatar to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology. We'll consider vision with speed recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation, speech synthesis, recommender systems. All of that integrated into 1 system and money in real, time that avatar's system is essentially a robotic system. And the way that you would use that is for example, the $25 million or so retail stores, restaurant, places like airports, train stations and office buildings and such where you can have intelligent avatars doing a lot of assistance. They might be doing checkout, they might be doing check in, they might be doing at customer support. And all of that can be done with avatars, as I've demonstrated. So the virtual, the virtual robotics application, digital vibes or avatars, it is going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity. So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse, each 1 of the main users, and the main users could be one of the 20 million creators, or 20 million designers the 40 million creators and designers around the world when they share Omniverse, each one of the main users would be $1,000 per user per year.",0.0554599,0.976

And so there's 100 million cars to be $1,000 per car per year. And in the case of 25 million or so places where you would have a digital Avatar as customers support or check out smart retail or smart warehouse or wherever it is, those Avatars are also -- would each individually be a new account, and so they would be $1000 per Avatar per year. And so, it's like -- those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us and I demonstrated the application during the keynote. And then of course, behind all of that, call it a couple of 100 million on a digital agents, intelligent agent, some of the interim for low by some of them avatars at $1,000 per agent, per year.

First of all this could be the graphics, second, is physics simulation, because we're talking about things in world that has to be believable. So it has to obey the laws of physics.

Jensen, it seems like every year there seems to be a new set of demand drivers for your accelerated processing ecosystem, there's gaming, then neural network in an AI, and then blockchain and the ray-tracing. And if the 5 or 6 years ago, you guys showed a bunch of virtual reality demos which were really exciting at your Analyst Day excitement down -- died down. Now it seems to be resurfacing seen particularly with Omniverse Avatar capability at Facebook shining a light on opportunity. So the 2 questions from that are, how close is your Omniverse Avatar took to morphing into like a mass market technology that everybody uses daily. If you can talk about -- like you said, that everybody is going to be a gamer. Everybody is going be used -- everybody is going to be a Omniverse Avatar, you said. And maybe the bigger picture is: Is it reasonable to think about new killer app coming out every year? Is there a parallel that we should think about with previous competing markets that we could think about for the computing era that we're entering right now? Thank you.",0.4264554,0.965

Chips are enablers, but just don't create markets, software creates market. I've explained over the years that accelerated computing is very different than channel purpose computing. The reason for that is because you can't just write a C compiler and compile quantum physics into a chip and it does it. You can't just compile a stranger's equation and have it distributed across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes that have it be fast. You can't do that with computer graphics, you can't do that for artificial intelligence, you can't do that for robotics, you can't do that for most of the interesting applications in the world. Because we really went out of theme with PCs that people are saying they're not because it's not true, it's abundantly clear that the amount and instruction level parables embedded can squeeze out of that system. It is, although not zero, is incredibly hard. It's just incredibly hard and there's another approach and we've been allocating. It's already confusing for some time and now people really see the benefit of it.

And the new stack is hard because you have to understand the application, you have to understand the algorithms, the mathematics. You have to understand computer science to distribute across, to change something that was single threaded and make it multi-threaded, maybe something that would be done sequentially and make it positive in parallel. You break anybody, you break storage, you break networking, you break everything. And so it takes a fair amount of expertise and that's why we say that over the years, over nearly the course of 30 years, we've become a full-stack Company because we've been trying to solve this problem for practically 2 decades.

We said nearly 4 years ago, 3.5 years ago, that if its going to be one of the great computer science challenger, really proving to be so.

NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,37,Operator,2017-05-09,1,2018,Operator,,Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.,,0.34
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,38,Question,2017-05-09,1,2018,Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC,,"Thanks for taking my questions. On the HPC and data center business, clearly impressive growth, and I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of two different areas: GPU as a service versus the cloud companies' own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets.",,0.949
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,39,Question,2017-05-09,1,2018,Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC,,"And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver.",,0.648
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,40,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for data center is growing very fast, and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There's in enterprise the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower. And mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID, and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there.",,0.979
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,41,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really have two pillars. There's the Internet service provision part, where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development.",,0.718
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,42,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities of Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. That's on the cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, it's the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun (18:31 - 19:03) by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on VM video architecture, so we're seeing a lot of growth there as well. So I think the nut of it all is that we're seeing data center growth and GPU computing across the board.",,0.933
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,43,Question,2017-05-09,1,2018,Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC,,"As a follow-up if I may, on the gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand, and you see 12 months of very good visibility into growth. And I was wondering if you see the data center numbers come in quarter after quarter here. To what extent do you think the data center demand that you're seeing is - I know probably you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the data center is secular versus you have a new platform and there's just platform-driven demand?",,0.822
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,44,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"PC gaming is growing. There's no question about that. E-sports is growing the number of players in e-sports. The number of people who are enjoying e-sports is growing. MOBA [Multiplayer Online Battle Arena] is growing. I think it's amazing the growth of MOBA and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great. Battlefield is doing great, and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on consoles, but the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PC. Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, so I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow, and it's hard to imagine people [audio gap] (21:03 - 21:39) around in another amazing world. So I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the videogame market is going to continue.",,0.984

Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it's on the competitive landscape in your data center business. There has been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA's sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business?",,0.931
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,47,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different.",,0.612
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,48,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"There are three major pillars of computing up in the cloud or in large data centers, hyperscale. One pillar is just internal use of computing systems, for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable.",,-0.295
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,49,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so that first pillar is the market that we - is a segment of the (23:46 - 24:18) once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers have a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on a hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. (24:42) Are we okay? Are we still on?",,0.433

NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,51,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"No, Vivek, I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing as it turns out is far, far less complicated than training. It's a trillion times less complicated, a billion times. It's a trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types.

The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us, and it's a growth opportunity for us.

It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stack that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable, and that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing.

And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond a TV. So if you have a 4K or you want 120 hertz or some people are even driving it to 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K at 60 frames a second or 30 frames a second.

How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is gaming growing overall? What are the driving dynamics of gaming, whether it's team sports or MOBA or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out.

Maybe it was somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that, and really that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast-forward a couple years, we now have basically everybody.

And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it, because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who know how to build computing platforms like this - and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small form factor.

I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on automotive with my first question, and it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter.

First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Marc [Andreessen] said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software, and it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation, and it will likely be the transmission.

First of all, we know that this is the - we know that some - the world calls it the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of two dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic of course is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling.

NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,97,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"The easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely - if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it, but we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels, all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerated computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with.

And then the other question I had was regarding Colette's comment that HPC had doubled year on year. Just wondering if you had any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses, or are there other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products?",,0.889
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,106,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of - not a collection, but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TITech in Japan. There are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputing centers for open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers.",,0.0
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,107,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours, and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. I think last year McDonald's was at GTC, and I hope they come this year as well.",,0.881
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,108,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products and make sure they're as reliable as possible.",,0.178

Just curious, Jen-Hsun, you've seen a half dozen, dozen private companies going after the desiccant (54:35) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a CPU maybe wasn't fair, but I was just curious your response to these claims of 10x, 100x, 500x performance better than a GPU.",,0.899
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,111,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"It's not that it's not fair. It's just not right; it's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair; I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out, and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have three different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing, and inferencing is a zero opportunity for us, a zero business for us at the moment. We do 0% of our business in inferencing, and it's 100% on CPUs.",,0.87
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,112,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons, and you can look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal was probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first-generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas, but inferencing is new to us. There are 10 million CPUs in the world in the cloud, and today many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that.",,0.7
NVDA-2018-Q1-2017-05-09,113,Answer,2017-05-09,1,2018,Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.,,"But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes, and I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world, and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40 is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better job.",,0.947

I remember at CES you had mentioned a leasing model that almost effectively target the low-end consumer of gaming products. So I'm just wondering if that will be some catalyst in the back half.
